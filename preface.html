<h2 class="fm_title"><span class="bold">P<small>REFACE TO THE</small> N<small>INTH</small> E<small>DITION</small></span></h2>
<p class="indent">Twenty-five years in, for me, teaching first-year Contracts remains a joy. It is the perfect introduction to American law: There is doctrine, of course, but doctrine that evolves with the temper of the times. The cases are factually accessible to novices, but introduce them to a commercial world from which most of them have been largely sheltered thus far, having lived within households and at universities, but which, for most of them, will dominate their professional lives going forward. Contracts is a body of law embedded deep within a legal system that has shaped it and supplemented it, and which it in turn shapes and supplements, providing a window into that legal system without peer. From a skills perspective, it provides rich fodder for reading and applying both case law and statute law, drafting, counseling and advocacy. As noted in the Introduction, it has both a past and a future, and remains relevant to lawyers and clients.</p>
<p class="indent">Structurally this N<small>INTH</small> E<small>DITION</small> follows the mold of its immediate predecessors which is proven in the classroom. I begin with the thirty-thousand foot overview framed by Arthur Rosett’s brilliant introductory hypothetical <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span>, followed by an in-depth unit on contract interpretation—the major theme of the book. Then a long unit on remedies with its strong economic orientation, followed by the rest of the traditional canon. Remedies and performance issues—where all the real action is—receive the greatest emphasis.</p>
<p class="indent">The classic cases still work but I have introduced a few key new cases in some areas. Moreover, notes are updated throughout with examples, case summaries and questions that reflect the complicated, interrelated, technology-laden, diverse and evolving society we find ourselves in. One consequence of the resistance of contract doctrine to change over the last generation has been the increasing relevance of countervailing forces: The explosion in positive law regulating contractual and commercial relationships, of course, but more recently also, renewed interest in, developments in, and judicial and academic concern about, restitution and arbitration as alternatives to traditional contract remedies. Integrating the controversial T<small>HIRD</small> R<small>ESTATEMENT OF</small> R<small>ESTITUTION</small>, and the developing case law relying on unconcionability doctrine as a mechanism to regulate arbitration are the most significant doctrinal innovations reflected in this N<small>INTH</small> E<small>DITION</small>. In addition, based on feedback from adopters and students, I have included a second Appendix consisting of selected sections of the R<small>ESTATEMENT</small>, S<small>ECOND</small>, C<small>ONTRACTS</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">I am very grateful to Michael Morris-Nussbaum, UCLA School of Law Class of 2017 and Maxwell Michael, UCLA School of Law Class of 2018, for providing excellent research and editorial assistance for this N<small>INTH</small> E<small>DITION</small>. Once again, as on so many prior projects my staff assistant, Tal Grietzer, prepared a camera-ready manuscript of these materials through the miracle of modern desk-top publishing. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageiv" class="pagebreak">iv</span>His efforts, skill and care made timely publication possible. A newer member of our faculty support group, Jessica Blatchley, also played an indispensable role in preparing the manuscript for publication, and I look forward eagerly to working with her again in the future. I also owe thanks to my law partners at Klee, Tuchin, Bogdanoff &amp; Stern LLP for their indulgence and support of my academic work, and, of course, to the UCLA School of Law, its administration, its faculty, and the marvelously resourceful and helpful law librarians at the UCLA Hugh &amp; Hazel Darling Law Library. My greatest debt, however, will always be to my greatly missed friend, colleague and mentor Arthur Rosett whose mind and spirit still infuse this work.</p>
