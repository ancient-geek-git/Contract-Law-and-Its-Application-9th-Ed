<p class="indent">Contract is intimately associated with private autonomy: the idea that people should be free to order their own affairs by agreement. Private autonomy presupposes free and voluntary commitment. Some statements that appear promissory in form nonetheless are unenforceable because they are not voluntarily and intelligently made. “Promises” uttered by someone without capacity, exacted through duress, or induced by fraud or essential mistake are not deserving of respect and enforcement.</p>
<p class="indent">These tests are administered in a commonsense fashion, and without great difficulty, to decide that the promise of a woman who has a gun held to her head should not be enforced. Similarly, no one would suggest treating the promise of a four-year-old or a mental incompetent like that of a normal adult for purposes of contract law, or that the victim of a fraud must render a promised performance to the person who is bilking him. But these clear cases quickly shade off into more troublesome ones.</p>
<p class="indent">Part of the trouble lies in uncertainty over the philosophical and psychological assumptions behind our concept of assent: a faith in the human qualities of consciousness and intention, voluntariness, and free will. Modern psychology challenges these assumptions by emphasizing the ambivalence and ambiguity that marks most human behavior. People act out of unconscious motives of which they are at best imperfectly aware; they are required to act in the face of persistent and irreconcilable conflict; their apparent intention masks mixed and inconsistent desires.</p>
<p class="indent">In interpreting a contract, the judge gives it a sensible meaning in light of the background assumptions of the parties when they agreed. But the very term <span class="bold"><span class="italic">assumptions</span></span> suggests a process that is less than conscious and focused. One does not often consciously consider what one assumes.</p>
<p class="indent">Concerns about the reality of human intention are in tension with the law’s emphasis on mutual assent as an essential element of agreement. It is all very well to talk about agreement as a “meeting of the minds.” But when do such meetings occur and who serves as witness to the event? No contract of any complexity is ever complete in the sense that the parties have explicitly stated and provided for all the circumstances and eventualities that might affect its performance. Many implied terms of an agreement were not in anyone’s mind when the parties made their deal. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page366" class="pagebreak">366</span>This obvious truth casts doubt on those terms as the product of voluntary and intelligent assent. Assume the writing evidencing the agreement is silent as to the material provision (the one the parties are now fighting about) and that it is clear that the parties never consciously thought about this provision. Suppose the contract does contain a clause on the subject, but it is also clear that the parties entering the agreement weren’t paying attention. People often sign papers without reading them; all of us do so some of the time. How should the law handle these obvious non-assent situations?</p>
<p class="indent">The bases for non-enforcement discussed in this Chapter are intertwined. In some cases, particularly those that emphasize lack of capacity, there appears to be something wrong with the promisor that sets this person apart from other people and leads us to be less willing to accord the same legal weight to this person’s promises given to other people’s promises. In other cases, particularly those labeled fraud and duress, the focus is on the behavior of the promisee, rather than nature of the promisor. The promise is of questionable enforceability because the promisee did something improper to induce the promise. In a third group of cases, those tagged as “unconscionability” cases, or misunderstandings, the heart of the problem is the oppressive nature of the bargaining process and the promise itself. Yet underlying all of these cases is a concern that the values exchanged in the transaction are grossly unequal. As this inequality in substantive values exchanged increases, concern grows and we wonder why the promisor would enter into such a strange bargain. This leads us to examine critically whether the promisor was a normal adult, whether the promisee induced the peculiar deal by fraud or force, whether the bargaining was marred by fine print or incomprehensible language, or whether the whole deal was just a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that the capacity of the promisor, the behavior of the promisee, the form of the bargaining, and the substantive fairness of the deal are cumulative factors. People of limited capacity are more easily taken advantage of, particularly when the bargaining process does not bring forcefully to their attention what they are committing themselves to. Conversely, we are less concerned about lawyers who fail to read the fine print they presumably are trained to understand. Finally, note that the substantive unfairness of the bargain is an overriding concern. We do not worry too much about enforcing sensible contracts for necessities by persons of very limited capacity to contract if the price and terms of the contracts are fair.</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">Emphasis on voluntary assent as an element in contract necessarily implies that the promisor possesses the capacity to use reason. This requirement is easy enough to apply in extreme cases, as <span id="sec165" />§§ 12 and 15 of the Restatement, Second, Contracts suggest.</p>
<p class="noindent">R<small>ESTATEMENT</small>, S<small>ECOND</small>, C<small>ONTRACTS</small>:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 12. Capacity to Contract.</span></h4>
<p class="list">(1) No one can be bound by contract who has not legal capacity to incur at least voidable contractual duties. Capacity to contract may be partial and its existence in respect of a particular transaction may depend upon the nature of the transaction or upon other circumstances.</p>
<p class="list">(2) A natural person who manifests assent to a transaction has full legal capacity to incur contractual duties thereby unless he is</p>
<p class="list1">(a) under guardianship, or</p>
<p class="list1">(b) an infant, or</p>
<p class="list1">(c) mentally ill or defective, or</p>
<p class="list1">(d) intoxicated.</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 15. Mental Illness or Defect.</span></h4>
<p class="list">(1) A person incurs only voidable contractual duties by entering into a transaction if by reason of mental illness or defect</p>
<p class="list1">(a) he is unable to understand in a reasonable manner the nature and consequences of the transaction, or</p>
<p class="list1">(b) he is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and the other party has reason to know of his condition.</p>
<p class="list">(2) Where the contract is made on fair terms and the other party is without knowledge of the mental illness or defect, the power of avoidance under Subsection (1) terminates to the extent that the contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the circumstances have so changed that avoidance would be unjust. In such a case a court may grant relief as justice requires.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">As with the insanity defense in the criminal law, the traditional doctrine of mental capacity to contract fits uneasily with modern medical views of mental illness. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page368" class="pagebreak">368</span>Moreover, concepts of infancy have been modified and challenged, and the age of majority has been lowered. It is easy to state general rules in these situations. Children and people with very impaired mental functions are different and are not held to the same obligations as the rest of the community. But notice how difficult it can be to apply this sensible approach in specific cases. When you look at all but the most extreme situation in detail, you are likely to find some reason to become skeptical whether this person is so different as to be relieved of liability. After all, millions of people in the community have serious mental disabilities, tens of millions more are functionally illiterate, and many businesspersons conduct business after a liquid lunch that impairs judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">Two distinctions have been useful to courts faced with thorny questions of capacity. One distinguishes between those transactions in which the promisor is so lacking in capacity to contract that the deal is totally <span class="italic">void</span> and those which are <span class="italic">voidable</span>, that is, the disabled promisor may choose to avoid the transaction although prima facie a legal obligation is created. The second distinction is drawn between incapacities that affect a promisor’s power to enter <span class="italic">any</span> transaction and those that affect the promisor’s capacity to act reasonably with respect to a <span class="italic">particular</span> transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether the distinctions make sense or not, they allow courts to work their way through tough cases, avoiding contracts in which the agreement is unjust to the disabled party, but enforcing sensible deals by not so sensible people when the promisee has relied or partly performed to his detriment without reason to know of the promisor’s incapacity.</p>

<p id="sec166" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Ortelere v. Teachers’ Retirement Board of New York</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1969.</p>
<p class="sectionb">25 N.Y.2d 196, 303 N.Y.S.2d 362, 250 N.E.2d 460.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ B<small>REITEL</small>, J. This appeal involves the revocability of an election of benefits under a public employees’ retirement system and suggests the need for a renewed examination of the kinds of mental incompetency which may render voidable the exercise of contractual rights. The particular issue arises on the evidently unwise and foolhardy selection of benefits by a 60–year–old teacher, on leave for mental illness and suffering from cerebral arteriosclerosis, after service as a public schoolteacher and participation in a public retirement system for over 40 years. The teacher died a little less than two months after making her election of maximum benefits, payable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page369" class="pagebreak">369</span>to her during her life, thus causing the entire reserve to fall in. She left surviving her husband of 38 years of marriage and two grown children.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no doubt that any retirement system depends for its soundness on an actuarial experience based on the purely prospective selections of benefits and mortality rates among the covered group, and that retrospective or adverse selection after the fact would be destructive of a sound system. It is also true that members of retirement systems are free to make choices which to others may seem unwise or foolhardy. The issue here is narrower than any suggested by these basic principles. It is whether an otherwise irrevocable election may be avoided for incapacity because of known mental illness which resulted in the election when, except in the barest actuarial sense, the system would sustain no unfavorable consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">The husband and executor of Grace W. Ortelere, the deceased New York City schoolteacher, sues to set aside her application for retirement without option, in the event of her death. It is alleged that Mrs. Ortelere, on February 11, 1965, two months before her death from natural causes, was not mentally competent to execute a retirement application. By this application, effective the next day, she elected the maximum retirement allowance. She thus revoked her earlier election of benefits under which she named her husband a beneficiary of the unexhausted reserve upon her death. Selection of the maximum allowance extinguished all interests upon her death.</p>
<p class="indent">Following a nonjury trial in Supreme Court, it was held that Grace Ortelere had been mentally incompetent at the time of her February 11 application, thus rendering it “null and void and of no legal effect.” The Appellate Division, by a divided court, reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court and held that, as a matter of law, there was insufficient proof of mental incompetency as to this transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Ortelere’s mental illness, indeed, psychosis, is undisputed. It is not seriously disputable, however, that she had complete cognitive judgment or awareness when she made her selection. A modern understanding of mental illness, however, suggests that incapacity to contract or exercise contractual rights may exist, because of volitional and affective impediments or disruptions in the personality, despite the intellectual or cognitive ability to understand. It will be recognized as the civil law parallel to the question of criminal responsibility which has been the recent concern of so many and has resulted in statutory and decisional changes in the criminal law.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Ortelere, an elementary schoolteacher since 1924, suffered a “nervous breakdown” in March, 1964 and went on a leave of absence expiring February 5, 1965. She was then 60 years old and had been happily married for 38 years. On July 1, 1964 she came under the care of Dr. D’Angelo, a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her breakdown as involutional psychosis, melancholia type. Dr. D’Angelo prescribed, and for about six weeks decedent underwent, tranquilizer and shock therapy. Although moderately successful, the therapy was not continued since it was suspected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page370" class="pagebreak">370</span>that she also suffered from cerebral arteriosclerosis, an ailment later confirmed. However, the psychiatrist continued to see her at monthly intervals until March, 1965. On March 28, 1965 she was hospitalized after collapsing at home from an aneurysm. She died 10 days later; the cause of death was “Cerebral thrombosis due to H[ypertensive] H[eart] D[isease].”</p>
<p class="indent">As a teacher she had been a member of the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York. This entitled her to certain annuity and pension rights, preretirement death benefits, and empowered her to exercise various options concerning the payment of her retirement allowance.</p>
<p class="indent">Some years before, on June 28, 1958, she had executed a “Selection of Benefits under Option One” naming her husband as beneficiary of the unexhausted reserve. Under this option upon retirement her allowance would be less by way of periodic retirement allowances, but if she died before receipt of her full reserve the balance of the reserve would be payable to her husband. On June 16, 1960, two years later, she had designated her husband as beneficiary of her service death benefits in the event of her death prior to retirement.</p>
<p class="indent">Then on February 11, 1965, when her leave of absence had just expired and she was still under treatment, she executed a retirement application, the one here involved, selecting the maximum retirement allowance payable during her lifetime with nothing payable on or after death. She also, at this time, borrowed from the system the maximum cash withdrawal permitted, namely, $8,760. Three days earlier she had written the board, stating that she intended to retire on February 12 or 15 or as soon as she received “the information I need in order to decide whether to take an option or maximum allowance.” She then listed eight specific questions, reflecting great understanding of the retirement system, concerning the various alternatives available. An extremely detailed reply was sent, by letter of February 15, 1965, although by that date it was technically impossible for her to change her selection. However, the board’s chief clerk, before whom Mrs. Ortelere executed the application, testified that the questions were “answered verbally by me on February 11th.” Her retirement reserve totalled $62,165 (after deducting the $8,760 withdrawal), and the difference between electing the maximum retirement allowance (no option) and the allowance under “option one” was $901 per year or $75 per month. That is, had the teacher selected “option one” she would have received an annual allowance of $4,494 or $375 per month, while if no option had been selected she would have received an annual allowance of $5,395 or $450 per month. Had she not withdrawn the cash the annual figures would be $5,247 and $6,148 respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Following her taking a leave of absence for her condition, Mrs. Ortelere had become very depressed and was unable to care for herself. As a result, her husband gave up his electrician’s job, in which he earned $222 per week, to stay home and take care of her on a full-time basis. She left their home only when he accompanied <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page371" class="pagebreak">371</span>her. Although he took her to the Retirement Board on February 11, 1965, he did not know why she went, and did not question her for fear “she’d start crying hysterically that I was scolding her. That’s the way she was. And I wouldn’t upset her.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Orteleres were in quite modest circumstances. They owned their own home, valued at $20,000, and had $8,000 in a savings account. They also owned some farm land worth about $5,000. Under these circumstances, as revealed in this record, retirement for both of the Orteleres or the survivor of them had to be provided, as a practical matter, largely out of Mrs. Ortelere’s retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="indent">According to Dr. D’Angelo, the psychiatrist who treated her, Mrs. Ortelere never improved enough to “warrant my sending her back [to teaching].” A physician for the Board of Education examined her on February 2, 1965 to determine her fitness to return to teaching. Although not a psychiatrist but rather a specialist in internal medicine, this physician “judged that she had apparently recovered from the depression” and that she appeared rational. However, before allowing her to return to teaching, a report was requested from Dr. D’Angelo concerning her condition. It is notable that the Medical Division of the Board of Education on February 24, 1965 requested that Mrs. Ortelere report to the board’s “panel psychiatrist” on March 11, 1965.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. D’Angelo stated “[a]t no time since she was under my care was she ever mentally competent”; that “[m]entally she couldn’t make a decision of any kind, actually, of any kind, small or large.” He also described how involutional melancholia affects the judgment process:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">They can’t think rationally, no matter what the situation is. They will even tell you “I used to be able to think of anything and make any decision. Now,” they say, “even getting up, I don’t know whether I should get up or whether I should stay in bed.” Or, “I don’t even know how to make a slice of toast any more.” Everything is impossible to decide, and everything is too great an effort to even think of doing. They just don’t have the effort, actually, because their nervous breakdown drains them of all their physical energies.</p>
<p class="indent">While the psychiatrist used terms referring to “rationality,” it is quite evident that Mrs. Ortelere’s psychopathology did not lend itself to a classification under the legal test of irrationality. It is undoubtedly, for this reason, that the Appellate Division was unable to accept his testimony and the trial court’s finding of irrationality in the light of the prevailing rules as they have been formulated.</p>
<p class="indent">The well-established rule is that contracts of a mentally incompetent person who has not been adjudicated insane are voidable. Even where the contract has been partly or fully performed it will still be avoided upon restoration of the <span class="italic">status quo.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Traditionally, in this State and elsewhere, contractual mental capacity has been measured by what is largely a cognitive test. Under this standard the “inquiry” is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page372" class="pagebreak">372</span>whether the mind was “so affected as to render him wholly and absolutely incompetent to comprehend and understand the nature of the transaction.” A requirement that the party also be able to make a rational judgment concerning the particular transaction qualified the cognitive test. Conversely, it is also well recognized that contractual ability would be affected by insane delusions intimately related to the particular transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">These traditional standards governing competency to contract were formulated when psychiatric knowledge was quite primitive. They fail to account for one who by reason of mental illness is unable to control his conduct even though his cognitive ability seems unimpaired. When these standards were evolving it was thought that all the mental faculties were simultaneously affected by mental illness. This is no longer the prevailing view.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the greatest movement in revamping legal notions of mental responsibility has occurred in the criminal law. The nineteenth century cognitive test embraced in the <span class="italic">M’Naghten</span> rules has long been criticized and changed by statute and decision in many jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="indent">While the policy considerations for the criminal law and the civil law are different, both share in common the premise that policy considerations must be based on a sound understanding of the human mind and, therefore, its illnesses. Hence, because the cognitive rules are, for the most part, too restrictive and rest on a false factual basis they must be re-examined. Once it is understood that, accepting plaintiff’s proof, Mrs. Ortelere was psychotic and because of that psychosis could have been incapable of making a voluntary selection of her retirement system benefits, there is an issue that a modern jurisprudence should not exclude, merely because her mind could pass a “cognition” test based on nineteenth century psychology.</p>
<p class="indent">There has also been some movement on the civil law side to achieve a modern posture. For the most part, the movement has been glacial and has been disguised under traditional formulations. Various devices have been used to avoid unacceptable results under the old rules by finding unfairness or overreaching in order to avoid transactions.</p>
<p class="indent">It is quite significant that Restatement, 2d, Contracts, states the modern rule on competency to contract. This is in evident recognition, and the Reporter’s Notes support this inference, that, regardless of how the cases formulated their reasoning, the old cognitive test no longer explains the results. Thus, the new Restatement section reads: “(1) A person incurs only voidable contractual duties by entering into a transaction if by reason of mental illness or defect * * * (b) he is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and the other party has reason to know of his condition.” (Restatement, 2d, Contracts § 18.) (See, also, Allen, Ferster, Weihofen, Mental Impairment and Legal Incompetency, p. 253 [Recommendation b] and pp. 260–282; and Note, 57 Mich.L.Rev. 1020, supra, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page373" class="pagebreak">373</span>where it is recommended “that a complete test for contractual incapacity should provide protection to those persons whose contracts are merely uncontrolled reactions to their mental illness, as well as for those who could not understand the nature and consequences of their actions.”</p>
<p class="indent">The avoidance of duties under an agreement entered into by those who have done so by reason of mental illness, but who have understanding, depends on balancing competing policy considerations. There must be stability in contractual relations and protection of the expectations of parties who bargain in good faith. On the other hand, it is also desirable to protect persons who may understand the nature of the transaction but who, due to mental illness, cannot control their conduct. Hence, there should be relief only if the other party knew or was put on notice as to the contractor’s mental illness. Thus, the Restatement provision for avoidance contemplates that “the other party has reason to know” of the mental illness.</p>
<p class="indent">When, however, the other party is without knowledge of the contractor’s mental illness and the agreement is made on fair terms, the proposed Restatement rule is: “The power of avoidance under subsection (1) terminates to the extent that the contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the circumstances have so changed that avoidance would be inequitable. In such a case a court may grant relief on such equitable terms as the situation requires.”</p>
<p class="indent">The system was, or should have been, fully aware of Mrs. Ortelere’s condition. They, or the Board of Education, knew of her leave of absence for medical reasons and the resort to staff psychiatrists by the Board of Education. Hence, the other of the conditions for avoidance is satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, there are no significant changes of position by the system other than those that flow from the barest actuarial consequences of benefit selection.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor should one ignore that in the relationship between retirement system and member, and especially in a public system, there is not involved a commercial, let alone an ordinary commercial, transaction. Instead the nature of the system and its announced goal is the protection of its members and those in whom its members have an interest. It is not a sound scheme which would permit 40 years of contribution and participation in the system to be nullified by a one-instant act committed by one known to be mentally ill. This is especially true if there would be no substantial harm to the system if the act were avoided. On the record none may gainsay that her selection of a “no option” retirement while under psychiatric care, ill with cerebral arteriosclerosis, aged 60, and with a family in which she had always manifested concern, was so unwise and foolhardy that a factfinder might conclude that it was explainable only as a product of psychosis.</p>
<p class="indent">On this analysis it is not difficult to see that plaintiff’s evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that, when she acted as she did on February 11, 1965, she did so <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page374" class="pagebreak">374</span>solely as a result of serious mental illness, namely, psychosis. Of course, nothing less serious than medically classified psychosis should suffice or else few contracts would be invulnerable to some kind of psychological attack. Mrs. Ortelere’s psychiatrist testified quite flatly that as an involutional melancholiac in depression she was incapable of making a voluntary “rational” decision. Of course, as noted earlier, the trial court’s finding and perhaps some of the testimony attempted to fit into the rubrics of the traditional rules. For that reason rather than reinstatement of the judgment at Trial Term there should be a new trial under the proper standards frankly considered and applied.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the action remanded to Special Term for a new trial.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ J<small>ASEN</small>, J. (dissenting). Where there has been no previous adjudication of incompetency, the burden of proving mental incompetence is upon the party alleging it. I agree with the majority at the Appellate Division that the plaintiff, the husband of the decedent, failed to sustain the burden incumbent upon him of proving deceased’s incompetence.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence conclusively establishes that the decedent, at the time she made her application to retire, understood not only that she was retiring, but also that she had selected the maximum payment during her lifetime.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, the letter written by the deceased to the Teachers’ Retirement System prior to her retirement demonstrates her full mental capacity to understand and to decide whether to take an option or the maximum allowance. The full text of the letter reads as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">February 8, 1965</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Gentlemen:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">I would like to retire on Feb. 12 or Feb. 15. In other words, just as soon as possible after I receive the information I need in order to decide whether to take an option or maximum allowance. Following are the questions I would like to have answered:</p>
<p class="blockquote1s">1. What is my “average” five-year salary?</p>
<p class="blockquote1s">2. What is my maximum allowance?</p>
<p class="blockquote1s">3. I am 60 years old. If I select option four-a with a beneficiary (female) 27 years younger, what is my allowance?</p>
<p class="blockquote1s">4. If I select four-a on the pension part only, and take the maximum annuity, what is my allowance?</p>
<p class="blockquote1s">5. If I take a loan of 89% of my year’s salary before retirement, what would my maximum allowance be?</p>
<p class="blockquote1s">6. If I take a loan of $5,000 before retiring, and select option four-a on both the pension and annuity, what would my allowance be?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page375" class="pagebreak">375</div>
<p class="blockquote1s">7. What is my total service credit? I have been on a leave without pay since Oct. 26, 1964.</p>
<p class="blockquote1s">8. What is the “factor” used for calculating option four-a with the above beneficiary?</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">Thank you for your promptness in making the necessary calculations. I will come to your office on Thursday afternoon of this week.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems clear that this detailed, explicit and extremely pertinent list of queries reveals a mind fully in command of the salient features of the Teachers’ Retirement System. Certainly, it cannot be said that the decedent could possess sufficient capacity to compose a letter indicating such a comprehensive understanding of the retirement system, and yet lack the capacity to understand the answers.</p>
<p class="indent">As I read the record, the evidence establishes that the decedent’s election to receive maximum payments was predicated on the need for a higher income to support two retired persons—her husband and herself. Since the only source of income available to decedent and her husband was decedent’s retirement pay, the additional payment of $75 per month which she would receive by electing the maximal payment was a necessity. Indeed, the additional payments represented an increase of 20% over the benefits payable under option 1. Under these circumstances, an election of maximal income during decedent’s lifetime was not only a rational, but a necessary decision.</p>
<p class="indent">Further indication of decedent’s knowledge of the financial needs of her family is evidenced by the fact that she took a loan for the maximal amount ($8,760) permitted by the retirement system, at the time she made application for retirement.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the decedent had any warning, premonition, knowledge or indication at the time of retirement that her life expectancy was, in any way, reduced by her condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Decedent’s election of the maximum retirement benefits, therefore, was not so contrary to her best interests so as to create an inference of her mental incompetence.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, concerning election of options under a retirement system, it has been held: “Even where no previous election has been made, the court must make the election for an incompetent which would be in accordance with what would have been his manifest and reasonable choice if he were sane, and, in the absence of convincing evidence that the incompetent would have made a different selection, it is <span class="italic">presumed that he would have chosen the option yielding the largest returns in his lifetime.</span>” (<span class="italic">Schwartzberg v. Teachers’ Retirement Bd.</span>; emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="indent">Nor can I agree with the majority’s view that the traditional rules governing competency to contract “are, for the most part, too restrictive and rest on a false factual basis.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page376" class="pagebreak">376</div>
<p class="indent">The issue confronting the courts concerning mental capacity to contract is under what circumstances and conditions should a party be relieved of contractual obligations freely entered. This is peculiarly a legal decision, although, of course, available medical knowledge forms a datum which influences the legal choice. It is common knowledge that the present state of psychiatric knowledge is inadequate to provide a fixed rule for each and every type of mental disorder. Thus, the generally accepted rules which have evolved to determine mental responsibility are general enough in application to encompass all types of mental disorders, and phrased in a manner which can be understood and practically applied by juries composed of laymen.</p>
<p class="indent">The generally accepted test of mental competency to contract which has thus evolved is whether the party attempting to avoid the contract was capable of understanding and appreciating the nature and consequences of the particular act or transaction which he challenges. This rule represents a balance struck between policies to protect the security of transactions between individuals and freedom of contract on the one hand, and protection of those mentally handicapped on the other hand. In my opinion, this rule has proven workable in practice and fair in result. A broad range of evidence including psychiatric testimony is admissible under the existing rules to establish a party’s mental condition. In the final analysis, the lay jury will infer the state of the party’s mind from his observed behavior as indicated by the evidence presented at trial. Each juror instinctively judges what is normal and what is abnormal conduct from his own experience, and the generally accepted test harmonizes the competing policy considerations with human experience to achieve the fairest result in the greatest number of cases.</p>
<p class="indent">As in every situation where the law must draw a line between liability and nonliability, between responsibility and nonresponsibility, there will be borderline cases, and injustices may occur by deciding erroneously that an individual belongs on one side of the line or the other. To minimize the chances of such injustices occurring, the line should be drawn as clearly as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">The Appellate Division correctly found that the deceased was capable of understanding the nature and effect of her retirement benefits, and exercised rational judgment in electing to receive the maximum allowance during her lifetime. I fear that the majority’s refinement of the generally accepted rules will prove unworkable in practice, and make many contracts vulnerable to psychological attack. Any benefit to those who understand what they are doing, but are unable to exercise self-discipline, will be outweighed by frivolous claims which will burden our courts and undermine the security of contracts. The reasonable expectations of those who innocently deal with persons who appear rational and who understand what they are doing should be protected.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, I would affirm the order appealed from.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page377" class="pagebreak">377</div>
<p id="sec167" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Ms. Ortelere had “complete cognitive judgment or awareness” when she made her contract but suffered under “volitional or affective impediments.” But many, if not most, human acts are the products of irrational, perhaps pathological, unconscious drives. Can the legal system of contract survive if its assumptions as to the capacity for rational volitional activity are undermined?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Judge Breitel insists that “nothing less serious than medically classified psychosis should suffice [to justify invalidating a contract on the basis of mental illness] or else few contracts would be invulnerable to some kind of psychological attack.” Does this encourage too great a reliance on psychiatric diagnosis? Psychiatrists often differ on the diagnosis of particular patients and may disagree on the existence and nature of mental illness. Dr. D’Angelo, for instance, found Ms. Ortelere to be suffering from “involutional psychosis, melancholia type.” Yet the existence of such a condition, which was generally linked to menopause, is at best dubious. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association eliminated the classification of involutional melancholia from the authoritative listing of psychiatric nomenclature, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. <span class="italic">See</span> Phyllis T. Bookspan and Maxine Kline, <span class="italic">On Mirrors and Gavels: A Chronicle of How Menopause Was Used as a Legal Defense Against Women</span>, 32 I<small>ND</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 1267, 1285-86 (1999) (criticizing pre-1980 practice of diagnosing menopausal women as suffering from involutional melancholia and noting that “[m]edical professionals developed careers around the physical and emotional disorders of menopause. When called to the courtroom, their testimony was replete with scientific sounding jargon that the court frequently asked them to translate into lay terms. When this was done, the records reveal that their testimony amounted to little more than stereotyped, folkloric conclusions.”). Should psychiatry’s evolving views of Ms. Ortelere’s probable condition affect the legal decision in <span class="italic">Ortelere</span>?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. In <span class="italic">Ortelere</span> it was relatively easy for the court to give relief to the plaintiff. The defendant was a huge retirement fund to which the deceased wife of the rather poor plaintiff had contributed for forty years. By avoiding Ms. Ortelere’s election, the court restored the parties to the positions they were in before she acted. But suppose that while depressed, Ms. Ortelere contracted to paint her entire apartment a dark shade of blue. Should she be privileged to avoid the contract? If the painter had done the job, would you excuse Ms. Ortelere from paying? If the contract were not so bizarre (the purchase of a big automobile or a large life insurance policy), would you treat it differently? Do your reactions turn on her psychiatric diagnosis or on other factors?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The plaintiff in this suit is Mr. Ortelere, whose mental capacity is not in question. Recall that Mr. Ortelere drove Ms. Ortelere down to the Board of Education <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page378" class="pagebreak">378</span>that fateful day. What was he doing while his mentally ill wife was upstairs changing her retirement plan? Driving around the block in search of a parking space? Why didn’t he stop her? Why didn’t he warn the Board of Education? Should he now be allowed to avoid the consequences of his failure to prevent his wife from acting improvidently?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. After the Board becomes aware of Ms. Ortelere’s psychiatric condition, should they refuse to honor any election she makes even though she is not under any form of legal guardianship? Can they?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Suppose that the evidence at trial disclosed that the Orteleres had fought for 42 years and, as the letter quoted in the dissenting opinion perhaps suggests, she specifically intended to “cut him off” in favor of their daughter. Would it matter on those facts that she suffered from involutional psychosis, melancholia type?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">7</span>. Some evidence in the record below suggested that Ms. Ortelere had recovered from her nervous breakdown. Recall that Ms. Ortelere retired only after her disability leave was terminated. She had been examined by a Board of Education physician who found that she had fully recovered and was able to resume her duties. This physician testified that Ms. Ortelere’s “depression and nervousness followed a heart attack had by her husband and his large losses in the stock market” and that “she had shaken off her worries concerning the stocks” and “felt that she could return to [teaching] without any trouble.” He went on to relate that she said that “she had had her house redecorated, that she shopped, that she had been seeing friends and playing cards, that she went and visited her daughter and her grandchildren, and that she had done some painting of pictures.” Ms. Ortelere was “quite alert, by which I would mean that she answered my questions … without any hesitation, and that she did not contradict herself. She didn’t appear at all depressed. Neither did she appear euphoric—with her head in the clouds. She didn’t claim that everything was perfect.” Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals ignored this testimony. But who seems more credible to you: the Board of Education physician or Dr. D’Angelo? And if the psychiatrists disagree about the existence and extent of her depression, what basis is there for finding that the now-deceased Ms. Ortelere lacked mental capacity to contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">8</span>. Suppose that Ms. Ortelere did not die soon after retirement but that at age 98 she was still going strong. Should the pension fund be able to discontinue payments at the maximum allowance rate on the ground that she lacked mental capacity at the time she made her election?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">9</span>. If you represented the Board of Education <span class="italic">during</span> this litigation, what story would you try to tell a trier of fact? What circumstantial evidence would you be interested in learning about?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page379" class="pagebreak">379</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">10</span>. If you represented the Board of Education <span class="italic">after</span> the litigation, what procedures would you recommend to avoid future disputes with the Mr. Orteleres of this world? Would the recommended procedures be something that you would have wanted to include, in some fashion or another, in your story to the trier of fact?</p>

<p id="sec168" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON THE LEGAL CAPACITY OF NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING AND ILLITERATE PERSONS</span></p>
<p class="indent">According to the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy, approximately 30 million adult Americans, 14% of the adult population, lack basic English language literacy skills. Those adults could not read and understand information in short commonplace prose texts or simple documents. An additional 50-60 million American adults lack the skills necessary to perform moderately challenging literacy activities. Only 13% of American adults were assessed as “proficient” in literacy skills. In light of this problem, should the rules of contract law be modified? Do all these people have limited legal capacity to make enforceable agreements?</p>
<p class="indent">Traditionally, the answer has been that an inability to read and write in English is not a legal disability for purposes of contract law. Absent fraud or other overreaching by their counterparties, those not literate in English are nevertheless bound by the terms of the written English-language contracts they manifest assent to. It is the responsibility (say the courts) of those not literate in English to have written agreements read to them or explained to them if they do not wish to be bound by terms that they are not aware of. Indeed, given the vast numbers of people with limited English language ability who have always lived and worked in the United States, the rule could hardly be otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Morales v. Sun Constructors</span>, 541 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2008), the court stated that “[i]n the absence of fraud, the fact that an offeree cannot read, write, speak, or understand the English language is immaterial to whether an English-language agreement the offeree executes is enforceable.” <span class="italic">See also Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Lang</span>, 321 F.3d 533, 538 (5th Cir. 2003) (holding that since “[i]t is a widely accepted principle of contracts that one who signs or accepts a written instrument will normally be bound in accordance with its written terms,” the defendant, “illiterate or not, would be bound” by the agreement); <span class="italic">Scrutu v. Int’l Student Exch.</span>, 523 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1320 (S.D. Ala. 2007) (“[A] person who signs an instrument despite an inability to read cannot avoid the effect of his signature if he has neither asked to have the instrument read nor inquired as to its contents.”); <span class="italic">Golden State Trading v. Wayne Electro Sys.</span>, 889 N.Y.S.2d 72 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009) (holding that the plaintiff company “may not rely on its president’s inability to speak English to invalidate the contracts”); <span class="italic">Holcomb v. TWR Express</span>, 782 N.Y.S.2d 840, (N.Y. App. Div. 2004) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page380" class="pagebreak">380</span>(“‘A party who executes a contract is presumed to know its contents and to assent to them.’ An inability to understand the English language, without more, is insufficient to avoid this general rule. A person who is illiterate in the English language is not automatically excused from complying with the terms of a contract simply because he or she could not read it.”); <span class="italic">Mason v. Acceptance Loan Co.</span>, 850 So.2d 289 (Ala. 2002) (“Conditions such as illiteracy and a lack of education do not make one ‘insane’ or otherwise deprive one of the ability to contract.”).</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, in many circumstances, it will be infeasible for someone illiterate in English to have a document read to him or translated before he signs it. Illiteracy in English is a significant handicap in our society, but an inability to enter into a binding contract is only likely to make matters worse for illiterate persons.</p>
<p class="indent">More broadly, we are all in some sense functionally illiterate given the practical realities of modern life and the complexity of modern contracts. We all constantly face situations where we execute contracts we have not read and the specific provisions of which we have only limited, or no, awareness. There may be good reasons to enforce the terms of such contracts as written even in the absence of any real assent. On the other hand, in some cases there may be good reasons to challenge contract law’s casual assumption that execution of a writing is a sufficient basis to bind the parties to all its terms notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of a complete lack of understanding of those terms by one or both parties.</p>

<p id="sec170" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">S.P. Dunham &amp; Co. v. Kudra</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, 1957.</p>
<p class="sectionb">44 N.J.Super. 565, 131 A.2d 306.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ C<small>LAPP</small>, S.J.A.D. Plaintiff, S.P. Dunham &amp; Company, sued defendants for the restitution of $3,232.55 paid them allegedly under business compulsion. The trial court, sitting without a jury, gave judgment for the plaintiff in the amount stated. Defendants appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff has for over a century operated a department store in Trenton. For some three years it had leased its fur department to a concessionaire, Elmer A. Hurwitz &amp; Co., but the business of the department was so conducted as to appear to customers to have been a part of plaintiff’s operations. During these three years fur <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page381" class="pagebreak">381</span>coats, left by customers with Hurwitz for storage and cleaning were turned over by him to the defendants Kudra who stored and cleaned them pursuant to an agreement with Hurwitz. Plaintiff knew something of Hurwitz’ arrangement with Kudra.</p>
<p class="indent">In November 1955 Hurwitz went bankrupt and Dunham thereupon cancelled his concession. However, winter was coming on, and Dunham’s customers wanted their coats. On November 23, 1955 Kudra had possession of 412 garments, on which Hurwitz owed Kudra $622.50. This sum plaintiff offered to pay Kudra in return for the garments. But Hurwitz owed Kudra an additional $3,232.55 with respect to other garments that had been delivered back to customers during the preceding two years; and on November 23, Kudra announced that the 412 coats would not be turned over unless plaintiff paid the total sum of $3,855.05. One of the owners of Dunham, much upset, asked Kudra for a few days to think the matter over and consult with counsel. Apparently at about that time, the temperature had dropped to 15 degrees; many substantial customers of the store demanded their coats. When both owners of Dunham then sought to negotiate further, Kudra came up with the proposition that it would deliver the garments directly to plaintiff’s customers without charge to the plaintiff, if plaintiff would turn over their names; not only would plaintiff thus place the names of customers in the hands of a competitor in the fur business, but Kudra apparently proposed to bill them directly for Hurwitz’ total charges on the coats, which totalled some $4,000. Plaintiff flatly rejected this proposition and on November 29 yielded to Kudra’s original demand, paying the $3,855.05. Allegedly, three days later it sought the return of $3,232.55 and on December 15 commenced this action.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff seeks the restitution of the $3,232.55 on the ground that the money was paid to defendants, not voluntarily, but under a species of duress, sometimes known as “business compulsion.” It claims that defendants, taking advantage of its plight, sought to squeeze it between their own improper demands and the complaints of its customers. Indeed, the predicament in which it was placed was so embarrassing a matter that one of the owners of the store, apprehensive of a serious impairment in its good will, himself spent hours in the fur department talking to customers. There is little doubt but that the pressure which defendants brought to bear upon the plaintiff was an inducing, indeed the sole cause of its payment of the $3,232.55.</p>
<p class="indent">A slight examination of the subject will demonstrate that the law of duress is in the process of development. 5 Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed. 1937), § 1603; Dawson, “Economic Duress—An Essay in Perspective,” 45 Mich.L.Rev. 253 (1947); Dalzell, “Duress by Economic Pressure,” 20 No.Car.L.Rev. 237, 341 (1942). Thus in New Jersey, after some conflicting decisions on the point, our courts have finally rejected the objective test, namely, that duress is irremediable unless it is of such severity as to overcome the will of a person of ordinary firmness; the test now is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page382" class="pagebreak">382</span>simply this—has the person complaining been constrained to do what he otherwise would not have done?</p>
<p class="indent">Apropos of this, attention may be directed to a point brought up by the respondent. It has repeatedly been held in our cases that a person cannot claim to have made a payment under duress if, before he made the payment, there was available to him an immediate and adequate remedy in the courts to test or resist it. This harsh rule has been rejected by the Restatement, Contracts, § 493, Illustrations 8, 9, and also by Williston. Williston points out that:</p>
<p class="blockquote">the only reason which could be given for such a rule is that a threat of this sort should not terrify a person of “ordinary firmness.” But, though such statements are still repeated, the rule is artificial and, so far as it would require a person threatened with injury necessarily to endure the injury because the law provides a remedy for it, cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that New Jersey in <span class="italic">Rubenstein v. Rubenstein</span> has definitely repudiated the standard of “ordinary firmness,” there may be little reason to retain the other rule; the criterion perhaps should be solely whether the will of the victim was really overborne. An attempt has been made to justify the rule stated, upon the ground that the person exerting the duress has relied on the payment made to him by the victim, and having relied, he should be protected. But why should the law have such a tender regard for a wrongdoer? Relief by way of restitution puts no undue burden upon him; he is not subjected to damages for his wrong, but merely called upon to give back that which he forced from his victim. The court granting restitution should have an easy conscience in the matter.</p>
<p class="indent">However, we need not pass upon this more fundamental question. If we accept the rule as stated in our cases, we must still ask ourselves whether the plaintiff had a “complete and adequate remedy” enabling it to recover the coats for its customers and avoid the payment of the $3,232.55. Or did it have merely a “questionable” or uncertain remedy? Redress by way of replevin was suggested on the oral argument. But plaintiff, by way of reply, said first that it was questionable whether it had the standing to maintain an action of replevin, since the owners of the coats had delivered them to Hurwitz and Hurwitz in turn had handed them over to defendants pursuant to his agreement with them; in fact, defendants say in their brief that “Dunham had no control over the return of these coats by Kudra.” We pass the question as to whether plaintiff had the standing to maintain the action. And we may also pass the second question raised by plaintiff in that regard, namely, whether the remedy in replevin was entirely adequate in view of Kudra’s right to prevent the delivery of the goods by putting up a redelivery bond. It might be said in this latter connection that the action on such a bond “‘would not have afforded the plaintiff the relief to which he was entitled, the immediate possession of his property; he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page383" class="pagebreak">383</span>would have been compelled to exchange [the] property for a right of action against these defendants’” on the redelivery bond.</p>
<p class="indent">Passing those two questions, we come to plaintiff’s third contention, namely, that there was no adequate remedy here through any form of litigation. Plaintiff, faced with the clamoring demands of its customers, plainly did not want it brought home to each of them at that juncture that its competitors, the defendants, were in fact attending to the storing and cleaning of her coat. We think a public suit at that time did not constitute adequate relief.</p>
<p class="indent">We turn now to defendants’ principal argument, which seems to be that they should not be chargeable by plaintiff with “the duress * * * it itself had long ago prepared.” They rely on the fact that plaintiff for three years during the summer months had lent Hurwitz money “in the neighborhood of $2,000, $1,500”; and they claim that, though these amounts were paid back in September each year, plaintiff should have known of Hurwitz’ financial difficulties. The argument seems to be that plaintiff itself caused defendants to exert the duress. The point is without the slightest substance.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, defendants seem to argue, referring to the early common-law doctrine of “duress of goods,” that under our present concepts of “business compulsion” redress could be had by the plaintiff here only if it had been compelled to pay out money in order to recover its own property. There is nothing to this point either. The law today does not take such a narrow view of the matter, if indeed it ever did.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, defendants contend that the plaintiff cannot have been under duress since, for six days, it had an opportunity to deliberate and consult with its own counsel. These are matters which should be taken into account in determining whether in fact the plaintiff made the payment voluntarily and whether the pressure of defendants’ demands still subsisted after deliberation and consultation; but they do not of themselves preclude relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Again it is urged that one person (Dunham) cannot claim to have been placed under duress if he pays money to the defendants for the relief of another person (i.e., its customers). We need not refer to the law on the subject, because it is apparent that Dunham paid the $3,232.55 for the relief of itself from an injury to its own good will.</p>
<p class="indent">… [W]e might refer to the trial court’s concluding remarks below: “it (defendant’s conduct) is one of the things I prefer not to * * * have to live with in the community. I couldn’t justify it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page384" class="pagebreak">384</div>
<p id="sec171" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Was S.P. Dunham &amp; Co. under duress in the same sense as a man who makes an agreement with a gun against his head? If the market supply of nuts and bolts needed by a manufacturer for production is short and it agrees to pay a 30% bonus to get what it needs, may it later resist an action for the price because of duress?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. To what extent does the term duress describe the necessity or the availability of choice to one party, rather than the moral repugnance of the conduct used by another party? Did Dunham recover in this case because it didn’t consent to the contract as a result of duress, or did it recover because Kudra’s behavior is one of the things the judge would “prefer not to * * * have to live with in the community”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Kudra’s claim appears to be without legal foundation, that is, Dunham was clearly not liable for the amount Hurwitz owed Kudra on the other coats. Suppose Kudra did have a valid claim but enforced it by very tough tactics, threats, and withholding the coats. Wouldn’t Dunham be just as subject to duress and have just as little choice whether to comply? Would the result in a suit by Dunham to recover the money it paid under duress be the same?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Peter is wrongfully arrested by the police, who have confused him with another person with a similar name. He is held in a cell for 18 hours and then released only after he signs a form that releases any civil claim he may have for false arrest against the police. Is the release enforceable in a later suit Peter brings against the police?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. May a lawyer threaten to refer a matter to criminal prosecution unless the potential defendant pays a claim asserted by the lawyer’s client? May a lawyer threaten to turn an adverse party in to Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless the adverse party drops his suit? Consider Cal. R. Prof. Conduct 5–100(a):</p>

<p id="sec172" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Selmer Co. v. Blakeslee–Midwest Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1983.</p>
<p class="sectionb">704 F.2d 924.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>OSNER</small>, J. This appeal by the plaintiff from summary judgment for the defendants in a diversity case requires us to consider the meaning, under Wisconsin contract law, of “economic duress” as a defense to a settlement of a contract dispute.</p>
<p class="indent">On this appeal, we must take as true the following facts. The plaintiff, Selmer, agreed to act as a subcontractor on a construction project for which the defendant Blakeslee–Midwest Prestressed Concrete Company was the general contractor. Under the contract between Blakeslee–Midwest and Selmer, Selmer was to receive $210,000 for erecting prestressed concrete materials supplied to it by Blakeslee–Midwest. Blakeslee–Midwest failed to fulfill its contractual obligations; among other things, it was tardy in supplying Selmer with the prestressed concrete materials. Selmer could have terminated the contract without penalty but instead agreed orally with Blakeslee–Midwest to complete its work, provided Blakeslee–Midwest would pay Selmer for the extra costs of completion due to Blakeslee–Midwest’s defaults. When the job was completed, Selmer demanded payment of $120,000. Blakeslee–Midwest offered $67,000 and refused to budge from this offer. Selmer, because it was in desperate financial straits, accepted the offer.</p>
<p class="indent">Two and a half years later Selmer brought this suit against Blakeslee–Midwest (the other defendants’ liability, being derivative from Blakeslee–Midwest’s, does not require separate consideration), claiming that its extra costs had amounted to $150,000 ($120,000 being merely a settlement offer), and asking for that amount minus the $67,000 it had received, plus consequential and punitive damages. Although Selmer, presumably in order to be able to claim such damages, describes this as a tort rather than a contract action, it seems really to be a suit on Blakeslee–Midwest’s alleged oral promise to reimburse Selmer in full for the extra costs of completing the original contract after Blakeslee–Midwest defaulted. But the characterization is unimportant. Selmer concedes that, whatever its suit is, it is barred by the settlement agreement if, as the district court held, that agreement is valid. The only question is whether there is a triable issue as to whether the settlement agreement is invalid because procured by “economic duress.”</p>
<p class="indent">If you extract a promise by means of a threat, the promise is unenforceable. This is not, as so often stated, because such a promise is involuntary, unless “involuntary” is a conclusion rather than the description of a mental state. If the threat is ferocious (“your money or your life”) and believed, the victim may be desperately eager to fend it off with a promise. Such promises are made unenforceable in order to discourage threats by making them less profitable. The fundamental issue in a duress case is therefore not the victim’s state of mind but whether the statement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page386" class="pagebreak">386</span>that induced the promise is the kind of offer to deal that we want to discourage, and hence that we call a “threat.” Selmer argues that Blakeslee–Midwest said to it in effect, “give up $53,000 of your claim for extras [$120,000 minus $67,000], or you will get nothing.” This has the verbal form of a threat but is easily recast as a promise innocuous on its face—“I promise to pay you $67,000 for a release of your claim.” There is a practical argument against treating such a statement as a threat: it will make an inference of duress inescapable in any negotiation where one party makes an offer from which it refuses to budge, for the other party will always be able to argue that he settled only because there was a (figurative) gun at his head. It would not matter whether the party refusing to budge was the payor like Blakeslee–Midwest or the promisor like Selmer. If Selmer had refused to complete the job without being paid exorbitantly for the extras and Blakeslee–Midwest had complied with this demand because financial catastrophe would have loomed if Selmer had walked off the job, we would have the same case. A vast number of contract settlements would be subject to being ripped open upon an allegation of duress if Selmer’s argument were accepted.</p>
<p class="indent">Sensitive—maybe oversensitive—to this danger, the older cases held that a threat not to honor a contract could not be considered duress. But the principle was not absolute, as is shown by <span class="italic">Alaska Packers’ Ass’n v. Domenico</span>, 117 Fed. 99 (9th Cir.1902). Sailors and fishermen (the libelants) “agreed in writing, for a certain stated compensation, to render their services to the appellant in remote waters where the season for conducting fishing operations is extremely short, and in which enterprise the appellant had a large amount of money invested; and, after having entered upon the discharge of their contract, and at a time when it was impossible for the appellant to secure other men in their places, the libelants, without any valid cause, absolutely refused to continue the services they were under contract to perform unless the appellant would consent to pay them more money.” The appellant agreed, but later reneged, and the libelants sued. They lost; the court refused to enforce the new agreement. Although the technical ground of decision was the absence of fresh consideration for the modified agreement, it seems apparent both from the quoted language and from a reference on the same page to coercion that the court’s underlying concern was that the modified agreement had been procured by duress in the form of the threat to break the original contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Alaska Packers’ Ass’n</span> shows that because the legal remedies for breach of contract are not always adequate, a refusal to honor a contract may force the other party to the contract to surrender his rights—in <span class="italic">Alaska Packers’ Ass’n,</span> the appellant’s right to the libelants’ labor at the agreed wage. It undermines the institution of contract to allow a contract party to use the threat of breach to get the contract modified in his favor not because anything has happened to require modification in the mutual interest of the parties but simply because the other party, unless he knuckles under <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page387" class="pagebreak">387</span>to the threat, will incur costs for which he will have no adequate legal remedy. If contractual protections are illusory, people will be reluctant to make contracts. Allowing contract modifications to be voided in circumstances such as those in <span class="italic">Alaska Packers’ Ass’n</span> assures prospective contract parties that signing a contract is not stepping into a trap, and by thus encouraging people to make contracts promotes the efficient allocation of resources.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Capps v. Georgia Pac. Corp.</span>, 253 Or. 248 (1969), illustrates the principle of <span class="italic">Alaska Packers’ Ass’n</span> in the context of settling contract disputes. The defendant promised to give the plaintiff, as a commission for finding a suitable lessee for a piece of real estate, 5 percent of the total rental plus one half of the first month’s rent. The plaintiff found a suitable lessee and the lease was signed. Under the terms of the commission arrangement the defendant owed the plaintiff $157,000, but he paid only $5,000, and got a release from the plaintiff of the rest. The plaintiff later sued for the balance of the $157,000, alleging that when requesting payment of the agreed-upon commission he had “informed Defendant that due to Plaintiff’s adverse financial condition, he was in danger of immediately losing other personal property through repossession and foreclosure unless funds from Defendant were immediately made available for the purpose of paying these creditors.” But “Defendant, through its agent * * *, advised Plaintiff that though he was entitled to the sums demanded in Plaintiff’s Complaint, unless he signed the purported release set forth in Defendant’s Answer, Plaintiff would receive no part thereof, inasmuch as Defendant had extensive resources and powerful and brilliant attorneys who would and could prevent Plaintiff in any subsequent legal proceeding from obtaining payment of all or any portion of said sums.” We can disregard the reference to the defendant’s “powerful and brilliant attorneys” yet agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that the confluence of the plaintiff’s necessitous financial condition, the defendant’s acknowledged indebtedness for the full $157,000, and the settlement of the indebtedness for less than 3 cents on the dollar—with no suggestion that the defendant did not have the money to pay the debt in full—showed duress. The case did not involve the settlement of a genuine dispute, but, as in <span class="italic">Alaska Packers’ Ass’n,</span> an attempt to exploit the contract promisee’s lack of an adequate legal remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">Although <span class="italic">Capps</span> is not a Wisconsin case, we have no reason to think that Wisconsin courts would reach a different result. But the only feature that the present case shares with <span class="italic">Capps</span> is that the plaintiff was in financial difficulties. Since Blakeslee–Midwest did not acknowledge that it owed Selmer $120,000, and since the settlement exceeded 50 percent of Selmer’s demand, the terms of the settlement are not unreasonable on their face, as in <span class="italic">Capps.</span> Thus the question is starkly posed whether financial difficulty can by itself justify setting aside a settlement on grounds of duress. It cannot. “The mere stress of business conditions will not constitute duress where the defendant was not responsible for the conditions.” The adverse <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page388" class="pagebreak">388</span>effect on the finality of settlements and hence on the willingness of parties to settle their contract disputes without litigation would be great if the cash needs of one party were alone enough to entitle him to a trial on the validity of the settlement. In particular, people who desperately wanted to settle for cash—who simply could not afford to litigate—would be unable to settle, because they could not enter into a <span class="italic">binding</span> settlement; being desperate, they could always get it set aside later on grounds of duress. It is a detriment, not a benefit, to one’s long-run interests not to be able to make a binding commitment.</p>
<p class="indent">Matters stand differently when the complaining party’s financial distress is due to the other party’s conduct. Although Selmer claims that it was the extra expense caused by Blakeslee–Midwest’s breaches of the original contract that put it in a financial vise, it could have walked away from the contract without loss or penalty when Blakeslee–Midwest broke the contract. Selmer was not forced by its contract to remain on the job, and was not prevented by circumstances from walking away from the contract, as the appellant in <span class="italic">Alaska Packers’ Ass’n</span> had been; it stayed on the job for extra pay. We do not know why Selmer was unable to weather the crisis that arose when Blakeslee–Midwest refused to pay $120,000 for Selmer’s extra expenses—whether Selmer was undercapitalized or overborrowed or what—but Blakeslee–Midwest cannot be held responsible for whatever it was that made Selmer so necessitous, when, as we have said, Selmer need not have embarked on the extended contract.</p>
<p class="indent">To assimilate this case to one of the conventional categories of duress Selmer argues that Blakeslee–Midwest withheld $21,000 in “retainage” in order to force Selmer to settle the dispute over the extras, and in thus withholding Selmer’s property was guilty of “duress of goods,” rather than merely of a refusal to settle a contract dispute. Many construction contracts, including this one, allow the payor to retain 10 percent of any advance payments due under the contract as security for the contractor’s completing the job. At the completion of the job the amount retained must of course be paid the contractor. To have held the retainage back with no justification at all, merely to force Selmer to yield on its dispute over the extras, might well have been duress, since Blakeslee–Midwest is alleged to have known of Selmer’s desperate circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">The precise allegation concerning retainage, however, is that Blakeslee–Midwest’s take-it-or-leave-it offer of $67,000 included the retainage of $21,000. Since the retainage was 10 percent of the contract price, Selmer must have received 90 percent of the price, or $189,000, and that plus $67,000 would equal $256,000. But Selmer in fact received a total of $280,000 from Blakeslee–Midwest. As this must have included the retainage, the retainage allegation was discredited and so did not create a triable issue. It might of course have been duress for Blakeslee–Midwest to say to Selmer, “we will give you your retainage of $21,000 plus $67,000 if and only <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page389" class="pagebreak">389</span>if you abandon your claim for any additional extra payments,” but that is not Selmer’s contention. It says it was offered $67,000 including the retainage—not that it was offered $88,000—and this is inconsistent with the uncontradicted evidence that the entire contract price of $210,000 was paid plus the $67,000 in extras. Moreover, Selmer waived its subcontractor’s lien, indicating it had been paid in full. This waiver, incidentally, was signed after Selmer received the $67,000 it claims to have accepted under duress. This is additional evidence that Selmer was not acting under duress when it made the settlement that years later it tried to repudiate.</p>

<p id="sec174" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Andreini v. Hultgren</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Utah Supreme Court, 1993.</p>
<p class="sectionb">860 P.2d 916.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ Z<small>IMMERMAN</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">On May 5, 1987, Andreini entered Holy Cross Hospital and underwent surgery on his right knee. Dr. R. David Beck, an orthopedic surgeon, performed the operation. He was assisted by Dr. Bruce Hultgren, an anesthesiologist, and several nurses employed by Holy Cross. On May 6, 1987, while still in the hospital, Andreini noticed a “pins and needles” sensation in both hands. While it is unclear from the record exactly when he noticed additional symptoms, by May 19, 1987, the date of discharge, Andreini exhibited noticeable atrophy of both hands. His discharge summary indicated that he had sustained a bilateral ulnar neuropathy, a deterioration of the nerves extending from his arms into both hands. However, the discharge summary did not suggest a cause. Andreini contends that none of the doctors or nurses made this diagnosis known to him prior to his discharge, and that, when he became aware of the diagnosis during his discharge, no one offered an explanation as to its meaning. Andreini claims that Beck told him his condition was probably the result of lying in bed or that it could be due to “heredity” or his “physical structure.”</p>
<p class="indent">On July 2, 1987, Andreini visited Dr. Nathaniel M. Nord, who informed him that he had suffered a compression paralysis of both hands. Nord, however, did not express an opinion as to the cause. After Nord reported his findings to Beck, Beck suggested to Andreini that a second surgery be performed to correct the condition. Beck said that he would ask the hospital to waive its charges for the corrective surgery and that he would allow Andreini to make payments to cover his fee. The surgery was scheduled for July 9, 1987.</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately one week before the scheduled operation, a nurse apparently not associated with defendants told Andreini that the compression paralysis in his hands might have resulted from the improper strapping of his wrists during surgery. Andreini claims this was the first time he became aware that improper strapping was a possible cause of his injury.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page391" class="pagebreak">391</div>
<p class="indent">On July 9th, Andreini arrived at Holy Cross Hospital and was prepared for surgery. At some point between one-half to one hour before surgery was to begin, a Holy Cross employee presented Andreini with a release form and asked him to sign it. Andreini refused. The employee then arranged to have Beck talk to Andreini by phone. Beck told Andreini that he would not perform the surgery unless Andreini released both him and Holy Cross from future liability. Although visibly upset, Andreini signed the form and underwent the operation. The procedure was unsuccessful. Andreini has lost most of the dexterity in his hands and cannot perform any activity that requires grasping or holding.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to the claims against Beck and Holy Cross, the court found that Andreini had released both parties from liability and, as a matter of law, had not signed the form under duress. Andreini now appeals.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, we address Andreini’s contention that the trial court erred when it dismissed his complaint against Beck and Holy Cross. The trial court reasoned that “the release executed by the plaintiff on July 9, 1987 released any of plaintiff’s claims that he may have then had or thereafter had against Dr. Beck, the Holy Cross Hospital and its personnel.” Andreini admits to signing the release form but claims that he did so under duress and therefore is not bound by its terms. He argues that he has adduced sufficient facts to entitle him to take this issue to the jury.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to the legal standard for duress, the parties direct us to two Utah cases, <span class="italic">Heglar Ranch, Inc. v. Stillman</span> and <span class="italic">Fox v. Piercey</span> (1951), and to sections 175 and 176 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. The court order granting summary judgment against Holy Cross and Beck similarly relies on concepts from both of these cases and the Second Restatement. However, the <span class="italic">Heglar-Fox</span> standard for duress differs significantly from the Second Restatement standard, and the parties’ arguments before this court reveal considerable confusion as to the appropriate legal standard for determining duress. Therefore, we take this occasion to review the law in this area and to clarify the legal standard to be applied in Utah.</p>
<p class="indent">Our 1951 decision in <span class="italic">Fox</span> was the first Utah case to discuss extensively the legal concept of duress. In that case, after tracing the evolution of the common law standard for duress, we adopted the then “modern rule,” which was essentially the rather general rule articulated in the Restatement (First) of Contracts. Under that view, to invalidate a contract for duress, the alleged victim must show that the perpetrator committed “a wrongful act or threat which actually puts the victim in such fear as to compel him to act against his will.” In <span class="italic">Heglar</span>, decided in 1980, we quoted this formulation of the duress standard from <span class="italic">Fox</span> and used it to resolve the issue then before us. However, we did not examine the vitality of that articulation of duress or its underlying concepts.</p>
<p class="indent">Two years later, in <span class="italic">Horgan v. Industrial Design Corp</span>., we said that the <span class="italic">Heglar-Fox</span> formulation is “not a rigid rule based on precise elements that must be satisfied in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page392" class="pagebreak">392</span>every case,” but rather is “a general definition to be applied flexibly to the distinct facts of each case.” We noted that the law of duress had since broadened, which made it difficult to arrive at a clear-cut definition of duress. Nonetheless, we held that a critical factor in determining whether an alleged victim had suffered duress was whether he or she “had no other viable alternative.”</p>
<p class="indent">Between our decisions in <span class="italic">Fox</span> and <span class="italic">Horgan</span>, the Restatement drafters largely abandoned the First Restatement’s formulation of duress that we had adopted in <span class="italic">Fox</span> and followed in <span class="italic">Heglar</span> because the formulation was too general to be of much guidance to courts and parties. The drafters articulated a new test that, among other things, divided the “wrongful act” requirement into two distinct parts: duress by physical compulsion and duress by improper threat. The drafters defined the latter by adopting carefully crafted legal elements drawn from the case law of many courts. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 174–76 (1979). The drafters omitted the requirement that the perpetrator’s actions “must arouse such fear as precludes a party from exercising free will and judgment” because “of its vagueness and impracticality.” Id. § 175 cmt. b. They reasoned, “It is enough if the threat actually induces assent * * * on the part of one who has no reasonable alternative.”</p>
<p class="indent">We agree with this reasoning and explicitly adopt the legal standards of duress set forth in sections 175 and 176 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. Our decision today is not as much a break with the past as a clarification that the Utah law of duress accords with the now prevalent view. In <span class="italic">Horgan</span>, we distanced ourselves from <span class="italic">Fox’s</span> formulation and in that case, moved toward the Second Restatement position. We note that the results reached in <span class="italic">Fox</span> and <span class="italic">Heglar</span> would have been the same under the Second Restatement formulation.</p>
<p class="indent">For the purposes of the instant case, we consider only those sections of the Restatement necessary to determine whether the trial court erred in finding no question of material fact as to whether Andreini signed the release under duress. Section 175(1) states that a contract may be voided “[i]f a party’s manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative.” Section 176 sets forth when a threat is “improper”:</p>
<p class="list">(1) A threat is improper if</p>
<p class="list1">(d) the threat is a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing under a contract with the recipient.</p>
<p class="list">(2) A threat is improper if the resulting exchange is not on fair terms, and</p>
<p class="list1">(b) the effectiveness of the threat in inducing the manifestation of assent is significantly increased by prior unfair dealing by the party making the threat….</p>
<p class="indent">Andreini argues that he has put into issue sufficient material facts to raise a jury question as to whether Beck’s threat not to perform the corrective surgery was a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page393" class="pagebreak">393</span>breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and therefore constituted an improper threat. He also argues that he has raised a jury question as to whether he had any reasonable alternatives to signing the release. By making these arguments, Andreini hopes to meet the requirements established in sections 175(1) and 176(1)(d) of the Restatement, which would allow him to void the release.</p>
<p class="indent">We first consider if Andreini adduced sufficient material facts as to whether defendants made an improper threat by breaching the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Under section 176(1)(d) of the Restatement, the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing must be “under a contract with the recipient.” Therefore, to find a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, there must be some type of preexisting contractual relationship. This is consistent with our case law. Andreini, however, does not explicitly allege that he and defendants entered into a contract before he was presented with and later signed the release. Consequently, Andreini may not rely on an alleged breach of good faith and fair dealing to claim duress for the first time on appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">However, Andreini does make an argument that, fairly construed, appears to constitute an improper threat under section 176(2)(b) of the Restatement. Under this provision, an improper threat may be found when (i) “the resulting exchange is not on fair terms,” and (ii) “the effectiveness of the threat in inducing the manifestation of assent is significantly increased by prior unfair dealing by the party making the threat.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 176(2)(b) (1979). Andreini argues that Beck improperly induced him into signing the release by promising that the corrective surgery would fully restore the use of his hands. He avers that prior to entering the hospital for the corrective surgery, Beck told him that patients with similar injuries had recovered 50% use within two weeks and 100% use within two months as a result of surgery similar to that proposed. Andreini also points to language in the release itself suggesting full recovery: “I, EUGENE R. ANDREINI, will receive surgery to correct ulnar nerve palsy * * *.” This evidence is sufficient to establish the legal possibility that the “resulting exchange”—defendants’ unfulfilled promise to correct Andreini’s injury exchanged for Andreini’s release of all claims against defendants—is “not on fair terms” within the meaning of section 176(2) of the Restatement.</p>
<p class="indent">However, to avoid summary judgment under section 176(2)(b)’s formulation of an “improper threat,” there must also be sufficient evidence to raise a factual issue as to whether defendants had engaged in unfair dealing and whether this significantly increased the impropriety of their threat. Andreini argues that defendants acted in bad faith by promising him that the corrective surgery would result in his full recovery while neglecting to inform him until just prior to surgery that he would have to waive any claims he might have against them.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page394" class="pagebreak">394</div>
<p class="indent">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Andreini, there is sufficient evidence to take this argument to the jury. We have already recited the evidence suggesting that defendants promised Andreini full recovery, and in Andreini’s deposition, he testifies that he was not told until after he had been placed in a gown, shaved, and prepared for surgery that he would have to relinquish his rights. Andreini also testified that defendants were purposely noncommittal about the paralysis in his hands and its possible causes, even after Dr. Nord diagnosed his condition as compression paralysis. Moreover, Andreini averred that when he signed the release, his hands “were getting progressively worse” and “seemed to get worse each day.” An expert affidavit submitted by Andreini indicates that time was, in fact, crucial to his recovery and suggests that Beck may have been aware that immediate surgery was necessary. Dr. Masud Seyal stated in the affidavit that “[a]fter the onset of Andreini’s bilateral ulnar neuropathy, as diagnosed by R. David Beck, prompt surgical intervention was the recommended procedure” and the two-month delay “in performing the nerve transposition on July 9, 1987, likely denied Mr. Andreini a more substantial recovery.”</p>
<p class="indent">Based on this evidence, a jury could find that defendants engaged in unfair dealing that significantly increased the effectiveness of their threat to refuse to undertake the corrective surgery. This conclusion is consistent with the Restatement’s official commentary. Comment “f” states that section 176(2)(b) “is concerned with cases in which the party making the threat has by unfair dealing achieved an advantage over the recipient that makes his [or her] threat unusually effective. Typical examples involve manipulative conduct during the bargaining stage that leaves one person at the mercy of the other.”</p>
<p class="indent">Having determined that Andreini has adduced sufficient facts to raise a jury question as to whether defendants made an improper threat, we now consider if Andreini has mustered sufficient facts as to whether he had any reasonable alternatives to signing the release. Again, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Andreini, we think that a jury could find that Andreini had no reasonable alternatives under the attendant circumstances. We acknowledge, as the trial court found, that Andreini could have left the hospital and that he was not in a life-threatening situation. However, there is evidence from which a jury could find that his alternatives were not reasonable. As mentioned earlier, Andreini averred that he was aware that his hands were getting progressively worse each day when he was confronted with the release and an expert affidavit suggests that immediate corrective surgery was indeed necessary to prevent further irreversible damage. When Andreini initially refused to sign the release, Beck allegedly told him that if he did not sign, Beck was “going to play hard ball” with him, which Andreini took to mean that defendants would not provide the corrective surgery regardless of who would pay for it. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page395" class="pagebreak">395</span>This evidence is sufficient to convince us that while Andreini may have had alternatives to signing the release form, there is a question of material fact as to whether those alternatives were reasonable.</p>
<p class="indent">We note that this analysis is also consistent with the comments to the Second Restatement. First, contrary to the trial court’s apparent reasoning, the Restatement recognizes that the victim does not need to be in a life-threatening situation for a jury to find that there were no reasonable alternatives. Comment “a” to section 175 states, “Courts originally restricted duress to threats involving loss of life, mayhem or imprisonment, but these restrictions have been greatly relaxed and, in order to constitute duress, the threat need only be improper * * *.” Second, the Restatement notes that duress can often result from situations in which time is of the essence, a factor that the trial court in the instant case seems to have overlooked. Comment “b” to section 175 observes that the reasonable alternative “standard is a practical one under which account must be taken of the exigencies in which the victim finds himself.”</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, we hold that Andreini has adduced sufficient evidence to raise an issue of fact as to whether defendants’ actions in procuring the release constituted an improper threat and whether Andreini had any reasonable alternatives to signing it. Consequently, Andreini has raised a jury question as to whether he signed the release under duress by improper threat under sections 175(1) and 176(2)(b) of the Restatement.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the trial court erred in (i) finding no material issues of fact with respect to whether Andreini knew he had suffered a legal injury within the applicable limitation period, (ii) interpreting the Utah Health Care Malpractice Act to bar his claim for failure to timely request prelitigation review, and (iii) finding no material issues of fact with respect to whether Andreini signed the release under duress. We therefore reverse both summary judgments and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">Standard form contracts probably account for more than ninety-nine percent of all contracts now made. Most persons have difficulty remembering the last time they contracted other than by standard form; except for casual oral agreements, they probably never have. But if they are active, they contract by standard form several times a day. Parking lot and theater tickets, package receipts, department store charge slips and gas station credit card purchase slips are all standard form contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, standard forms have come to dominate more than just routine transactions. For individuals, if not quite yet for corporations, form contracts are in common use for even such important matters as insurance, leases, deeds, mortgages, automobile purchases, and all of the various forms of consumer credit….</p>
<p class="indent">The predominance of standard forms is the best evidence of their necessity. They are characteristic of a mass production society and an integral part of it. They provide information and enforce order. A typical automobile insurance policy, for example, informs the policyholder how to conduct himself should he become involved in an accident or other kind of occurrence from which liability of the kind covered may arise. It enforces all or a part of such conduct by the sanction of denying insurance protection unless it is performed. These services are essential, and if they are to be provided at reasonable cost, they must be standardized and mass-produced like other goods and services in an industrial economy. The need for order could, in theory, be fully satisfied by officially drafted rules—by laws in the traditional sense. One of the beliefs by which our society is organized, however, is that at least some lawmaking is better accomplished in a decentralized manner. We therefore prefer that the economy be controlled privately to a large extent, and private control today means control largely by standard form.</p>
<p class="indent">… The extreme specialization of function of modern life requires that we contract with each other too frequently to take the time to reach even a mildly complicated agreement every time we do, and the complexity of modern life and modern law combine to demand that even minor agreements usually be complicated….</p>

<p class="indent">The impetus to the form-pad is clear, for any business unit: by standardizing terms, and by standardizing even the spot on the form where any individually dickered term appears, one saves all the time and skill otherwise needed to dig out and record the meaning of variant language; one makes check-up, totaling, follow-through, etc., into routine operations; one has duplicates (in many colors) available for the administration of a multidepartment business; and so on more. The content of the standardized terms accumulates experience, it avoids or reduces legal risks and also confers all kinds of operating leeways and advantages, all without need of either consulting counsel from instance to instance or of bargaining with the other parties. Not to be overlooked, either, is the tailoring of the crude misfitting hand-me-down pattern of the “general law” “in the absence of agreement” to the particular detailed working needs of your own line of business—whether apartment rentals, stock brokerage, international grain trade, installment selling of appliances, flour milling, sugar beet raising, or insurance….</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Note the extent in the following material that the elements of substantive unfairness of terms and inadequate manifestations of assent contribute to the conclusion that the agreement is unconscionable and unenforceable.</p>

<p class="indent">Two factors combine to bring about the modern consumer’s lack of effective legal power when he buys a product which is faulty but does not cause physical injury. Both of them stem from the fact that he is a little man in the scheme of things. First, there is an all-pervasive difficulty: our machinery of justice is simply not designed for easy use by the average citizen with a minor claim of any kind. If anything, it is designed to discourage him. He is not apt to know a lawyer and he does not particularly want to know one.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_74" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-74" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span></sup> And if he does muster up his courage and finds a lawyer, he will almost surely discover that his small claim is of no interest to that lawyer unless he is prepared to guarantee what to him will seem a preposterous sum. Even in those localities where small claims courts are supposed to be readily available, the use of the law remains a mysterious and a frightening prospect for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page399" class="pagebreak">399</span>average citizen. It is especially frightening for the below-average citizen, for “the poor man looks upon the law as an enemy, not as a friend. For him the law is always taking something away.”</p>
<p class="indent">The unavailability of simple process handicaps the little man regardless of the nature of his small claim, and it is handicap enough. But when he claims as a consumer against a seller, he encounters a second difficulty. Unless his claim is based on accidental injury to person or property caused by a defective product and is thus eligible for relief in tort, he claims in contract and must use a deck of doctrine that is stacked against him.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of his losing cards are colored “freedom of contract.” Contract (says the jurisprudence) is a voluntary association, and the parties are therefore free within broad limits to adopt such terms as they see fit. The reasonably equal bargaining power that is manifestly required to support this basic principle is presumed,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_75" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-75" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span></sup> as is the fact that parties to a written agreement know, or ought to know, the terms of their agreement. The ultimate consumer faced with a defective appliance or product, is almost sure to find that his seller has taken full advantage of these presumptions. He will discover that the printed contract that he “made” with his dealer contained one or more variously labeled terms and conditions designed by lawyers to give the dealer and everyone above him in the distribution pipeline maximum protection against consumer claims. He has, in short, entered into what we have come to call a contract of adhesion. Professor Patterson, who coined the phrase in 1919 in an article discussing life insurance policies, described such a contract as one “drawn up by the insurer, and the insured, who merely ‘adheres’ to it, has little choice as to its terms.” In less elegant but no less accurate language, a contract of adhesion is a contract that sticks the helpless consumer with standard form clauses that he might not have agreed to if he had actually had free choice.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of this printed boilerplate is apt to come in an envelope containing assorted other literature that is sealed in the carton or is taped to the chassis of the purchased equipment. In consequence it is seldom seen by the buyer until after delivery. Clearly, then, the buyer might persuasively claim that he cannot be bound by it because he never accepted it as part of his bargain. But it would make little practical difference if he not only saw it but read it and even understood it before his purchase. The result of an attempt on his part to reject it would be no purchase; it would be a rare and imaginative dealer indeed (to say nothing of a rare and imaginative customer) who would act in so non-institutional a fashion as to agree to a special warranty arrangement. Even if a dealer were willing to do so, his action would almost <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page400" class="pagebreak">400</span>surely be held not to have involved the deeper pockets of the supplier or the manufacturer of the product.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_76" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-76" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span></sup> And though theoretically the buyer could go elsewhere and buy from a merchant who did not so limit his obligations, he would almost certainly find that all competing goods were similarly limited.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_77" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-77" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span></sup> So to turn the matter on the buyer’s lack of knowledge would simply put dealers to the useless task of saying, “Look at this,” before they say, “Sign here.” A requirement that full disclosure be made concerning terms that can in fact be accepted or rejected is a meaningful and important element of contract law. But standard disclaimers and limitation of remedy clauses<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_78" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span></sup> such as make up the bulk of the printed boilerplate in contracts for the sale of consumer goods are not such choice-offering terms. The problem with such clauses is not lack of notice but lack of consumer power to bargain about them. The problem is that they are parts of contracts of adhesion.</p>

<p id="sec181" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Williams v. Walker–Thomas Furniture Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, 1965.</p>
<p class="sectionb">121 U.S.App.D.C. 315, 350 F.2d 445.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ J. S<small>KELLY</small> W<small>RIGHT</small>, C.J. Appellee, Walker–Thomas Furniture Company, operates a retail furniture store in the District of Columbia. During the period from 1957 to 1962 each appellant in these cases purchased a number of household items from Walker–Thomas, for which payment was to be made in installments. The terms of each purchase were contained in a printed form contract which set forth the value of the purchased item and purported to lease the item to appellant for a stipulated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page401" class="pagebreak">401</span>monthly rent payment. The contract then provided, in substance, that title would remain in Walker–Thomas until the total of all the monthly payments made equaled the stated value of the item, at which time appellants could take title. In the event of a default in the payment of any monthly installment, Walker–Thomas could repossess the item.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract further provided that “the amount of each periodical installment payment to be made by [purchaser] to the Company under this present lease shall be inclusive of and not in addition to the amount of each installment payment to be made by [purchaser] under such prior leases, bills or accounts; <span class="italic">and all payments now and hereafter made by [purchaser] shall be credited pro rata on all outstanding leases, bills and accounts</span> due the Company by [purchaser] at the time each such payment is made.” Emphasis added. The effect of this rather obscure provision was to keep a balance due on every item purchased until the balance due on all items, whenever purchased, was liquidated. As a result, the debt incurred at the time of purchase of each item was secured by the right to repossess all the items previously purchased by the same purchaser, and each new item purchased automatically became subject to a security interest arising out of the previous dealings.</p>
<p class="indent">On May 12, 1962, appellant Thorne purchased an item described as a Daveno, three tables, and two lamps, having total stated value of $391.10. Shortly thereafter, he defaulted on his monthly payments and appellee sought to replevy all the items purchased since the first transaction in 1958. Similarly, on April 17, 1962, appellant Williams bought a stereo set of stated value of $514.95.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_79" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-79" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> She too defaulted shortly thereafter, and appellee sought to replevy all the items purchased since December, 1957. The Court of General Sessions granted judgment for appellee. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed, and we granted appellants’ motion for leave to appeal to this court.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants’ principal contention, rejected by both the trial and the appellate courts below, is that these contracts, or at least some of them, are unconscionable and, hence, not enforceable. In its opinion in <span class="italic">Williams v. Walker–Thomas Furniture Company</span>, 198 A.2d 914, 916 (1964), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals explained its rejection of this contention as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Appellant’s second argument presents a more serious question. The record reveals that prior to the last purchase appellant had reduced the balance in her account to $164. The last purchase, a stereo set, raised the balance due to $678. Significantly, at the time of this and the preceding purchases, appellee was aware of appellant’s financial position. The reverse side of the stereo contract listed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page402" class="pagebreak">402</span>the name of appellant’s social worker and her $218 monthly stipend from the government. Nevertheless, with full knowledge that appellant had to feed, clothe and support both herself and seven children on this amount, appellee sold her a $514 stereo set.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">We cannot condemn too strongly appellee’s conduct. It raises serious questions of sharp practice and irresponsible business dealings. A review of the legislation in the District of Columbia affecting retail sales and the pertinent decisions of the highest court in this jurisdiction disclose, however, no ground upon which this court can declare the contracts in question contrary to public policy. We note that were the Maryland Retail Installment Sales Act, Art. 83, §§ 128–153, or its equivalent, in force in the District of Columbia, we could grant appellant appropriate relief. We think Congress should consider corrective legislation to protect the public from such exploitive contracts as were utilized in the case at bar.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not agree that the court lacked the power to refuse enforcement to contracts found to be unconscionable. In other jurisdictions, it has been held as a matter of common law that unconscionable contracts are not enforceable. While no decision of this court so holding has been found, the notion that an unconscionable bargain should not be given full enforcement is by no means novel. In <span class="italic">Scott v. United States</span>, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 443, 445 (1870), the Supreme Court stated:</p>
<p class="blockquote">* * * If a contract be unreasonable and unconscionable, but not void for fraud, a court of law will give to the party who sues for its breach damages, not according to its letter, but only such as he is equitably entitled to. * * * “</p>
<p class="indent">Since we have never adopted or rejected such a rule, the question here presented is actually one of first impression.</p>
<p class="indent">Congress has recently enacted the Uniform Commercial Code, which specifically provides that the court may refuse to enforce a contract which it finds to be unconscionable at the time it was made. 28 D.C.Code § 2–302 (Supp. IV 1965). The enactment of this section, which occurred subsequent to the contracts here in suit, does not mean that the common law of the District of Columbia was otherwise at the time of enactment nor does it preclude the court from adopting a similar rule in the exercise of its powers to develop the common law for the District of Columbia. In fact, in view of the absence of prior authority on the point, we consider the congressional adoption of § 2–302 persuasive authority for following the rationale of the cases from which the section is explicitly derived. Accordingly, we hold that where the element of unconscionability is present at the time a contract is made, the contract should not be enforced.</p>
<p class="indent">Unconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page403" class="pagebreak">403</span>unreasonably favorable to the other party. Whether a meaningful choice is present in a particular case can only be determined by consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the transaction. In many cases the meaningfulness of the choice is negated by a gross inequality of bargaining power. The manner in which the contract was entered is also relevant to this consideration. Did each party to the contract, considering his obvious education or lack of it, have a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract, or were the important terms hidden in a maze of fine print and minimized by deceptive sales practices? Ordinarily, one who signs an agreement without full knowledge of its terms might be held to assume the risk that he has entered a one-sided bargain. But when a party of little bargaining power, and hence little real choice, signs a commercially unreasonable contract with little or no knowledge of its terms, it is hardly likely that his consent, or even an objective manifestation of his consent, was ever given to all the terms. In such a case the usual rule that the terms of the agreement are not to be questioned should be abandoned and the court should consider whether the terms of the contract are so unfair that enforcement should be withheld.</p>
<p class="indent">In determining reasonableness or fairness, the primary concern must be with the terms of the contract considered in light of the circumstances existing when the contract was made. The test is not simple, nor can it be mechanically applied. The terms are to be considered “in the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case.” Corbin suggests the test as being whether the terms are “so extreme as to appear unconscionable according to the mores and business practices of the time and place.” We think this formulation correctly states the test to be applied in those cases where no meaningful choice was exercised upon entering the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the trial court and the appellate court did not feel that enforcement could be refused, no findings were made on the possible unconscionability of the contracts in these cases. Since the record is not sufficient for our deciding the issue as a matter of law, the cases must be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="indent">So ordered.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ D<small>ANAHER</small>, C<small>IRCUIT</small> J<small>UDGE</small> (dissenting). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals obviously was as unhappy about the situation here presented as any of us can possibly be. Its opinion in the <span class="italic">Williams</span> case, quoted in the majority text, concludes: “We think Congress should consider corrective legislation to protect the public from such exploitive contracts as were utilized in the case at bar.”</p>
<p class="indent">My view is thus summed up by an able court which made no finding that there had actually been sharp practice. Rather the appellant seems to have known precisely where she stood.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page404" class="pagebreak">404</div>
<p class="indent">There are many aspects of public policy here involved. What is a luxury to some may seem an outright necessity to others. Is public oversight to be required of the expenditures of relief funds? A washing machine, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, in the hands of a relief client might become a fruitful source of income. Many relief clients may well need credit, and certain business establishments will take long chances on the sale of items, expecting their pricing policies will afford a degree of protection commensurate with the risk. Perhaps a remedy when necessary will be found within the provisions of the “Loan Shark” law, D.C.Code §§ 26–601 <span class="italic">et seq.</span> (1961).</p>
<p class="indent">I mention such matters only to emphasize the desirability of a cautious approach to any such problem, particularly since the law for so long has allowed parties such great latitude in making their own contracts. I dare say there must annually be thousands upon thousands of installment credit transactions in this jurisdiction, and one can only speculate as to the effect the decision in these cases will have.</p>
<p class="indent">I join the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in its disposition of the issues.</p>
<p id="sec182" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The security agreement Ora Lee Williams agreed to in this case contained what is referred to in the trade as a cross-collateral clause. Today such clauses are regulated under a wide variety of consumer protection legislation and, to some extent, the federal Bankruptcy Code. <span class="italic">See</span> Uniform Consumer Credit Code §§ 3.302–3.303. What is there about this contract that is unconscionable? Is it unconscionable because Ms. Williams didn’t understand what it said? Is it unconscionable because it was on a printed form with fine print? Is it unconscionable because Ms. Williams was poor? Was on public relief? Had no real opportunity to negotiate? Is it unconscionable because cross-collateral clauses are generally unjustified by business risks or inherently unfair? Is it unconscionable because it is wrong to sell a woman with seven minor children to support that is relying on public assistance a $514 stereo set?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Didn’t Ms. Williams have meaningful choices such as (a) not buying the stereo set until she had cash, (b) borrowing money elsewhere, (c) doing without a stereo? Should Ms. Williams be held less responsible for her contractual obligations than other adults not on public relief?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. In drafting a form agreement, isn’t a lawyer justified in loading it with clauses favorable to her client? If the lawyer thinks a particular clause probably is unenforceable because a court is likely to hold it unconscionable, she has an obligation to advise her client of this probability. If the client nonetheless wants the clause included, does the lawyer violate her professional obligations in acceding? What can the lawyer do in this situation?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page405" class="pagebreak">405</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Is this decision or UCC § 2–302 generally likely to increase or decrease the availability of consumer goods to the poor?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. While recognizing that the legal power of government may be needed to protect consumers from unfair terms in contracts for sale of goods, UCC § 2–302 suffers from two related weaknesses: (a) The amorphous doctrine does not give clear guidance what kinds of contract terms are impermissible; and (b) the concept relies on court interpretation through a long series of lawsuits. Professor Arthur Leff aptly described these problems in his article <span class="italic">Unconscionability and the Crowd—Consumers and the Common Law Tradition</span>, 31 U. P<small>ITT</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 349 (1970), which is a response to an early defense of § 2–302 by Professor John Murray:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In order to establish the unenforceability of any particular provision, in any particular jurisdiction, there will have to be at least one lawsuit, with the relatively high transaction costs (especially relative to the amount at issue) of that law-reform technique. Now, what happens after that first lawsuit? Take a case like <span class="italic">Williams</span>. In that case the court remanded for a finding whether a cross-collateral clause, allowing the seller to repossess all items ever bought from it by the buyer, upon default in payment for the most recently purchased item, was “unconscionable.” Let us assume that on remand that it is decided that, at least where the buyer is a lady on relief with seven children, such a clause is unenforceable. What’s the seller’s next move? Why to “distinguish the case,” of course. Perhaps the next thing to do is make the clause clearer, maybe to make it read: “Caution: if you don’t pay for what you just bought we may be able to take back whatever we ever sold you.” Well, now we’ve got a new case for case-by-case development. O.K., let’s assume that the seller loses that one too, perhaps because the apparent assent was not “verified” (in Professor Murray’s terms) because the buyer did not have, in the “relevant geographic market,” any alternative to such a clause when buying what he bought, or any functional equivalent of it (to make which finding the court must also decide, under Professor Murray’s approach, what the “relevant product market” is). Fine. We’ve just had two little internal antitrust suits, (under § 2–302(2), I assume), one on relevant geographical markets and one on functional equivalence, and the seller has lost again. But, of course, the next seller who wants to use a clause like the first seller ought not be daunted. After all, if his neighborhood or product is different, it’s a whole new ball game.</p>
<p class="blockquote">…</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">To cut this short, the problem is not with Professor Murray’s criteria, but with the common-law tradition itself when sought to be used to regulate the quality of transactions on a case-by-case basis, each one of which is economically trivial (so that you need free legal help for the consumer, and the seller can almost always avoid nasty precedent by an early surrender or settlement), and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page406" class="pagebreak">406</span>each one of which depends upon several doses of “the total context of the fact situation” and “copious examination of the manifestations of the parties and the surrounding circumstances followed by a balancing effort.” Wouldn’t it be easier and far more effective, if one finds these cross-collateral clauses, or some others, offensive in consumer transactions, just to face one’s conclusion and regulate them out of existence, in a manner no lawyer could conscientiously avoid? Wouldn’t it be better, finally, to face the political problems and pass a statute that deals with cross-collateral clauses, negotiable-note and waiver-of-defense financing, abusive collection devices, a wide panoply of quasi-crooked marketing devices, and so on, and maybe even gross overpricing (on analogy to the civil-law <span class="italic">laesio enormis</span> progeny) and tuck in, along with private causes of action for the victims, an administrative enforcement arm to police these repetitive nasty practices (and perhaps get compensation for the whole class of bilked consumers theretofore identifiably bilked)? Isn’t there some economy of scale in that approach? Remember, the idea is to change as many nasty forms and practices as possible, not merely to add to the glorious common law tradition of eventually coping. Wouldn’t more be changed by explicit positive law, administratively interpreted and enforced, than by the feed-back from easily distinguishable, easily stallable, exceedingly expensive cases?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Form contracts resemble legislation in that they are standardized rules imposed on a particular transaction and not bargained for in each case. But legislation carries the legitimacy and imprimatur of the government. Why should the interests of the parties be determined by words on a privately drafted form no one reads? An alternative would be to enact a consumer sales code that would displace the fine print with statutory provisions that have been thought through with seller and consumer interests in mind. Beginning a generation ago, both Congress and State legislatures adopted a number of consumer protection statutes with particular emphasis on warranty and credit terms. Most of these laws concentrate on requiring disclosure of the terms of the transaction to the consumer or on providing remedies to consumers who have been victimized by unfair or deceptive sales and credit practices. Some of these laws have gone beyond notification and remedies and have directly outlawed certain abusive contract provisions. The Uniform Consumer Credit Code, which has been adopted by nine states, deals with the substance of a number of lender practices that are subject to abuse, such as wage assignments, confession of judgment clauses, and, as was noted in question 1, cross-collateral clauses. Acting under the Magnuson–Moss Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2301 et seq., the Federal Trade Commission has adopted regulations <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page407" class="pagebreak">407</span>that substantially limit holder-in-due-course defenses, wage assignments, confessions of judgment, security interests in household goods, and waivers of property exemptions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">7</span>. Notwithstanding UCC § 2-302 and other more specific sorts of consumer protection legislation, exploitive transactions not unlike that discussed in <span class="italic">Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.</span> remain common in America’s cities. The very profitable “rent-to-own” business has managed to escape consumer credit regulation targeted at some perceived abuses on the ground that it leases consumer products rather than sells them on credit. The practices of a leading firm in that industry, Rent-A-Center, first came to national attention in a newspaper exposé, Alix M. Friedman, <span class="italic">Peddling Dreams: A Marketing Giant Uses Its Sales Prowess to Profit on Poverty</span>, W<small>ALL</small> S<small>T</small>. J. S<small>EPT</small>. 22, 1993, at A1. The <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span> reported that Rent-A-Center, which leases consumer electronics, furniture, and other household goods to both urban and rural poor, was the conglomerate Thorn EMI’s most profitable business, earning margins more than double those of conventional retailers. Rent-A-Center’s success was based on onerous lease terms that amounted to “heads I win, tails you lose.” If the consumer made all the weekly payments required under the lease, she effectively purchased the goods on credit with an implicit interest rate of over 200%. If, as was far more likely, she returned the goods or defaulted, Rent-A-Center would repossess the goods and relet them on similar terms again and again, reaping even greater profits. One Rent-A-Center customer explained to the <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span> that she leased a new microwave oven from Rent-A-Center <span class="italic">after</span> suffering a particularly humiliating repossession of her refrigerator, couch, and other household goods because she needed the oven and “I felt like there was nowhere else to go.”</p>
<p class="indent">What does outlawing a particular term of a consumer contract like cross-collateralization accomplish when the Ms. Williamses of the world need microwave ovens they can’t afford, have nowhere else to go, and Rent-A-Center can set prices and lease rates at levels so exorbitant that it is even more profitable for it to collect a few payments and repossess and relet the oven than it is to collect contractual payments equivalent to earning 200% interest annually?</p>

<p class="noindent-squ1">■ F<small>RAIMAN</small>, J. This is a motion to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to CPLR Rule 3211(a) paras. 1, 7 and subd. (c) on the grounds that there is a defense founded upon documentary evidence and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff is a 37 year old college graduate, having entered college at the age of 32. Seeking to attend law school, he took the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) twice within a four month period in 1973–74. Defendant is a non-profit corporation engaged in the business of preparing and administering various well-known educational tests, including the LSAT, for use by colleges and graduate schools throughout the nation. It has administered the LSAT since 1954. The LSAT is an objective test designed to measure general aptitude for the study of law of candidates seeking admission to law school. It consists of approximately 130 so-called multiple choice questions and it also has a section of about 70 questions of a similar nature designed to test writing ability. Defendant administers the LSAT for the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC), a non-profit membership association of graduate schools of law. The LSAC sets policy for administration of the examinations and the reporting of scores.</p>
<p class="indent">Test scores play an important role in determining whether a candidate will be admitted to law school. To insure that they accurately reflect the candidate’s own effort, the administration of the tests are carefully monitored, and after they are scored, individual scores are checked by computer against any previous scores by the same candidate. Where an increase of more than 150 points (out of a total of 800) is found, defendant conducts an investigation before the candidate’s score is reported to the law schools.</p>
<p class="indent">Each candidate who applies to take the LSAT is sent a booklet entitled “Law School Admissions Bulletin” and a registration form. Upon receipt of the completed form, defendant sends the candidate an admission card to take the examination on a specified date at a designated testing center. The registration form requires the applicant to write out in longhand the following statement and to sign it:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">* * * I accept the conditions set forth in the Bulletin concerning the administration of the test and the reporting of information to law schools.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff took the examination in December 1973 and again in April 1974. Before each examination, he was sent a copy of the Bulletin and completed in his own handwriting the statement above on his registration forms. The Bulletins received by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page409" class="pagebreak">409</span>plaintiff each contained the following language under the heading “Scores Cancelled by ETS”:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">We are concerned with reporting only valid scores. On rare occasions, misconduct * * * or circumstances beyond the candidate’s control * * * may render scores invalid. If doubts are raised about your score because of these or other circumstances, we will expect you to cooperate in our investigation. We reserve the right to cancel any test score if, in our sole opinion, there is adequate reason to question its validity. Before exercising this right, we will offer you an opportunity to take the test again at no additional fee.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">If we cancel a score, we will notify the law schools that received, or were to receive, the scores as well as the schools receiving subsequent reports.</p>
<p class="indent">On his December, 1973 examination plaintiff received a score of 399 on the LSAT portion and 26 on the writing ability portion. His April, 1974 LSAT score was 637, or 238 points higher, and his writing ability score was 62. The 238 point discrepancy between the two LSAT scores prompted an investigation by defendant which disclosed striking similarities between plaintiff’s answers and the answers of one “KL,” the candidate seated adjacent to plaintiff. Plaintiff answered 39 of the 130 multiple choice questions on the LSAT portion of the test incorrectly. Of these, 27 were the same incorrect answers as those selected by KL. The significance of this correlation is made evident from an analysis by defendant of the answer sheets of ten other candidates taking the same LSAT who obtained scores in the same range as plaintiff and KL. Comparing their incorrect answers with plaintiff’s, discloses that, on average, there were only 7 incorrect responses identical to plaintiff’s. Of the ten other answer sheets analyzed, the most incorrect responses on any one answer sheet which were identical to those of plaintiff was 11. A comparison and analysis of plaintiff’s writing ability answer sheet with KL’s and the ten other candidates disclosed a similar result.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_80" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-80" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">On the basis of the foregoing, defendant wrote to plaintiff requesting that he furnish any information which he believed was relevant to his questioned scores. In addition, he was offered an opportunity to take the examination again at a regularly scheduled time at no cost. If he elected to do so, and his retest score came within 50 points of the questioned score, defendant stated that the questioned score would be forwarded to the law schools. On the other hand, if the retest score failed to confirm the questioned score, or if plaintiff refused to take the retest, defendant indicated that it would cancel the questioned score and notify the law schools that plaintiff’s score was cancelled “due to serious doubt as to [its] authenticity.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page410" class="pagebreak">410</div>
<p class="indent">In response to this letter, plaintiff submitted a sworn statement that he did not cheat on the examination. However, he refused to take a retest. He then commenced the instant action for a declaratory judgment and an injunction restraining defendant from cancelling his April, 1974 test score; from notifying the law schools that this action was taken because of the score’s doubtful authenticity; and compelling defendant to report the April, 1974 score to the law schools as a valid score.</p>
<p class="indent">In support of its motion to dismiss the complaint, defendant alleges that plaintiff is barred by the contract he entered into when he agreed on his registration forms to accept the conditions set forth in the Bulletin concerning the administration of the test and the reporting of results to the law schools. Defendant contends that its actions are in full accord with the following provisions in the Bulletin:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">We reserve the right to cancel any test score if, in our sole opinion, there is adequate reason to question its validity * * *. If we cancel a score, we will notify the law schools that * * * were to receive the score * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">We turn now to a consideration of that portion of the injunctive relief sought by plaintiff wherein he seeks to restrain defendant from cancelling his April, 1974 test scores and to compel it to forward the scores to the law schools. As noted above, the right to cancel any test score if in its opinion there was adequate reason to question its validity was expressly reserved to itself by defendant in the Bulletin, and plaintiff accepted that as well as all other conditions set forth in the Bulletin when he completed his registration form. Nevertheless, plaintiff contends that he is not bound by his agreement, because, he argues, his contract with defendant is a contract of adhesion, and therefore void. A contract of adhesion is one entered into between parties with unequal bargaining power. They are typically standard contracts which are offered by the party with strong bargaining power to the weaker party on a take it or leave it basis. The instant agreement would appear to fit this description. Almost every accredited law school in the United States requires a candidate for admission to take the LSAT. Thus, when plaintiff decided to attend law school he had no alternative but to accept the standard conditions fixed by defendant for all test takers. Plaintiff could neither contract with a party other than defendant to take a law school aptitude test, since no such entity exists, or indicate to defendant that the terms contained in the Bulletin were not acceptable to him. In the latter case it is clear that if he had done so he would not have been permitted to take the examination.</p>
<p class="indent">However, while plaintiff’s description of the agreement herein as a contract of adhesion may be justified, his conclusion that it is therefore void, is not. Where the court finds that an agreement is a contract of adhesion, effort will frequently be made to protect the weaker party from the agreement’s harsher terms by a variety of pretexts, while still keeping the elementary rules of the law of contracts intact. Kessler, “Contracts of Adhesion—Some Thoughts about Freedom of Contract,” 43 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page411" class="pagebreak">411</span>Colum.L.Rev. 629 (1943). The Court may, for example, find the obnoxious clause “ambiguous,” even where no ambiguity exists, and then construe it against its author; or it may find the clause to be against public policy and declare it unenforceable; or finally, the court may hold that although the offending clause prohibits a recovery by plaintiff <span class="italic">ex contractu,</span> it does not prohibit a recovery in tort.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the issue in the instant case is whether the clause reserving to defendant itself the right to cancel plaintiff’s test score if there is a question about its validity, and requiring him to take a retest in such event, is so unfair and unreasonable that the court, having found it a part of a contract of adhesion, will disregard it by means of one or more of the pretexts above. The issue as thus stated must be answered in the negative. To the extent that defendant can accurately predict the aptitude of a candidate for law school by means of its test results, it performs a highly valuable service not only to the law schools but to the public as well. Moreover, the accuracy of its predictions is defendant’s sole stock in trade. The less accurate as a forecaster its tests are, the less value they have to the law schools. Thus, if defendant reasonably believed that the test scores of plaintiff as scored on the April, 1974 test, did not accurately reflect his aptitude for law school, it acted within its right to protect its own image as well as its obligation to the schools who are its clients in cancelling plaintiff’s scores and requiring him to take a retest….</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the evidence that plaintiff did not achieve his scores on the April, 1974 LSAT unaided was sufficient to justify the action contemplated by defendant. Moreover, its offer of a free retest under normal testing conditions with the understanding that it would forward plaintiff’s April, 1974 scores if the retest score came within 50 points of the earlier scores was eminently fair and reasonable under the circumstances. Finally, with respect to plaintiff’s claim that defendant’s actions violated the Due Process clause of the Constitution, it is sufficient to note that the 14th Amendment is applicable only to state action and not private action and hence is not relevant here. Even if it were, the court finds no basis to conclude that plaintiff was not afforded due process.</p>
<p class="indent">For all the foregoing reasons, the motion to dismiss so much of the complaint as seeks to enjoin defendant from cancelling plaintiff’s April, 1974 test scores, and to compel it to forward those scores to the law schools is granted.</p>

<p class="noindent-squ1">■ M<small>OSK</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, we consider a number of issues related to the validity of a mandatory employment arbitration agreement, i.e., an agreement by an employee to arbitrate wrongful termination or employment discrimination claims rather than filing suit in court, which an employer imposes on a prospective or current employee as a condition of employment. The employees in this case claim that employees may not be compelled to arbitrate antidiscrimination claims brought under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). We conclude that such claims are in fact arbitrable <span class="italic">if</span> the arbitration permits an employee to vindicate his or her statutory rights. As explained, in order for such vindication to occur, the arbitration must meet certain minimum requirements, including neutrality of the arbitrator, the provision of adequate discovery, a written decision that will permit a limited form of judicial review, and limitations on the costs of arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">The employees further claim that several provisions of the arbitration agreement are unconscionable, both because they fail to meet these minimum requirements and because the arbitration agreement is not bilateral. We conclude that the agreement possesses a damages limitation that is contrary to public policy, and that it is unconscionably unilateral.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the employees contend that the presence of these unconscionable provisions renders the entire arbitration agreement unenforceable. The employer argues that even if some of the provisions are unconscionable or contrary to public policy, the proper remedy is to strike or restrict those clauses pursuant to Civil Code section 1670.5, and to enforce the rest of the arbitration agreement. The trial court chose the employees’ preferred solution of refusing to enforce the arbitration agreement, but the Court of Appeal sided with the employer and enforced the agreement minus the one provision it found unconscionable. We conclude, for reasons explained below, that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable and that therefore the Court of Appeal’s judgment must be reversed.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. S<small>TATEMENT OF</small> F<small>ACTS AND</small> P<small>ROCEDURAL</small> I<small>SSUES</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Marybeth Armendariz and Dolores Olague-Rodgers (hereafter the employees) filed a complaint for wrongful termination against their former employer, Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (hereafter the employer). The complaint and certain documents filed in support of the employer’s petition to compel arbitration provide us with the basic factual background of this case. In July and August of 1995, the employer hired the employees in the “Provider Relations Group” and they were later given supervisory positions with annual salaries of $38,000. On June 20, 1996, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page413" class="pagebreak">413</span>they were informed that their positions were “being eliminated” and that they were “being terminated.” During their year of employment, they claim that their supervisors and coworkers engaged in sexually based harassment and discrimination. The employees alleged that they were “terminated … because of their perceived and/or actual sexual orientation (heterosexual).”</p>
<p class="indent">Both employees had filled out and signed employment application forms, which included an arbitration clause pertaining to any future claim of wrongful termination. Later, they executed a separate employment arbitration agreement, containing the same arbitration clause. The clause states in full: “I agree as a condition of my employment, that in the event my employment is terminated, and I contend that such termination was wrongful or otherwise in violation of the conditions of employment or was in violation of any express or implied condition, term or covenant of employment, whether founded in fact or in law, including but not limited to the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or otherwise in violation of any of my rights, I and Employer agree to submit any such matter to binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions of title 9 of Part III of the California Code of Civil Procedure, commencing at section 1280 et seq. or any successor or replacement statutes. I and Employer further expressly agree that in any such arbitration, my exclusive remedies for violation of the terms, conditions or covenants of employment shall be limited to a sum equal to the wages I would have earned from the date of any discharge until the date of the arbitration award. I understand that I shall not be entitled to any other remedy, at law or in equity, including but not limited to reinstatement and/or injunctive relief.”</p>
<p class="indent">The employees’ complaint against the employer alleges a cause of action for violation of the FEHA<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_81" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-81" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> and three additional causes of action for wrongful termination based on tort and contract theories of recovery. The complaint sought general damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, and the recovery of attorney fees and costs of suit.</p>
<p class="indent">The employer countered by filing a motion for an order to compel arbitration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2. The parties submitted declarations in support of, and in opposition to, the motion. Relying on <span class="italic">Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc.</span>, the trial court denied the motion on the ground that the arbitration provision in question was an unconscionable contract. The trial court first found that the arbitration agreement was an “adhesion contract.” It also found that several of the provisions of the contract are “so one-sided as to ‘shock the conscience.’” In particular, it singled out the fact that only employees who file claims against an employer are required to arbitrate their claims, but not vice versa. Second, the agreement limits damages to backpay, precluding damages available for statutory <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page414" class="pagebreak">414</span>antidiscrimination claims and tort damages, such as punitive damages. The trial court also mentioned the supposed lack of discovery under the arbitration agreement. It concluded: “Given the overall unfairness of the provision,” this was not an appropriate case for striking the unlawful provisions of the arbitration agreement; instead it invalidated the entire agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">After the employer filed a timely appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed. The court concluded that the contract was indeed one of adhesion and that the damages provision was unconscionable and contrary to public policy. But for reasons elaborated below, the Court of Appeal held, contrary to the trial court, that the rest of the arbitration agreement should be enforced. It also determined that because the agreement incorporated the California Arbitration Act (CAA), adequate discovery, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.05, was available.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">…</span></p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">D. Unconscionability of the Arbitration Agreement</span></p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">1. General Principles of Unconscionability</span></p>
<p class="indent">… In this section, we will consider objections to arbitration that apply more generally to any type of arbitration imposed on the employee by the employer as a condition of employment, regardless of the type of claim being arbitrated. These objections fall under the rubric of “unconscionability.”</p>
<p class="indent">We explained the judicially created doctrine of unconscionability in <span class="italic">Scissor-Tail</span>. Unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion. “The term [contract of adhesion] signifies a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.” (<span class="italic">Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos.</span> (1961)). If the contract is adhesive, the court must then determine whether “other factors are present which, under established legal rules—legislative or judicial—operate to render it [unenforceable].” (<span class="italic">Scissor-Tail</span>.) “Generally speaking, there are two judicially imposed limitations on the enforcement of adhesion contracts or provisions thereof. The first is that such a contract or provision which does not fall within the reasonable expectations of the weaker or ‘adhering’ party will not be enforced against him. The second—a principle of equity applicable to all contracts generally—is that a contract or provision, even if consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties, will be denied enforcement if, considered in its context, it is unduly oppressive or ‘unconscionable.’” Subsequent cases have referred to both the “reasonable expectations” and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page415" class="pagebreak">415</span>“oppressive” limitations as being aspects of unconscionability. (See <span class="italic">A &amp; M Produce Co. v. FMC Corp.</span> (1982)).</p>
<p class="indent">In 1979, the Legislature enacted Civil Code section 1670.5, which codified the principle that a court can refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract. As section 1670.5, subdivision (a) states: “If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.” Because unconscionability is a reason for refusing to enforce contracts generally, it is also a valid reason for refusing to enforce an arbitration agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281, which, as noted, provides that arbitration agreements are “valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist [at law or in equity] for the revocation of any contract.” The United States Supreme Court, in interpreting the same language found in section 2 of the FAA, recognized that “generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or <span class="italic">unconscionability,</span> may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements….” (<span class="italic">Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,</span> italics added.)</p>
<p class="indent">As explained in <span class="italic">A &amp; M Produce Co.,</span> “unconscionability has both a ‘procedural’ and a ‘substantive’ element,” the former focusing on “oppression” or “surprise” due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on “overly harsh” or “one-sided” results. “The prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.” (<span class="italic">Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc.</span>) But they need not be present in the same degree. “Essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates the terms, in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.” (15 Williston on Contracts (3d ed. 1972) § 1763A; see also <span class="italic">A &amp; M Produce Co.</span>) In other words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">2. Unconscionability and Mandatory Employment Arbitration</span></p>
<p class="indent">Applying the above principles to this case, we first determine whether the arbitration agreement is adhesive. There is little dispute that it is. It was imposed on employees as a condition of employment and there was no opportunity to negotiate.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, in the case of preemployment arbitration contracts, the economic pressure exerted by employers on all but the most sought-after employees may be particularly acute, for the arbitration agreement stands between the employee and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page416" class="pagebreak">416</span>necessary employment, and few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration requirement. While arbitration may have its advantages in terms of greater expedition, informality, and lower cost, it also has, from the employee’s point of view, potential disadvantages: waiver of a right to a jury trial, limited discovery, and limited judicial review. Various studies show that arbitration is advantageous to employers not only because it reduces the costs of litigation, but also because it reduces the size of the award that an employee is likely to get, particularly if the employer is a “repeat player” in the arbitration system. (Bingham, <span class="italic">Employment Arbitration: The Repeat Player Effect</span> (1997) 1 Employee Rts. &amp; Employment Policy J. 189; Schwartz, <span class="italic">supra,</span> 1997 Wis. L.Rev. at pp. 60-61.) It is perhaps for this reason that it is almost invariably the employer who seeks to compel arbitration. (See Schwartz, <span class="italic">supra,</span> 1997 Wis. L.Rev. at pp. 60-63.)</p>
<p class="indent">Arbitration is favored in this state as a voluntary means of resolving disputes, and this voluntariness has been its bedrock justification. As we stated recently: “[P]olicies favoring the efficiency of private arbitration as a means of dispute resolution must sometimes yield to its fundamentally contractual nature, and to the attendant requirement that arbitration shall proceed as the parties themselves have agreed.” (<span class="italic">Vandenberg v. Superior Court</span>.) Given the lack of choice and the potential disadvantages that even a fair arbitration system can harbor for employees, we must be particularly attuned to claims that employers with superior bargaining power have imposed one-sided, substantively unconscionable terms as part of an arbitration agreement. “Private arbitration may resolve disputes faster and cheaper than judicial proceedings. Private arbitration, however, may also become an instrument of injustice imposed on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis. The courts must distinguish the former from the latter, to ensure that private arbitration systems resolve disputes not only with speed and economy but also with fairness.” (<span class="italic">Engalla</span> (Kennard, J., concurring)). With this in mind, we turn to the employees’ specific unconscionability claims.</p>
<p class="indent">Aside from FEHA issues discussed in the previous part of this opinion, the employees contend that the agreement is substantively unconscionable because it requires only employees to arbitrate their wrongful termination claims against the employer, but does not require the employer to arbitrate claims it may have against the employees. In asserting that this lack of mutuality is unconscionable, they rely primarily on the opinion of the Court of Appeal in <span class="italic">Stirlen</span>. The employee in that case was hired as a vice-president and chief financial officer; his employment contract provided for arbitration “‘in the event there is any dispute arising out of [the employee’s] employment with the Company,’” including “the termination of that employment.” The agreement specifically excluded certain types of disputes from the scope of arbitration, including those relating to the protection of the employer’s intellectual and other property and the enforcement of a postemployment covenant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page417" class="pagebreak">417</span>not to compete, which were to be litigated in state or federal court. The employee was to waive the right to challenge the jurisdiction of such a court. The arbitration agreement further provided that the damages available would be limited to “‘the amount of actual damages for breach of contract, less any proper offset for mitigation of such damages.’” When an arbitration claim was filed, payments of any salary or benefits were to cease “‘without penalty to the Company,’” pending the outcome of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> court concluded that the agreement was one of adhesion, even though the employee in question was a high-level executive, because of the lack of opportunity to negotiate. The court then concluded that the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable. The court relied in part on <span class="italic">Saika v. Gold</span> (1996), in which the court had refused to enforce a provision in an arbitration agreement between a doctor and a patient that would allow a “trial de novo” if the arbitrator’s award was $25,000 or greater. The <span class="italic">Saika</span> court reasoned that such a clause was tantamount to making arbitration binding when the patient lost the arbitration but not binding if the patient won a significant money judgment. <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> concluded that the Supercuts agreement lacked even the “modicum of bilaterality” that was present in <span class="italic">Saika.</span> The employee pursuing claims against the employer had to bear not only with the inherent shortcomings of arbitration—limited discovery, limited judicial review, limited procedural protections—but also significant damage limitations imposed by the arbitration agreement. The employer, on the other hand, in pursuing its claims, was not subject to these disadvantageous limitations and had written into the agreement special advantages, such as a waiver of jurisdictional objections by the employee if sued by the employer.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> court did not hold that all lack of mutuality in a contract of adhesion was invalid. “We agree a contract can provide a ‘margin of safety’ that provides the party with superior bargaining strength a type of extra protection for which it has a legitimate commercial need without being unconscionable. However, unless the ‘business realities’ that create the special need for such an advantage are explained in the contract itself, which is not the case here, it must be factually established.” The <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> court found no “business reality” to justify the lack of mutuality, concluding that the terms of the arbitration clause were “so extreme as to appear unconscionable according to the mores and business practices of the time and place.”</p>
<p class="indent">The court in <span class="italic">Kinney v. United HealthCare Services, Inc.</span> (1999), came to the same conclusion with respect to an arbitration agreement to compel the employee, but not the employer, to submit claims to arbitration. As the <span class="italic">Kinney</span> court stated: “Faced with the issue of whether a unilateral obligation to arbitrate is unconscionable, we conclude that it is. The party who is required to submit his or her claims to arbitration [forgoes] the right, otherwise guaranteed by the federal and state Constitutions, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page418" class="pagebreak">418</span>to have those claims tried before a jury. Further, except in extraordinary circumstances, that party has no avenue of review for an adverse decision, even if that decision is based on an error of fact or law that appears on the face of the ruling and results in substantial injustice to that party. By contrast, the party requiring the other to waive these rights retains all of the benefits and protections the right to a judicial forum provides. Given the basic and substantial nature of the rights at issue, we find that the unilateral obligation to arbitrate is itself so one-sided as to be substantively unconscionable.” The court also found that certain terms of the arbitration agreement—limits to discovery and caps on compensatory and punitive damages—“heightened” its unconscionability.</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> and <span class="italic">Kinney</span> are correct in requiring this “modicum of bilaterality” in an arbitration agreement. Given the disadvantages that may exist for plaintiffs arbitrating disputes, it is unfairly one-sided for an employer with superior bargaining power to impose arbitration on the employee as plaintiff but not to accept such limitations when it seeks to prosecute a claim against the employee, without at least some reasonable justification for such one-sidedness based on “business realities.” As has been recognized “‘unconscionability turns not only on a “one-sided” result, but also on an absence of “justification” for it.’” If the arbitration system established by the employer is indeed fair, then the employer as well as the employee should be willing to submit claims to arbitration. Without reasonable justification for this lack of mutuality, arbitration appears less as a forum for neutral dispute resolution and more as a means of maximizing employer advantage. Arbitration was not intended for this purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">The employer cites a number of cases that have held that a lack of mutuality in an arbitration agreement does not render the contract illusory as long as the employer agrees to be bound by the arbitration of employment disputes. We agree that such lack of mutuality does not render the contract illusory, i.e., lacking in mutual consideration. We conclude, rather, that in the context of an arbitration agreement imposed by the employer on the employee, such a one-sided term is unconscionable. Although parties are free to contract for asymmetrical remedies and arbitration clauses of varying scope, <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> and <span class="italic">Kinney</span> are correct that the doctrine of unconscionability limits the extent to which a stronger party may, through a contract of adhesion, impose the arbitration forum on the weaker party without accepting that forum for itself.</p>
<p class="indent">… We disagree that enforcing “a modicum of bilaterality” in arbitration agreements singles out arbitration for suspect status. The <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> court correctly rejected a similar criticism: “Some California courts have been [loath] to apply the doctrine of unconscionability articulated in <span class="italic">Scissor-Tail</span> to arbitration agreements subject to the FAA on the ground that the opinion in that case ‘weav[es] together principles of adhesion contracts and state statutes governing the neutrality of arbitrators,’ and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page419" class="pagebreak">419</span>the United States Supreme Court has taught ‘that a court may not rely upon anything that is unique to an agreement to arbitrate when assessing unconscionability of an agreement governed by the FAA.’ (<span class="italic">Heily v. Superior Court</span> (1988)). However, while the <span class="italic">form</span> of unconscionability involved in <span class="italic">Scissor-Tail</span> related to arbitration—the nonneutrality of the arbitrator—the fundamental principles set forth by the Supreme Court in that case relate to unconscionability in general, not simply to arbitration agreements.”</p>
<p class="indent">We agree with the <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> court that the ordinary principles of unconscionability may manifest themselves in forms peculiar to the arbitration context. One such form is an agreement requiring arbitration only for the claims of the weaker party but a choice of forums for the claims of the stronger party. The application of this principle to arbitration does not disfavor arbitration. It is no disparagement of arbitration to acknowledge that it has, as noted, both advantages and disadvantages. The perceived advantages of the judicial forum for plaintiffs include the availability of discovery and the fact that courts and juries are viewed as more likely to adhere to the law and less likely than arbitrators to “split the difference” between the two sides, thereby lowering damages awards for plaintiffs. (See Haig, <span class="italic">Corporate Counsel’s Guide: Development Report on Cost-Effective Management of Corporate Litigation</span> (July 1999) 610 PLI/Lit. 177, 186-187 [“a company that believes it has a strong legal and factual position may want to avoid arbitration, with its tendency to ‘split the difference,’ in favor of a judicial forum where it may be more likely to win a clearcut victory”]; see also Schwartz, <span class="italic">supra,</span> 1997 Wisc.L.Rev. at pp. 64-65.) An employer may accordingly consider courts to be a forum superior to arbitration when it comes to vindicating its own contractual and statutory rights, or may consider it advantageous to have a choice of arbitration or litigation when determining how best to pursue a claim against an employee. It does not disfavor arbitration to hold that an employer may not impose a system of arbitration on an employee that seeks to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages of arbitration for itself at the employee’s expense. On the contrary, a unilateral arbitration agreement imposed by the employer without reasonable justification reflects the very mistrust of arbitration that has been repudiated by the United States Supreme Court in <span class="italic">Doctors’ Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto</span> and other cases. We emphasize that if an employer does have reasonable justification for the arrangement—i.e., a justification grounded in something other than the employer’s desire to maximize its advantage based on the perceived superiority of the judicial forum—such an agreement would not be unconscionable. Without such justification, we must assume that it is.</p>
<p class="indent">Applying these principles to the present case, we note the arbitration agreement was limited in scope to employee claims regarding wrongful termination. Although it did not expressly authorize litigation of the employer’s claims against the employee, as was the case in <span class="italic">Stirlen</span> and <span class="italic">Kinney,</span> such was the clear implication of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page420" class="pagebreak">420</span>agreement. Obviously, the lack of mutuality can be manifested as much by what the agreement does not provide as by what it does. (Cf. <span class="italic">24 Hour Fitness, Inc. v. Superior Court</span> (1998) [employee arbitration clause in personnel handbook found not to be unconscionable where it pertains to “‘any dispute aris[ing] from your employment’”].)</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that an arbitration clause must mandate the arbitration of all claims between employer and employee in order to avoid invalidation on grounds of unconscionability. Indeed, as the employer points out, the present arbitration agreement does not require arbitration of all conceivable claims that an employee might have against an employer, only wrongful termination claims. But an arbitration agreement imposed in an adhesive context lacks basic fairness and mutuality if it requires one contracting party, but not the other, to arbitrate all claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences. The arbitration agreement in this case lacks mutuality in this sense because it requires the arbitration of employee—but not employer—claims arising out of a wrongful termination. An employee terminated for stealing trade secrets, for example, must arbitrate his or her wrongful termination claim under the agreement while the employer has no corresponding obligation to arbitrate its trade secrets claim against the employee.</p>
<p class="indent">The unconscionable one-sidedness of the arbitration agreement is compounded in this case by the fact that it does not permit the full recovery of damages for employees, while placing no such restriction on the employer. Even if the limitation on FEHA damages is severed as contrary to public policy, the arbitration clause in the present case still does not permit full recovery of ordinary contract damages. The arbitration agreement specifies that damages are to be limited to the amount of backpay lost up until the time of arbitration. This provision excludes damages for prospective future earnings, so-called “front pay,” a common and often substantial component of contractual damages in a wrongful termination case. (See 4 Wilcox, Cal. Employment Law (2000) § 60.08 [b], p. 60-102 and [b][iii], p. 60-97.) The employer, on the other hand, is bound by no comparable limitation should it pursue a claim against its employees.</p>
<p class="indent">The employer in this case, as well as the Court of Appeal, claim the lack of mutuality was based on the realities of the employees’ place in the organizational hierarchy. As the Court of Appeal stated: “We … observe that the wording of the agreement most likely resulted from the employees’ position within the organization and may reflect the fact that the parties did not foresee the possibility of any dispute arising from employment that was not initiated by the employee. Plaintiffs were lower-level supervisory employees, without the sort of access to proprietary information or control over corporate finances that might lead to an employer suit against them.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page421" class="pagebreak">421</div>
<p class="indent">The fact that it is unlikely an employer will bring claims against a particular type of employee is not, ultimately, a justification for a unilateral arbitration agreement. It provides no reason for categorically exempting employer claims, however rare, from mandatory arbitration. Although an employer may be able, in a future case, to justify a unilateral arbitration agreement, the employer in the present case has not done so.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">E. Severability of Unconscionable Provisions</span></p>
<p class="indent">The employees contend that the presence of various unconscionable provisions or provisions contrary to public policy leads to the conclusion that the arbitration agreement as a whole cannot be enforced. The employer contends that, insofar as there are unconscionable provisions, they should be severed and the rest of the agreement enforced.</p>
<p class="indent">As noted, Civil Code section 1670.5, subdivision (a) provides that “[i]f the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.” Comment 2 of the Legislative Committee comment on section 1670.5, incorporating the comments from the Uniform Commercial Code, states: “Under this section the court, in its discretion, may refuse to enforce the contract as a whole if it is permeated by the unconscionability, or it may strike any single clause or group of clauses which are so tainted or which are contrary to the essential purpose of the agreement, or it may simply limit unconscionable clauses so as to avoid unconscionable results.”</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the statute appears to give a trial court some discretion as to whether to sever or restrict the unconscionable provision or whether to refuse to enforce the entire agreement. But it also appears to contemplate the latter course only when an agreement is “permeated” by unconscionability. We could discover no published cases in California that address directly the question of when a trial court abuses its discretion by refusing to enforce an entire agreement, as the trial court did in this case, nor precisely what it means for an agreement to be “permeated” by unconscionability. But there is a good deal of statutory and case law discussing the related question of when it is proper to sever <span class="italic">illegal</span> contract terms—a subject to which we will now turn.</p>
<p class="indent">Civil Code section 1598 states that “[w]here a contract has but a single object, and such object is unlawful, whether in whole or in part, or wholly impossible of performance, or so vaguely expressed as to be wholly unascertainable, the entire contract is void.” Section 1599 states that “[w]here a contract has several distinct objects, of which one at least is lawful, and one at least is unlawful, in whole or in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page422" class="pagebreak">422</span>part, the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.” In <span class="italic">Keene v. Harling</span> (1964), we elaborated on those provisions: “‘Whether a contract is entire or separable depends upon its language and subject matter, and this question is one of construction to be determined by the court according to the intention of the parties. If the contract is divisible, the first part may stand, although the latter is illegal. It has long been the rule in this state that ‘When the transaction is of such a nature that the good part of the consideration can be separated from that which is bad, the Courts will make the distinction, for the … law … [divides] according to common reason; and having made that void that is against law, lets the rest stand.’” ([S]ee also <span class="italic">Birbrower, Montalbano, Condon &amp; Frank v. Superior Court</span> (1998) [holding severable legal from illegal portions of attorney fee agreement].)</p>
<p class="indent">… Two reasons for severing or restricting illegal terms rather than voiding the entire contract appear implicit in case law. The first is to prevent parties from gaining undeserved benefit or suffering undeserved detriment as a result of voiding the entire agreement—particularly when there has been full or partial performance of the contract. Second, more generally, the doctrine of severance attempts to conserve a contractual relationship if to do so would not be condoning an illegal scheme. The overarching inquiry is whether “‘the interests of justice … would be furthered’” by severance. (<span class="italic">Beynon v. Garden Grove Medical Group</span> (1980)). Moreover, courts must have the <span class="italic">capacity</span> to cure the unlawful contract through severance or restriction of the offending clause, which, as discussed below, is not invariably the case.</p>
<p class="indent">The basic principles of severability that emerge from Civil Code section 1599 and the case law of illegal contracts appear fully applicable to the doctrine of unconscionability. Courts are to look to the various purposes of the contract. If the central purpose of the contract is tainted with illegality, then the contract as a whole cannot be enforced. If the illegality is collateral to the main purpose of the contract, and the illegal provision can be extirpated from the contract by means of severance or restriction, then such severance and restriction are appropriate. That Civil Code section 1670.5 follows this basic model is suggested by the Legislative Committee comment quoted above, which talks in terms of contracts not being enforced if “permeated” by unconscionability, and of clauses being severed if “so tainted or … contrary to the essential purpose of the agreement.” (Leg. Com. com., <span class="italic">supra</span>).</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, two factors weigh against severance of the unlawful provisions. First, the arbitration agreement contains more than one unlawful provision; it has both an unlawful damages provision and an unconscionably unilateral arbitration clause. Such multiple defects indicate a systematic effort to impose arbitration on an employee not simply as an alternative to litigation, but as an inferior forum that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page423" class="pagebreak">423</span>works to the employer’s advantage. In other words, given the multiple unlawful provisions, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the arbitration agreement is permeated by an unlawful purpose.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_82" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-82" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Second, in the case of the agreement’s lack of mutuality, such permeation is indicated by the fact that there is no single provision a court can strike or restrict in order to remove the unconscionable taint from the agreement. Rather, the court would have to, in effect, reform the contract, not through severance or restriction, but by augmenting it with additional terms. Civil Code section 1670.5 does not authorize such reformation by augmentation, nor does the arbitration statute. Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 authorizes the court to refuse arbitration if grounds for revocation exist, not to reform the agreement to make it lawful. Nor do courts have any such power under their inherent, limited authority to reform contracts. Because a court is unable to cure this unconscionability through severance or restriction, and is not permitted to cure it through reformation and augmentation, it must void the entire agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">… The approach described above is consistent with our holding in <span class="italic">Scissor-Tail.</span> In that case, we found an arbitration agreement to be unconscionable because the agreement provided for an arbitrator likely to be biased in favor of the party imposing the agreement. We nonetheless recognized that “[t]he parties have indeed agreed to arbitrate” and that there is a “strong public policy of this state in favor of resolving disputes by arbitration.” (<span class="italic">Ibid.</span>) The court found a way out of this dilemma through the CAA, specifically Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.6, which provides in part: “If the arbitration agreement does not provide a method for appointing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page424" class="pagebreak">424</span>an arbitrator, the parties to the agreement who seek arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought may agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator and that method shall be followed. In the absence of an agreed method, or if the agreed method fails or for any reason cannot be followed, or when an arbitrator appointed fails to act and his or her successor has not been appointed, the court, on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement, shall appoint the arbitrator.” Citing this provision, the court stated: “We therefore conclude that upon remand the trial court should afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to agree on a suitable arbitrator and, failing such agreement, the court should on petition of either party appoint the arbitrator.” Other cases, both before and after <span class="italic">Scissor-Tail,</span> have also held that the part of an arbitration clause providing for a less-than-neutral arbitration forum is severable from the rest of the clause.</p>
<p class="indent">… The employer also points to two cases in which unconscionably one-sided provisions in arbitration agreements were severed and the agreement enforced. <span class="italic">Saika,</span> as discussed, involved an arbitration agreement with a provision that would make the arbitration nonbinding if the arbitration award were $25,000 or greater. In <span class="italic">Beynon v. Garden Grove Medical Group</span>, a provision of the arbitration agreement gave one party, but not the other, the option of rejecting the arbitrator’s decision. The courts in both instances concluded, in <span class="italic">Saika</span> implicitly, in <span class="italic">Beynon</span> explicitly, that the offending clause was severable from the rest of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">The provisions in these two cases are different from the one-sided arbitration provision at issue in this case in at least two important respects. First, the one-sidedness in the above two cases was confined to single provisions regarding the rights of the parties after an arbitration award was made, not a provision affecting the scope of the arbitration. As such, the unconscionability could be cured by severing the unlawful provisions. Second, in both cases, the arguments against severance were made by the party that had imposed the unconscionable provision in order to prevent enforcement of an arbitration award against it, and the failure to sever would have had the effect of accomplishing the precise unlawful purpose of that provision—the invalidation of the arbitration award. As discussed, courts will generally sever illegal provisions and enforce a contract when nonenforcement will lead to an undeserved benefit or detriment to one of the parties that would not further the interests of justice. In <span class="italic">Beynon</span> and <span class="italic">Saika,</span> the interests of justice would obviously not have been furthered by nonenforcement. The same considerations are not found in the present case.</p>

<p class="indent">The line between fraudulent misrepresentation and legitimate sales talk is often a thin one. How naive can a buyer legitimately claim to be? Does a seller have to disclose all of the weaknesses in his product when he is trying to make a sale or only give honest answers to a customer’s questions? The line has been blurred even more as legal liability has expanded from cases of deliberate and knowing falsehood with intent to deceive, to statements not known to be false in which the utterer was negligent in not discovering their falsity, to innocent misrepresentation by statements which the utterer reasonably believed true but which are false. In this progression the laws of misrepresentation and fraud blend into concepts of warranty and liability for goods that fail to meet description.</p>
<p class="indent">A variety of distinctions are made in describing the difference we all feel between selling and swindling, between puffing and lying. Some distinctions are made between representations of fact and promises or between facts and opinions. Different kinds of sellers are burdened with different levels of responsibility along the following spectrum:</p>
<p class="indent">a. <span class="italic">Caveat Emptor.</span> It is the buyer’s job to examine the goods and ask questions and the seller’s job to sell. It is a normal part of market behavior for sellers to exaggerate, puff, and leave out unpleasant bits of information, even if that makes what is said misleading.</p>
<p class="indent">b. <span class="italic">The Duty to Give an Honest Answer.</span> A seller is not permitted to lie and must believe that what he tells the buyer is correct, but the seller is not liable if it turns out to be wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">c. <span class="italic">The Duty to Give an Accurate Answer.</span> A seller must be correct in what is said but is under no obligation to volunteer information.</p>
<p class="indent">d. <span class="italic">The Duty to Give a Complete Answer.</span> A seller is obligated to give truthful and complete answers to questions asked but need not point out matters not raised by the buyer.</p>
<p class="indent">e. <span class="italic">The Duty to Disclose.</span> A seller is obligated to disclose, without need for an inquiry, relevant information known to it that might bear on the buyer’s decision.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page427" class="pagebreak">427</div>
<p class="indent">f. <span class="italic">The Duty to Investigate.</span> A seller is obliged to conduct a complete and accurate investigation and to disclose fully all material information without being asked by the buyer.</p>
<p class="indent">Note the extent to which it makes a difference to you whether buyer and seller are:</p>
<p class="indent">a. people in the same line of business.</p>
<p class="indent">b. both merchants, although not necessarily in the same trade.</p>
<p class="indent">c. consumers.</p>
<p class="indent">d. gullible, simple people with no business experience.</p>
<p class="indent">Also note the difference it makes to you whether the object being bought and sold is:</p>
<p class="indent">a. a used car.</p>
<p class="indent">b. a painting or object of art.</p>
<p class="indent">c. a diamond.</p>

<p class="indent">When the parties are so situated that the buyer may reasonably rely upon the expression of the seller’s opinion, it is no excuse to give a false one. And so it makes much difference whether the parties stand “on an equality.” For example, we should treat very differently the expressed opinion of a chemist to a layman about the properties of a composition from the same opinion between chemist and chemist, when the buyer had full opportunity to examine. The reason of the rule lies, we think, in this: There are some kinds of talk which no sensible man takes seriously, and if he does he suffers from his credulity. If we were all scrupulously honest, it would not be so; but, as it is, neither party usually believes what the seller says about his own opinions, and each knows it. Such statements, like the claims of campaign managers before election, are rather designed to allay the suspicion which would attend their absence than to be understood as having any relation to objective truth. It is quite true that they induce a compliant temper in the buyer, but it is by a much more subtle process than through the acceptance of his claims for his wares.</p>

<p id="sec189" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Stambovsky v. Ackley</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1991.</p>
<p class="sectionb">169 A.D.2d 254, 572 N.Y.S.2d 672.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ R<small>UBIN</small>, J. Plaintiff, to his horror, discovered that the house he had recently contracted to purchase was widely reputed to be possessed by poltergeists, reportedly seen by defendant seller and members of her family on numerous occasions over the last nine years. Plaintiff promptly commenced this action seeking rescission of the contract of sale. Supreme Court reluctantly dismissed the complaint, holding that plaintiff has no remedy at law in this jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="indent">The unusual facts of this case, as disclosed by the record, clearly warrant a grant of equitable relief to the buyer who, as a resident of New York City, cannot be expected to have any familiarity with the folklore of the Village of Nyack. Not being a “local,” plaintiff could not readily learn that the home he had contracted to purchase is haunted. Whether the source of the spectral apparitions seen by defendant seller are parapsychic or psychogenic, having reported their presence in both a national publication (<span class="italic">Readers’ Digest</span>) and the local press (in 1977 and 1982, respectively), defendant is estopped to deny their existence and, as a matter of law, the house is haunted. More to the point, however, no divination is required to conclude that it is defendant’s promotional efforts in publicizing her close encounters with these spirits which fostered the home’s reputation in the community. In 1989, the house was included in a five-home walking tour of Nyack and described in a November 27th newspaper article as “a riverfront Victorian (with ghost).” The impact of the reputation thus created goes to the very essence of the bargain between the parties, greatly impairing both the value of the property and its potential for resale. The extent of this impairment may be presumed for the purpose of reviewing the disposition of this motion to dismiss the cause of action for rescission and represents merely an issue of fact for resolution at trial.</p>
<p class="indent">While I agree with [the trial court] that the real estate broker, as agent for the seller, is under no duty to disclose to a potential buyer the phantasmal reputation of the premises and that, in his pursuit of a legal remedy for fraudulent misrepresentation against the seller, plaintiff hasn’t a ghost of a chance, I am nevertheless moved by the spirit of equity to allow the buyer to seek rescission of the contract of sale and recovery of his downpayment. New York law fails to recognize any remedy for damages incurred as a result of the seller’s mere silence, applying instead the strict rule of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span>. Therefore, the theoretical basis for granting relief, even under the extraordinary facts of this case, is elusive if not ephemeral.</p>

<p class="indent">From the perspective of a person in the position of plaintiff herein, a very practical problem arises with respect to the discovery of a paranormal phenomenon: “Who you gonna’ call?” as the title song to the movie <span class="italic">Ghostbusters</span> asks. Applying the strict rule of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span> to a contract involving a house possessed by poltergeists conjures up visions of a psychic or medium routinely accompanying the structural engineer and Terminix man on an inspection of every home subject to a contract of sale. It portends that the prudent attorney will establish an escrow account lest the subject of the transaction come back to haunt him and his client—or pray that his malpractice insurance coverage extends to supernatural disasters. In the interest of avoiding such untenable consequences, the notion that a haunting is a condition which can and should be ascertained upon reasonable inspection of the premises is a hobgoblin which should be exorcised from the body of legal precedent and laid quietly to rest.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been suggested by a leading authority that the ancient rule which holds that mere non-disclosure does not constitute actionable misrepresentation “finds proper application in cases where the fact undisclosed is patent, or the plaintiff has equal opportunities for obtaining information which he may be expected to utilize, or the defendant has no reason to think that he is acting under any misapprehension” (Prosser, Law of Torts § 106, at 696 [4th ed., 1971]). However, with respect to transactions in real estate, New York adheres to the doctrine of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span> and imposes no duty upon the vendor to disclose any information concerning the premises unless there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties or some conduct on the part of the seller which constitutes “active concealment.” Normally, some affirmative misrepresentation or partial disclosure is required to impose upon the seller a duty to communicate undisclosed conditions affecting the premises.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Caveat emptor</span> is not so all-encompassing a doctrine of common law as to render every act of non-disclosure immune from redress, whether legal or equitable. “In regard to the necessity of giving information which has not been asked, the rule differs somewhat at law and in equity, and while the law courts would permit no recovery of damages against a vendor, because of mere concealment of facts under certain circumstances, yet if the vendee refused to complete the contract because of the concealment of a material fact on the part of the other, equity would refuse to compel him so to do, because equity only compels the specific performance of a contract which is fair and open, and in regard to which all material matters known to each have been communicated to the other.” Even as a principle of law, long before exceptions were embodied in statute law, the doctrine was held inapplicable to contagion among animals, adulteration of food, and insolvency of a maker of a promissory note and of a tenant substituted for another under a lease. Common law is not moribund. <span class="italic">Ex facto jus oritur</span> (law arises out of facts). Where fairness and common <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page430" class="pagebreak">430</span>sense dictate that an exception should be created, the evolution of the law should not be stifled by rigid application of a legal maxim.</p>
<p class="indent">The doctrine of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span> requires that a buyer act prudently to assess the fitness and value of his purchase and operates to bar the purchaser who fails to exercise due care from seeking the equitable remedy of rescission. For the purposes of the instant motion to dismiss the action pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), plaintiff is entitled to every favorable inference which may reasonably be drawn from the pleadings, specifically, in this instance, that he met his obligation to conduct an inspection of the premises and a search of available public records with respect to title. It should be apparent, however, that the most meticulous inspection and the search would not reveal the presence of poltergeists at the premises or unearth the property’s ghoulish reputation in the community. Therefore, there is no sound policy reason to deny plaintiff relief for failing to discover a state of affairs which the most prudent purchaser would not be expected to even contemplate.</p>
<p class="indent">The case law in this jurisdiction dealing with the duty of a vendor of real property to disclose information to the buyer is distinguishable from the matter under review. The most salient distinction is that existing cases invariably deal with the physical condition of the premises, defects in title, liens against the property, expenses or income and other factors affecting its operation. No case has been brought to this court’s attention in which the property value was impaired as the result of the reputation created by information disseminated to the public by the seller (or, for that matter, as a result of possession by poltergeists).</p>
<p class="indent">Where a condition which has been created by the seller materially impairs the value of the contract and is peculiarly within the knowledge of the seller or unlikely to be discovered by a prudent purchaser exercising due care with respect to the subject transaction, nondisclosure constitutes a basis for rescission as a matter of equity. Any other outcome places upon the buyer not merely the obligation to exercise care in his purchase but rather to be omniscient with respect to any fact which may affect the bargain. No practical purpose is served by imposing such a burden upon a purchaser. To the contrary, it encourages predatory business practice and offends the principle that equity will suffer no wrong to be without a remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s contention that the contract of sale, particularly the merger or “as is” clause, bars recovery of the buyer’s deposit is unavailing. Even an express disclaimer will not be given effect where the facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the party invoking it. Moreover, a fair reading of the merger clause reveals that it expressly disclaims only representations made with respect to the physical condition of the premises and merely makes general reference to representations concerning “any other matter or things affecting or relating to the aforesaid premises.” As broad as this language may be, a reasonable interpretation is that its effect is limited <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page431" class="pagebreak">431</span>to tangible or physical matters and does not extend to paranormal phenomena. Finally, if the language of the contract is to be construed as broadly as defendant urges to encompass the presence of poltergeists in the house, it cannot be said that she has delivered the premises “vacant” in accordance with her obligation under the provisions of the contract rider.</p>
<p class="indent">To the extent New York law may be said to require something more than “mere concealment” to apply even the equitable remedy of rescission, the case of <span class="italic">Junius Construction Corporation v. Cohen</span>, while not precisely on point, provides some guidance. In that case, the seller disclosed that an official map indicated two as yet unopened streets which were planned for construction at the edges of the parcel. What was not disclosed was that the same map indicated a third street which, if opened, would divide the plot in half. The court held that, while the seller was under no duty to mention the planned streets at all, having undertaken to disclose two of them, he was obliged to reveal the third.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case at bar, defendant seller deliberately fostered the public belief that her home was possessed. Having undertaken to inform the public at large, to whom she has no legal relationship, about the supernatural occurrences on her property, she may be said to owe no less a duty to her contract vendee. It has been remarked that the occasional modern cases which permit a seller to take unfair advantage of a buyer’s ignorance so long as he is not actively misled are “singularly unappetizing” (Prosser, Law of Torts § 106, at 696 [4th ed. 1971]). Where, as here, the seller not only takes unfair advantage of the buyer’s ignorance but has created and perpetuated a condition about which he is unlikely to even inquire, enforcement of the contract (in whole or in part) is offensive to the court’s sense of equity. Application of the remedy of rescission, within the bounds of the narrow exception to the doctrine of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span> set forth herein, is entirely appropriate to relieve the unwitting purchaser from the consequences of a most unnatural bargain.</p>

<p class="indent">I would affirm the dismissal of the complaint by the motion court.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff seeks to rescind his contract to purchase defendant Ackley’s residential property and recover his down payment. Plaintiff alleges that Ackley and her real estate broker, defendant Ellis Realty, made material misrepresentations of the property in that they failed to disclose that Ackley believed that the house was haunted by poltergeists. Moreover, Ackley shared this belief with her community and the general public through articles published in <span class="italic">Reader’s Digest</span> (1977) and the local newspaper (1982). In November 1989, approximately two months after the parties entered into the contract of sale but subsequent to the scheduled October 2, 1989 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page432" class="pagebreak">432</span>closing, the house was included in a five-house walking tour and again described in the local newspaper as being haunted.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to closing, plaintiff learned of this reputation and unsuccessfully sought to rescind the $650,000 contract of sale and obtain return of his $32,500 down payment without resort to litigation. The plaintiff then commenced this action for that relief and alleged that he would not have entered into the contract had he been so advised and that as a result of the alleged poltergeist activity, the market value and resaleability of the property was greatly diminished. Defendant Ackley has counterclaimed for specific performance.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It is settled law in New York that the seller of real property is under no duty to speak when the parties deal at arm’s length. The mere silence of the seller, without some act or conduct which deceived the purchaser, does not amount to a concealment that is actionable as a fraud. The buyer has the duty to satisfy himself as to the quality of his bargain pursuant to the doctrine of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span>, which in New York State still applies to real estate transactions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">London v. Courduff</span> (1988).</p>
<p class="indent">The parties herein were represented by counsel and dealt at arm’s length. This is evidenced by the contract of sale which, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, contained various riders and a specific provision that all prior understandings and agreements between the parties were merged into the contract, that the contract completely expressed their full agreement and that neither had relied upon any statement by anyone else not set forth in the contract. There is no allegation that defendants, by some specific act, other than the failure to speak, deceived the plaintiff. Nevertheless, a cause of action may be sufficiently stated where there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship creating a duty to disclose and there was a failure to disclose a material fact, calculated to induce a false belief. However, plaintiff herein has not alleged and there is [a] basis for concluding that a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between these parties to an arm’s length transaction such as to give rise to a duty to disclose. In addition, there is no allegation that defendants thwarted plaintiff’s efforts to fulfill his responsibilities fixed by the doctrine of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span>. Finally, if the doctrine of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span> is to be discarded, it should be for a reason more substantive than a poltergeist. The existence of a poltergeist is no more binding upon the defendants than it is upon this court.</p>
<p id="sec190" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Do Justices Rubin and Smith agree on the meaning of <span class="italic">caveat emptor?</span> The meaning of <span class="italic">caveat emptor</span> is unclear, beyond its basic sense that the risk of defects in the property or the seller’s title, except to the extent expressly represented on warranted to the contrary, are placed on buyers. Both judges acknowledge that it is the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page433" class="pagebreak">433</span>law of New York for the purchase of real estate. Of what need the buyer beware? Would the buyer’s claim for return of the down payment because of misrepresentation be stronger if seller had affirmatively stated “There are no ghosts around here”? If seller had arranged for the ghosts to vacate during the period the buyer is inspecting, would that be fraud? If the buyer retained an exorcist who failed to detect ghosts the seller has often encountered, would Justice Smith leave the risk entirely with the buyer? If the seller had been aware that there was a dangerous accumulation of radon gas in the basement that can cause fatal ailments to occupants of the house, but buyer’s inspection failed to disclose the problem, would Justice Smith approve of the seller keeping silent?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The procedural setting of this case on appeal is somewhat unusual. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding no issues of fact requiring trial. Buyer’s allegation that the house was reputedly haunted and that this condition adversely affects its resale value therefore must be accepted as true. How might buyer prove these matters at trial?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. As a matter of common sense, and ignoring almost a thousand years of history, do you think that a lesser burden of proof should be imposed on a buyer who wishes to call a deal off and obtain return of the down payment than should be demanded of the same buyer when seeking to recover damages from the seller because of the misrepresentation by silence? Should these burdens be different from that imposed on the seller who seeks to obtain a judicial order directing the buyer to specifically perform the contract by buying the property?</p>

<p id="sec191" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Cushman v. Kirby</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Vermont Supreme Court, 1987.</p>
<p class="sectionb">148 Vt. 571, 536 A.2d 550.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ D<small>OOLEY</small>, J. This is an appeal by the defendants-sellers of a home from a judgment entered, after a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs-buyers, in a suit for misrepresentation. We affirm.</p>
<p class="indent">In the spring of 1984, the plaintiffs, Lynn and Julie Cushman, entered into negotiations with the defendants, Gregory and Elizabeth Kirby, for the purchase of a single-family home in the Town of Waltham. After viewing the premises on two occasions, and agreeing on a purchase price of $102,500, the parties executed a purchase and sale agreement in April, 1984. The real property was conveyed by defendants to plaintiffs on June 12, 1984, for the agreed upon price.</p>
<p class="indent">Two months later, plaintiffs brought an action for misrepresentation claiming defendants had, during the course of negotiations, represented that there was good <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page434" class="pagebreak">434</span>quality well water available on the land suitable for all household uses, when in fact the available well water was not of good quality. Trial by jury resulted in a verdict for plaintiffs in the amount of $6,600….</p>
<p class="indent">… Through the offices of a realtor, plaintiffs briefly viewed the property once in the summer of 1983, and again in March of 1984. During the second visit, which was a much more thorough tour of the house, they discovered an apparatus for a water treatment system in the basement. Since the apparatus was labelled “water conditioner,” plaintiffs inquired from defendants: “What kind of water do you have?” Mrs. Kirby answered: “It’s good. It’s fine. It’s a little hard, but the system downstairs takes care of it.” Mr. Kirby, who was present during this exchange, remained silent. Satisfied with the representation that the water was simply hard, plaintiffs inquired no further about water quality.</p>
<p class="indent">While moving into the home after closing, plaintiffs first discovered that the well water was in fact sulfur water that smelled strongly of rotten eggs. Dismayed by this discovery, plaintiffs contacted Mrs. Kirby, who responded by stating that she forgot to tell plaintiffs that the basement water treatment system needed “Clorox.” She said that when the “Clorox” level is too low, the water smells and tastes bad.</p>
<p class="indent">Following Mrs. Kirby’s instruction, plaintiffs added “Clorox” to the system. Rather than solving the problem, the “Clorox” made the water taste like sulfur and chlorine. They then consulted a plumber, who confirmed that they had sulfur water, and explained that sulfur water is not the same as hard water. The plumber testified that hard water is a condition caused by calcium, which does not require treatment for drinking, or cause foul taste or smell, as does sulfur water. The plumber also informed plaintiffs that it would cost at least $1,000 to rehabilitate the existing system—exclusive of labor, regular maintenance, and repair costs. He also testified that even with a properly operating system, the end result would be treated sulfur water, which even defendants testified would bring the water only to a “tolerable level of drinkability.”</p>
<p class="indent">Based on advice from their plumber, as well as information received from other people who were not satisfied with similar sulfur filtration systems, plaintiffs determined that the most cost-effective, long-term solution to their sulfur water problem was to join with two other neighbors and hookup to the Vergennes city water supply. Thereafter, they accomplished the hookup for a cost of approximately $5,000, plus annual water bills.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants’ first argument is that, because of the absence of any evidence that either defendant made any affirmative misrepresentation to plaintiffs concerning water quality, the trial court erroneously denied their motions for directed verdicts. The premise of this argument is that the legal standard applicable to their conduct <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page435" class="pagebreak">435</span>requires that they must have made intentional misrepresentations of existing fact before either of them could be held liable for fraud. We disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">This Court stated in <span class="italic">Crompton v. Beedle</span> that: Where one has full information and represents that he has, if he discloses a part of his information only, and by words or conduct leads the one with whom he contracts to believe that he has made a full disclosure and does this with intent to deceive and overreach and to prevent investigation, he is guilty of fraud against which equity will relieve, if his words and conduct in consequence of reliance upon them bring about the result which he desires. We think that, regardless of whether Mrs. Kirby’s statement was actually false, and known by her to be false when it was made, the standard of conduct applicable to her was that stated in <span class="italic">Crompton</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">On review of the propriety of a denial of a directed verdict, this Court will view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, exclusive of any modifying evidence….</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Kirby testified that at the time of the sale to the Cushmans, she was aware that the well water on the property contained sulfur to an extent requiring treatment to make it of tolerable quality. It was also uncontroverted that, despite her knowledge of the presence of sulfur in the water, Mrs. Kirby represented to the Cushmans, in response to inquiries about water quality, that the water on the property was “a little hard,” but that the water treatment equipment in the basement would take care of it. There was no evidence that either defendant ever disclosed the presence of sulfur in the water. The plaintiffs testified that they relied on the truth of Mrs. Kirby’s statements about the extent of the water problem when they decided to buy the house.</p>
<p class="indent">This evidence makes out a case of actionable fraud, under the standard of <span class="italic">Crompton</span>, sufficient to carry the case to the jury. It follows that it was not error to deny Mrs. Kirby’s motion for directed verdict.</p>
<p class="indent">A somewhat different standard of conduct applies to Mr. Kirby, however, since he made no affirmative representations to plaintiffs about the quality of water. The claim for fraud against him was based exclusively on his silence while in the company of plaintiffs and Mrs. Kirby when she made the statements about water quality referred to above.</p>
<p class="indent">“Silence alone is insufficient to constitute fraud unless there is a duty to speak.” <span class="italic">Cheever v. Albro</span> (1980). In <span class="italic">Cheever</span>, we concluded that the party sued for fraud had such a duty to speak based on “superior knowledge and means of knowledge” over the plaintiff, as well as certain contract language relevant to the disputed transaction. Although <span class="italic">Cheever</span> involved the sale of a corporation, rather than real estate, we think that a duty to speak based on the superior knowledge of a seller is equally present where the relationship of the parties is that of vendor and purchaser of real <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page436" class="pagebreak">436</span>estate. As stated by one court: Where material facts are accessible to the vendor only, and he knows them not to be within the reach of the diligent attention, observation and judgment of the purchaser, the vendor [of real estate] is bound to disclose such facts and make them known to the purchaser.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Kirby testified that he was aware of the sulfur in the water at the time of the sale. He also testified that he had assisted in maintaining the water treatment system, that he had a working knowledge of the system, and that he understood the system was designed to treat sulfur in the water. Thus, by his own testimony, Mr. Kirby was fully cognizant of the quality of the water, and no question of fact existed as to his state of mind regarding this issue. Mr. Kirby further testified that he heard Mrs. Kirby represent to the plaintiffs that the water equipment took care of the “hard water” problem. As such, the only question of fact at issue with respect to Mr. Kirby’s liability was whether his wife’s representation constituted fraud. This is because if Mrs. Kirby’s statement amounted to an inadequate disclosure constituting a misrepresentation, then, Mr. Kirby, based on his own knowledge, and his position as a seller of the property, had an affirmative duty to speak. This duty existed as a matter of law. The jury found Mrs. Kirby’s statement to be a misrepresentation. Given the resolution of this sole factual issue, in conjunction with his own testimony, Mr. Kirby had a duty to speak, yet he remained silent. Under the circumstances of the present case, this silence constituted a misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Kirby’s liability hinged on the determination of the factual issue of whether Mrs. Kirby’s representation to the plaintiffs amounted to a misrepresentation, which was a question clearly within the province of the jury. Therefore, the trial court correctly denied Mr. Kirby’s motion for directed verdict.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">* * *</span></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants’ remaining argument is that the court’s instruction on damages was erroneous. Defendants requested that the court instruct that plaintiffs were entitled to recover at most the cost of repairs to the treatment system. Instead, the court charged that it is a jury question whether repairs to the treatment system would fully and adequately accomplish the goal of placing plaintiffs in the same position in which they would have been had the property been sold as represented—with good quality water. If so, the court charged, the measure of damages suggested by defendants would be the maximum recovery. If not, the proper measure of damages is the difference in value of the property as represented and the value of the property as it actually existed.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, a party seeking damages for fraud is entitled to “recover such damages … as will compensate him for the loss or injury actually sustained and place him <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page437" class="pagebreak">437</span>in the same position that he would have occupied had he not been defrauded.” <span class="italic">Larochelle v. Komery</span> (1969). The precise measure of damages that will provide the defrauded party with the benefit of his bargain, however, depends on “the facts and circumstances surrounding the fraud, and the nature and extent of the injury suffered by the defrauded party.”</p>
<p class="indent">If the injury is temporary in the sense that restoration can cure the harm, the reasonable cost of repair may serve the need and provide adequate and fair compensation. If the damage is permanent and beyond full repair, the variance in value of the property before and after the injury often affords the better guide to a just award. It all depends upon the character of the property and the nature and extent of the injury. The court’s charge appropriately tracked the rule… Furthermore, there was ample evidence in the record to support the jury’s conclusion that the fraud in this case could not be adequately remedied by repair of the water treatment system. The court’s damage instruction was not error, and the damage award must stand.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec192" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Didn’t the Cushmans have an opportunity to turn on the tap and taste the water or to hire an expert home inspector to smell it for them? Put yourself in the kitchen with the Kirbys and Cushmans. Ms. Kirby has just said that when the system isn’t working right the water tastes and smells bad. Wouldn’t that arouse your curiosity enough to ask her if she had a spare glass so you could try it out?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The problem in this case could be cured effectively by hooking up to the city water system for $5,000. Would you be as comfortable with this result if three water experts had testified that the only way to deal with this problem would be either to install a fancy reverse osmosis distillation system for $75,000 or to bring in city water at a roughly equivalent net present value cost?</p>

<h3 id="sec193" class="section"><span class="bold">V.    M<small>ISUNDERSTANDING AND</small> M<small>ISTAKE</small></span></h3>
<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">If a party to a contract is mistaken as to what the other party is offering to buy or sell, it is easy to say that she should not be held to her promise because she really never consented to the deal she appears to have made. But the term <span class="italic">mistake</span> can cover a bewilderingly diverse conglomeration of fact situations with very different legal significance. How can we distinguish between the cases in which the contract <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page438" class="pagebreak">438</span>should be enforced, even if it proves to be a bad bargain for one party who claims she made a mistake, and those cases in which her performance should be excused? It is safe to say that the law’s answer to this question is very garbled. Mistake is one of the most confused and puzzling areas of contract law, but a faint path through the morass can be discerned.</p>
<p class="indent">(1) <span class="italic">Mistake in Business Judgment.</span> One of the parties to almost every contract can, after the fact, be said to have made a mistake in judgment. Contract is a tool for bargain and exchange, and every sale involves a guess by each party as to the value of what he is bargaining for. Not infrequently, then, a month after the exchange one of the parties will think he made a good deal, and the other will think he made a mistake in selling so cheaply or in paying so much. Obviously, this alone does not excuse performance.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) <span class="italic">Mistake in Integration.</span> In other cases, the parties reach an agreement, but it goes astray in the process of writing it down. A slip of the tongue, or carelessness in typing up the agreement, may result in a writing that does not reflect the understanding. The law governing these cases is clear; the parties have a contract, albeit imperfectly expressed. The remedy for this kind of mistake, once a court is convinced that a scrivener’s error has occurred, is to reform the contract to express accurately the intention of the parties.</p>

<p id="sec194" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Stare v. Tate</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Court of Appeal, 1971.</p>
<p class="sectionb">21 Cal.App.3d 432, 98 Cal.Rptr. 264.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ K<small>AUS</small>, P.J. Plaintiff appeals from an adverse judgment in an action to reform a property settlement agreement with her former husband, the defendant, and to enforce the agreement as reformed.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">F<small>ACTS</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The agreement in question was signed by both parties on February 21, 1968. It was the culmination of protracted negotiations which had been going on for several years. Both sides were represented by counsel at all times.</p>
<p class="indent">In the negotiations both sides apparently agreed that the community property was to be evenly divided. They did not agree, however, on the value of certain items and on the community property status of certain stocks which stood in the husband’s name alone.</p>
<p class="indent">These disagreements centered principally on items which, it was understood, were to be retained by the husband.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page439" class="pagebreak">439</div>
<p class="indent">In particular the wife, Joan, had an <span class="italic">idée fixe</span> that certain real property (the “Holt” property) which she and the husband, Tim, owned as tenants in common with his brother, was worth $550,000. The husband’s valuation was somewhere between $425,000 and $450,000. Joan had very little evidence on which to base her contention: First, there was a statement by Tim’s parents when they had owned the property that it was worth about $550,000; second, a former attorney of Tim’s had, in 1966, written a letter to Joan’s attorney which contained a settlement offer based upon a value of $550,000.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_83" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-83" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The second important area of disagreement centered on the ownership of stock in a family corporation and the proper basis for its valuation. In all Tim owned 25,500 shares. Of these he had owned 5000 shares long before he married Joan. Joan realized that any claim that these 5000 shares were community property was tenuous, at best. Similarly, on his part, Tim conceded that a block of 7500 shares was community property. Another block of 5000 shares was, according to Joan, given to her and Tim as a wedding present by his parents. Yet another block of 8000 shares was, again according to Joan, given to both her and Tim as a present during their marriage. The shares were, however, in Tim’s name alone and he denied that the community had any interest in them.</p>
<p class="indent">The book value of the shares was a little less than $7.00 per share. Joan claimed that the fair market value was, however, $1.50 per share over the book value and that Tim should “buy” her community interest in the shares at that value.</p>
<p class="indent">To sum up: If Joan was correct with respect to the value of the Holt property, her community property interest in it was about $25,000 higher than Tim conceded; if she were to succeed on her contentions with respect to the stock, Tim would have had to pay her roughly $40,000 more than he was willing.</p>
<p class="indent">In January 1968, Joan’s attorney prepared a document entitled “SECOND PROPOSAL FOR A BASIS OF SETTLEMENT—TATE v. TATE” which, among other things, arrived at a suggested figure of $70,081.85 for the value of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page440" class="pagebreak">440</span>Joan’s share in the Holt property. This value was arrived at by a computation set forth in the proposal. It is copied in the footnote.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_84" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-84" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">It is obvious that Joan’s attorney arrived at the figure of $70,081.85 for the community equity in the property only by making two substantial errors. First, the net value after deducting the encumbrances from the asserted gross value of $550,000 is $241,637.01, not $141,637.01; second, one-half of $241,637.01 is substantially more than $70,081.85. The correct figure for the equity should have been $120,818.50 or, roughly $50,000 more.</p>
<p class="indent">The mistake did not escape Tim’s accountant who discovered it while helping Tim’s attorney in preparing a counter-offer. He brought it to the attention of the attorney who, in his own words, reacted as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">I told him that I had been arguing with [the wife’s attorney] to use the value that was on the—on the real property tax statement, but I knew that that was low and [he] would never go for it, that the appraisal had been $425,000.00 when the building had been purchased by said owners, and I thought that until we got it, that we would use something like a $450,000.00 value, and he said, ‘Fine.’ It is my recollection that I said to him, ‘You know, you might as well use the figure that Walker has there because his mistake is a hundred thousand dollars and we value it at a hundred thousand dollars less, so it is basically the same thing, so give it a $70,000.00 equity,’ and that is what he did and that is how it came about.</p>
<p class="indent">A counter-offer was then submitted to Joan and her lawyer. It lists all of the community assets, with the property in question being valued at $70,082.00, rounding up the erroneous figure in Joan’s offer to the nearest dollar. There can be no reasonable doubt that the counter-offer was prepared in a way designed to minimize the danger that Joan or her attorney would discover the mistake. While all other encumbered properties are listed at an agreed gross value, with encumbrances shown as a deduction therefrom, the only figure that appears next to the Holt property is the equity!</p>
<p class="indent">The counter-offer said nothing about attorneys’ fees. One of its terms was that Joan would assume a note of not quite $11,000. It was based on only 7500 shares of the family corporation’s stock being community property and a valuation at book. In other words, it represented a demand for total surrender by Joan on the two major items in dispute.</p>

<p class="indent">Based on the figures in the counter-offer Tim would have received substantially more in assets than Joan. This difference was to be made up by a cash payment of $46,534.</p>
<p class="indent">On February 16, 1968, the parties and their attorneys had a settlement conference. The counter-offer was the basis for the discussion. There was no mention that the figure of $70,082 for the equity in the Holt property was based on an agreed value of $550,000 or any other figure. In the discussion it was agreed that the husband was to assume the liability on the $11,000.00 note and was to pay Joan’s attorney $7,500, a figure somewhat smaller than counsel’s time charges up till then. The result of all this give and take was that the cash payment from Tim to Joan was to be reduced to $40,000.</p>
<p class="indent">A few days later a formal agreement was signed. It simply recites who was to get what, without ascribing any value to any of the properties. It also provides for the $40,000 cash payment. Sometime in March 1968, Joan obtained a divorce.</p>
<p class="indent">The mistake might never have come to light had not Tim desired to have that exquisite last word. A few days after Joan had obtained the divorce he mailed her a copy of the offer which contained the errant computation. On top of the page he wrote with evident satisfaction: “PLEASE NOTE $100,000.00 MISTAKE IN YOUR FIGURES. * * *” The present action was filed exactly one month later.</p>
<p class="indent">Tim testified that he did not learn of the arithmetical error until after the property settlement agreement was signed. The record contains no evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">There is really no substantial conflict in the evidence and it is hard to understand how the trial court could do anything but grant Joan’s prayer for relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 3399 of the Civil Code provides: “When, through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties, <span class="italic">or a mistake of one party, which the other at the time knew or suspected,</span> a written contract does not truly express the intention of the parties, it may be revised on the application of a party aggrieved, so as to express that intention, so far as it can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons, in good faith and for value.” (Italics added.)</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly there was a mistake, Joan and her attorney thinking that a $550,000 value resulted in a community equity of about $70,000. The mistake was known to Tim’s former attorney who swept it under the rug in the counter-offer by setting forth just the equity, instead of the value minus encumbrances, as he did with respect to other properties. True, he apparently justified this to himself morally by the fact that the value which Tim had been claiming all along resulted in a $70,000 equity, but he never drew the other side’s attention to the fact that the counter-offer was based on Tim’s previous position on the value of the Holt property. Joan and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page442" class="pagebreak">442</span>her attorney were, of course, quite satisfied in believing that Tim had surrendered his point on Holt since she was to abandon her position with respect to the ownership of 13,000 shares and the method of valuing of the entire block of 20,500 shares. Inasmuch as the error was discovered by Tim’s attorney, it is, of course, no defense that it was negligently made by Joan’s attorney. Nor was the defense based on any such theory. Rather what the defense proceeded to do was to isolate the problem of the correct valuation of the Holt property from all others that were on the table during the final settlement negotiations, by offering proof that it was worth no more than an amount which would result in the $70,000 equity. The trial court clearly went along with this approach, permitted Tim to prove the value of the Holt property by expert testimony and other means, found that the property was worth no more than $425,000, that Joan had received an equitable division of the community property “and that no reformation is required for said reason.”</p>
<p class="indent">Joan’s counsel at all times resisted this compartmentalization of the issues that divided the parties before the property settlement agreement was signed. He was, of course, quite correct. If it is the law that reformation in this case can only be had if the trial court felt that the division of community property was fair, how could it possibly make such a finding based only on the value of the Holt property? As noted, Joan’s extremely tenable position with respect to the stock would, if sustained, have been worth about $40,000, while the fight over the Holt property meant only $25,000. How did the trial court take into account the fact that Joan waived alimony? What the court did, in effect, was to retry just one of the many issues that could have arisen in a litigated divorce, to find that she would not have prevailed on that issue and to conclude from that that the entire property settlement agreement was fair.</p>
<p class="indent">This approach was wholly wrong. It ignores that the parties had settled their claims, thereby giving up any right to have a court determine them. That goes for Tim, as well as for Joan. The only legitimate question which was before the trial court was whether the settlement agreement should be reformed to express Joan’s intent which was known to Tim who also knew, through his attorney, that the instrument did not express it.</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel for Tim argues, as defendants in these cases usually do, that Tim never intended to enter into a settlement based on the $550,000 figure and that a court of equity cannot make a new contract for the parties, whether a mistake is unilateral or bilateral. The law is, however, more subtle in that it estops the party who knows of the plaintiff’s mistake from claiming that his intent differs from what he leads the other to believe it is. In <span class="italic">Eagle Indem. Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com.</span>, 92 Cal.App.2d 222, an insurer knew that a certain policy did not provide for certain coverage, and that the insured thought it did. It was held that the policy was subject to reformation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page443" class="pagebreak">443</span>according to the insured’s intent. “Petitioner argues that the commission by ordering reformation of the policy created a new contract for the parties. Of course, reformation cannot be ordered so as to create a new and different contract for the parties but where, as here, the case falls within the language of Civil Code, section 3399, ‘[w]hen, through * * * a mistake of one party, which the other * * * knew or suspected, a written contract does not truly express the intention of the parties * * *’ <span class="italic">the contract which was intended by the party acting under unilateral mistake known or suspected by the other, is, as a matter of law, the contract of the parties.</span> * * *” Indeed, in view of the express wording of section 3399 of the Civil Code any other rule would thwart the legislative intent.</p>
<p class="indent">The rule that the party who misleads another is estopped from claiming that the contract is anything but what the other is led to believe, appears to be quite generally accepted. Citing many cases from other jurisdictions and noting no contrary authority Corbin says: “Reformation may be a proper remedy even though the mistake is not mutual. If one of the parties mistakenly believes that the writing is a correct integration of that to which he had expressed his assent and the other party knows that it is not, reformation may be decreed. The conduct of the other party in permitting the first to execute the erroneous writing and later attempting to enforce it may be regarded as fraudulent; but it is enough to justify reformation that he knows the terms proposed by the first party and the meaning thereof and leads that party reasonably to believe that he too assents to those terms. This makes a contract; and the writing may be reformed to accord with it. The fact that the first party was negligent in failing to observe that the writing does not express what he has assented to does not deprive him of this remedy. The ground for estoppel is against the other and non-mistaken party, not against the mistaken party even though he is negligent.” (3 Corbin on Contracts, § 614) The rule is also in accord with the Restatement of Contracts.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_85" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-85" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Therefore the fact stressed over and over again by defendant, that he never affirmatively assented to a $550,000 valuation, is quite immaterial.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court made a number of detailed findings, some of which are quite evidentiary and argumentative, which are attacked as being without support in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page444" class="pagebreak">444</span>evidence. There is no need to discuss all of them, since several only relate to the basic misconception that Tim’s lack of affirmative assent to the higher value vitiates Joan’s right to reformation. We only discuss those which, if founded on evidence, might support the judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">The court found four different times that plaintiff knew that the counter-offer was not based on the $550,000 value. There just is nothing in the record to support that finding. Even if we attach no sinister significance to the fact that the counter-offer did not set forth the value on which the $70,000 equity depended and on the fact that no value was mentioned during the negotiations of February 16, 1968, we are still left with a plaintiff who mistakenly believed that her valuation had been accepted and a defendant who knew of that belief.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_86" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-86" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The court found that Joan would have entered into the property settlement agreement if she had not obtained the acceptance of the $550,000 valuation. This, of course, is a far cry from finding that she would have settled if she had known that the settlement was based on $450,000. In any event there is nothing whatever in the record to support the finding. Tim argues that the finding is justified by Joan’s knowledge he would not accept her $550,000 figure. As we have shown that finding is not supported in the evidence. The finding is thus based solely on conjecture. Settlement negotiations of the kind that were had between the parties are usually nothing but a high stake game of poker. Since it appears that each was holding the cards close to the vest, it does not appear possible to determine judicially who was bluffing. Finally we have found no case which indicates that it matters what Joan would have done had Tim been more frank. By permitting her to enter into the contract in the belief that he had accepted her $550,000 value, he simply took the risk that if she discovered the mistake and sought judicial redress, the contract would be enforced on the terms which she mistakenly thought she had already received.</p>
<p class="indent">The court found that Tim did not conceal any item of community property and that he disclosed the “nature, description and value” of all the items. What Tim concealed, however, was his discovery of the error or errors, which concealment, or to put it more charitably, which lack of disclosure is the nub of this litigation.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page445" class="pagebreak">445</div>
<p class="indent">The case was fully tried and, as we said at the outset of our discussion, the record supports nothing but a judgment for the plaintiff as prayed.</p>
<p id="sec195" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Note that in this case Ms. Tate is granted reformation of the contract, which is then enforced against Mr. Tate. This result is justified because Mr. Tate and his lawyer knew of her error. Suppose the lawyer and Mr. Tate had not been aware of the mistake. What remedies, if any, would Ms. Tate be entitled to: relief from enforcement of the contract, rescission, reformation?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What should Mr. Tate’s lawyer have done when he became aware of the mistake? Suppose the lawyer advised Mr. Tate of the mistake and counseled him not to take unfair advantage of his poor ex-wife, but Mr. Tate just laughed. Would his attorney be free under the Rules of Professional Conduct to say anything to Ms. Tate or her lawyer? What could he do? Consider the following ethics opinion:</p>
<p id="sec196" class="noindent">ABA S<small>TANDING</small> C<small>OMMITTEE ON</small> E<small>THICS AND</small> P<small>ROFESSIONAL</small> R<small>ESPONSIBILITY</small>, I<small>NFORMAL</small> O<small>PINION</small> 86–1518 (F<small>EB</small>. 9, 1986)</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A and B, with the assistance of their lawyers, have negotiated a commercial contract. After deliberation with counsel, A ultimately acquiesced in the final provision insisted upon by B, previously in dispute between the parties and without which B would have refused to come to overall agreement. However, A’s lawyer discovered that the final draft of the contract typed in the office of B’s lawyer did not contain the provision which had been in dispute. The Committee has been asked to give its opinion as to the ethical duty of A’s lawyer in that circumstance.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The Committee considers this situation to involve merely a scrivener’s error, not an intentional change in position by the other party. A meeting of the minds has already occurred. The Committee concludes that the error is appropriate for correction between the lawyers without client consultation.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_87" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-87" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A’s lawyer does not have a duty to advise A of the error pursuant to any obligation of communication under Rule 1.4 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (1983). “The guiding principle is that the lawyer should fulfill reasonable client expectations for information consistent with the duty to act in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page446" class="pagebreak">446</span>the client’s best interests and the client’s overall requirements as to the character of representation.” Comment to Rule 1.4. In this circumstance there is no “informed decision,” in the language of Rule 1.4, that A needs to make; the decision on the contract has already been made by the client. Furthermore, the Comment to Rule 1.2 points out that the lawyer may decide the “technical” means to be employed to carry out the objective of the representation, without consultation with the client.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The client does not have a right to take unfair advantage of the error. The client’s right pursuant to Rule 1.2 to expect committed and dedicated representation is not unlimited. Indeed, for A’s lawyer to suggest that A has an opportunity to capitalize on the clerical error, unrecognized by B and B’s lawyer, might raise a serious question of the violation of the duty of A’s lawyer under Rule 1.2(d) not to counsel the client to engage in, or assist the client in, conduct the lawyer knows is fraudulent. In addition, Rule 4.1(b) admonishes the lawyer not knowingly to fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a fraudulent act by a client, and Rule 8.4(c) prohibits the lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The result would be the same under the predecessor ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility (1969, revised 1980). While EC 7–8 teaches that a lawyer should use best efforts to ensure that the client’s decisions are made after the client has been informed of relevant considerations, and EC 9–2 charges the lawyer with fully and promptly informing the client of material developments, the scrivener’s error is neither a relevant consideration nor a material development and therefore does not establish an opportunity for a client’s decision. The duty of zealous representation in DR 7–101 is limited to lawful objectives. See DR 7–102. Rule 1.2 evolved from DR 7–102(A)(7), which prohibits a lawyer from counseling or assisting the client in conduct known to be fraudulent. See also DR 1–102(A)(4), the precursor of Rule 8.4(c), prohibiting the lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The standards governing the ethical dilemmas faced by Mr. Tate’s lawyer will not be affected by the new Rules of Professional Conduct currently under consideration in California.f</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Suppose no lawyers were involved. Would Mr. Tate or his non-lawyer advisor be able to take advantage of the other side’s apparent miscalculation?</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">4</span>. If you see an item in a store bearing a price tag that appears very low, are you free to buy the goods? Must you point out the low price and ask the storeowner whether he means it? If you don’t ask, can the storeowner recover the goods later on a claim of mistake? Better yet, can the storeowner later prove that you had reason to know <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page447" class="pagebreak">447</span>there was a mistake and therefore reform the contract and make you pay the higher price for the goods?</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">(3) <span class="italic">Mistake in Performance.</span> A third kind of mistake is likely not to involve a contract at all. Sometimes one party in his performance exceeds the agreement. The question then arises whether he is entitled to compensation for the services he has rendered in the mistaken belief that they were required under a contract. The attendant at the filling station who thought you said, “fill it up,” and did so when you only asked for $10 worth, may not have a contract with you because of the misunderstanding, but she wants to be paid for the tankful of gasoline. So does the paver who was supposed to put a new driveway in front of your neighbor’s house but repaves your broken old driveway instead. These are traditional cases for relief, but not under a contract theory. Equitable, restitutionary, and “quasi-contract” principles are available to provide compensation and prevent unjust enrichment in at least the more outrageous of these cases.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) <span class="italic">Misunderstandings.</span> In some cases the error occurs somewhere in the communications between the parties. The language reasonably used by one party to refer to something is reasonably understood by the other party as referring to something else; the parties are simply not talking about the same thing. In fact, no agreement is reached in these cases, and the likely conclusion is that there is no contract because none was ever made.</p>

<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page449" class="pagebreak">449</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Milward, in support of the demurrer</span>.—The contract was for the sale of a number of bales of cotton of a particular description, which the plaintiff was ready to deliver. It is immaterial by what ship the cotton was to arrive, so that it was a ship called the “Peerless.” The words “to arrive ex ‘Peerless,’” only mean that if the vessel is lost on the voyage, the contract is to be at an end. [P<small>OLLOCK</small>, C.B.—It would be a question for the jury whether both parties meant the same ship called the “Peerless.”] That would be so if the contract was for the sale of a ship called the “Peerless;” but it is for the sale of cotton on board a ship of that name. [P<small>OLLOCK</small>, C.B.—The defendant only bought that cotton which was to arrive by a particular ship. It may as well be said, that if there is a contract for the purchase of certain goods in warehouse A., that is satisfied by the delivery of goods of the same description in warehouse B.] In that case there would be goods in both warehouses; here it does not appear that the plaintiff had any goods on board the other “Peerless.” [M<small>ARTIN</small>, B.—It is imposing on the defendant a contract different from that which he entered into. P<small>OLLOCK</small>, C.B.—It is like a contract for the purchase of wine coming from a particular estate in France or Spain, where there are two estates of that name.] The defendant has no right to contradict by parol evidence a written contract good upon the face of it. He does not impute misrepresentation or fraud, but only says that he fancied the ship was a different one. Intention is of no avail, unless stated at the time of the contract. [P<small>OLLOCK</small>, C.B.—One vessel sailed in October and the other in December.] The time of sailing is no part of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Mellish (Cohen with him), in support of the plea</span>.—There is nothing on the face of the contract to show that any particular ship called the “Peerless” was meant; but the moment it appears that two ships called the “Peerless” were about to sail from Bombay there is a latent ambiguity, and parol evidence may be given for the purpose of showing that the defendant meant one “Peerless” and the plaintiff another. That being so, there was no consensus ad idem, and therefore no binding contract. He was then stopped by the Court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">P<small>ER</small> C<small>URIAM</small></span>. There must be judgment for the defendants.</p>
<p id="sec199" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Most of this report consists of the argument among counsel (Milward, Mellish, and Cohen) and the judges (Chief Baron Pollock and Baron Martin). What was the court’s opinion in this case?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If there were not two ships named <span class="italic">Peerless</span> involved in this case, but the goods merely arrived two months late, would the court find that the buyer had to accept the goods anyway? Would the court be likely to find no binding contract?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page450" class="pagebreak">450</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The significance of there being two ships named <span class="italic">Peerless</span> may relate to the scheduled arrival dates of the ships and the buyer’s position as a cotton merchant who resells the cotton in anticipation of its arrival. If there were two ships named <span class="italic">Peerless</span> and they arrived at Liverpool fifteen minutes apart, would it make any difference if seller meant one ship and buyer was thinking of the other? Suppose buyer was a consumer of raw cotton who maintained a warehouse full of inventory for his manufacturing operation so that, whether this shipment arrived in October or December, it could be expected to sit in the inventory for many months before being used. Wouldn’t there be just as much of a misunderstanding in either of these circumstances? Would the contract be enforced?</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">(5) <span class="italic">Mistake in Basic Assumptions.</span> The preceding kinds of mistake are relatively noncontroversial. The law’s major problem with contract mistake arises in those situations where an agreement apparently is reached, and the language is correctly recorded, but the parties were mistaken in the sense that some of the relevant assumptions upon which the deal was based were incorrect.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine the situation in which A sells B a pebble which they both believe to be a diamond; or A sells B a diamond which they both believe to be a pretty pebble. At least on the surface there is no misunderstanding in this case because both parties are referring to the same rock. The mistake is in their assumption, which may be tacit or explicit, as to the nature of the rock, diamond, or pretty pebble. If the mistake is entertained by only one of the parties, as when one believes the stone to be a diamond and the other knows that it is a pebble, the situation begins to look like a misunderstanding at best, and like fraud at worst. The line here between legitimate, shrewd business dealing and fraud by nondisclosure is a fine one. Recall also the fine line between legitimate sales enthusiasm and fraudulent misrepresentation we have just considered in the preceding subsection and notice the overtones of mistake it contains.</p>

<p class="sectionb">New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, 1979.</p>
<p class="sectionb">166 N.J.Super. 442, 400 A.2d 78.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ C<small>ONFORD</small>, P. J. A. D. Plaintiff, a retail dealer in coins, brought an action for rescission of a purchase by it from defendant for $500 of a dime purportedly minted in 1916 at Denver. Defendant is a part-time coin dealer. Plaintiff asserts a mutual mistake of fact as to the genuineness of the coin as Denver-minted, such a coin being a rarity and therefore having a market value greatly in excess of its normal monetary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page451" class="pagebreak">451</span>worth. Plaintiff’s evidence at trial that the “D” on the coin signifying Denver mintage was counterfeited is not disputed by defendant. Although at trial defendant disputed that the coin tendered back to him by plaintiff was the one he sold, the implicit trial finding is to the contrary, and that issue is not raised on appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial judge, sitting without a jury, held for defendant on the ground that the customary “coin dealing procedures” were for a dealer purchasing a coin to make his own investigation of the genuineness of the coin and to “assume the risk” of his purchase if his investigation is faulty. The judge conceded that the evidence demonstrated satisfaction of the ordinary requisites of the rule of rescission for mutual mistake of fact that both parties act under a mistake of fact and that the fact be “central” (material) to the making of the contract. The proofs were that the seller had himself acquired this coin and two others of minor value for a total of $450 and that his representative had told the purchaser that he would not sell the dime for less than $500. The principal of plaintiff firm spent from 15 to 45 minutes in close examination of the coin before purchasing it. Soon thereafter he received an offer of $700 for the coin subject to certification of its genuineness by the American Numismatic Society. That organization labeled it a counterfeit, and as a result plaintiff instituted the present action.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence and trial judge’s findings establish this as a classic case of rescission for mutual mistake of fact. As a general rule,</p>
<p class="blockquote">* * * where parties on entering into a transaction that affects their contractual relations are both under a mistake regarding a fact assumed by them as the basis on which they entered into the transaction, it is voidable by either party if enforcement of it would be materially more onerous to him than it would have been had the fact been as the parties believed it to be.</p>

<p class="noindent">By way of example, the Restatement posits the following: “A contracts to sell to B a specific bar of silver before them. The parties supposed that the bar is sterling. It has, however, a much larger admixture of base metal. The contract is voidable by B.”</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, “negligent failure of a party to know or to discover the facts as to which both parties are under a mistake does not preclude rescission or reformation on account thereof.” Restatement, [Contracts] § 502. The law of New Jersey is in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page452" class="pagebreak">452</span>accord. <span class="italic">See Riviere v. Berla</span> (1918). In the <span class="italic">Riviere</span> case relief was denied only because the parties could not be restored to the status quo ante. In the present case they can be. It is undisputed that both parties believed that the coin was a genuine Denver-minted one. The mistake was mutual in that both parties were laboring under the same misapprehension as to this particular, essential fact. The price asked and paid was directly based on that assumption. That plaintiff may have been negligent in his inspection of the coin (a point not expressly found but implied by the trial judge) does not, as noted above, bar its claim for rescission.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s contention that plaintiff assumed the risk that the coin might be of greater or lesser value than that paid is not supported by the evidence. It is well established that a party to a contract can assume the risk of being mistaken as to the value of the thing sold. The Restatement states the rule this way:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Where the parties know that there is doubt in regard to a certain matter and contract on that assumption, the contract is not rendered voidable because one is disappointed in the hope that the facts accord with his wishes. The risk of the existence of the doubtful fact is then assumed as one of the elements of the bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Restatement, Contracts § 502, Comment <span class="italic">f</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">However, for the stated rule to apply, the parties must be conscious that the pertinent fact may not be true and make their agreement at the risk of that possibility. In this case both parties were certain that the coin was genuine. They so testified. Plaintiff’s principal thought so after his inspection, and defendant would not have paid nearly $450 for it otherwise. A different case would be presented if the seller were uncertain either of the genuineness of the coin or of its value if genuine, and had accepted the expert buyer’s judgment on these matters.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial judge’s rationale of custom of the trade is not supported by the evidence. It depended upon the testimony of plaintiff’s expert witness who on cross-examination as to the “procedure” on the purchase by a dealer of a rare coin, stated that the dealer would check it with magnification and then “normally send it to the American Numismatic Certification Service for certification.” This testimony does not in our opinion establish that practice as a usage of trade “having such regularity of observance in a * * * trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question,” within the intent of the Uniform Commercial Code [§ 1–205(2)].<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_89" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-89" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The cited code provision contemplates that the trade usage is so prevalent as to warrant the conclusion that the parties contracted with reference to, and intended <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page453" class="pagebreak">453</span>their agreement to be governed by it. Our reading of the testimony does not indicate any basis for findings either that this was a trade usage within the Code definition at all or that these parties in fact accepted it as such to the extent that they were agreeing that because of it the sale was an “as is” transaction. Indeed, the same witness testified there was a “normal policy” among coin dealers throughout the United States of a “return privilege” for altered coins.</p>
<p class="indent">The foregoing conclusions make it unnecessary for us to discuss plaintiff’s alternative contention that the contract was “unenforceable” because it constituted an illegal contract to purchase a counterfeit coin. We regard that position as devoid of merit.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversed.</p>
<p id="sec201" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>

<p id="sec202" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Lenawee County Board of Health v. Messerly</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Michigan Supreme Court, 1982.</p>
<p class="sectionb">417 Mich. 17, 331 N.W.2d 203.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ R<small>YAN</small>, J. In March of 1977, Carl and Nancy Pickles, appellees, purchased from appellants, William and Martha Messerly, a 600–square–foot tract of land upon which is located a three-unit apartment building. Shortly after the transaction was closed, the Lenawee County Board of Health condemned the property and obtained a permanent injunction which prohibits human habitation on the premises until the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page454" class="pagebreak">454</span>defective sewage system is brought into conformance with the Lenawee County sanitation code.</p>
<p class="indent">We are required to determine whether appellees should prevail in their attempt to avoid this land contract on the basis of mutual mistake and failure of consideration. We conclude that the parties did entertain a mutual misapprehension of fact, but that the circumstances of this case do not warrant rescission.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The trial court found that, prior to this transfer, the Messerlys’ predecessor in title, Mr. Bloom, had installed a septic tank on the property without a permit and in violation of the applicable health code….</p>
<p class="indent">… After inspecting the property, Mr. and Mrs. Pickles executed a new land contract with the Messerlys on March 21, 1977. It provided for a purchase price of $25,500. A clause was added to the end of the land contract form which provides:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">“17. Purchaser has examined this property and agrees to accept same in its present condition. There are no other or additional written or oral understandings.”</p>
<p class="indent">Five or six days later, when the Pickleses went to introduce themselves to the tenants, they discovered raw sewage seeping out of the ground. Tests conducted by a sanitation expert indicated the inadequacy of the sewage system. The Lenawee County Board of Health subsequently condemned the property and initiated this lawsuit in the Lenawee Circuit Court against the Messerlys as land contract vendors, and the Pickleses, as vendees, to obtain a permanent injunction proscribing human habitation of the premises until the property was brought into conformance with the Lenawee County sanitation code. The injunction was granted, and the Lenawee County Board of Health was permitted to withdraw from the lawsuit by stipulation of the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">After a bench trial, the court concluded that the Pickleses had no cause of action against either the Messerlys or the Barneses as there was no fraud or misrepresentation. This ruling was predicated on the trial judge’s conclusion that none of the parties knew of Mr. Bloom’s earlier transgression or of the resultant problem with the septic system until it was discovered by the Pickleses, and that the sanitation problem was not caused by any of the parties. The trial court held that the property was purchased “as is,” after inspection and, accordingly, its “negative * * * value cannot be blamed upon an innocent seller.” Foreclosure was ordered against the Pickleses, together with a judgment against them in the amount of $25,943.09.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. and Mrs. Pickles appealed from the adverse judgment. The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the trial court’s ruling with respect to Mr. and Mrs. Barnes but, in a two-to-one decision, reversed the finding of no cause of action on the Pickleses’ claims against the Messerlys. It concluded that the mutual mistake between the Messerlys and the Pickleses went to a basic, as opposed to a collateral, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page455" class="pagebreak">455</span>element of the contract, and that the parties intended to transfer income-producing rental property but, in actuality, the vendees paid $25,500 for an asset without value.</p>
<p class="indent">We granted the Messerlys’ application for leave to appeal.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">We must decide initially whether there was a mistaken belief entertained by one or both parties to the contract in dispute and, if so, the resultant legal significance.</p>
<p class="indent">A contractual mistake “is a belief that is not in accord with the facts.” 1 Restatement Contracts, 2d, § 151. The erroneous belief of one or both of the parties must relate to a fact in existence at the time the contract is executed. That is to say, the belief which is found to be in error may not be, in substance, a prediction as to a future occurrence or non-occurrence.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals concluded, after a <span class="italic">de novo</span> review of the record, that the parties were mistaken as to the income-producing capacity of the property in question. We agree. The vendors and the vendees each believed that the property transferred could be utilized as income-generating rental property. All of the parties subsequently learned that, in fact, the property was unsuitable for any residential use.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants assert that there was no mistake in the contractual sense because the defect in the sewage system did not arise until after the contract was executed. The appellees respond that the Messerlys are confusing the date of the inception of the defect with the date upon which the defect was discovered.</p>
<p class="indent">This is essentially a factual dispute which the trial court failed to resolve directly. Nevertheless, we are empowered to draw factual inferences from the facts found by the trial court.</p>
<p class="indent">An examination of the record reveals that the septic system was defective prior to the date on which the land contract was executed. The Messerlys’ grantor installed a nonconforming septic system without a permit prior to the transfer of the property to the Messerlys in 1971. Moreover, virtually undisputed testimony indicates that, assuming ideal soil conditions, 2,500 square feet of property is necessary to support a sewage system adequate to serve a three-family dwelling. Likewise, 750 square feet is mandated for a one-family home. Thus, the division of the parcel and sale of one acre of the property by Mr. and Mrs. Barnes in 1976 made it impossible to remedy the already illegal septic system within the confines of the 600–square–foot parcel.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants do not dispute these underlying facts which give rise to an inference contrary to their contentions.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page456" class="pagebreak">456</div>
<p class="indent">Having determined that when these parties entered into the land contract they were laboring under a mutual mistake of fact, we now direct our attention to a determination of the legal significance of that finding.</p>
<p class="indent">A contract may be rescinded because of a mutual misapprehension of the parties, but this remedy is granted only in the sound discretion of the court. Appellants argue that the parties’ mistake relates only to the quality or value of the real estate transferred, and that such mistakes are collateral to the agreement and do not justify rescission, citing <span class="italic">A &amp; M Land Development Co. v. Miller</span>, 354 Mich. 681 (1959).</p>
<p class="indent">In that case, the plaintiff was the purchaser of 91 lots of real property. It sought partial rescission of the land contract when it was frustrated in its attempts to develop 42 of the lots because it could not obtain permits from the county health department to install septic tanks on these lots. This Court refused to allow rescission because the mistake, whether mutual or unilateral, related only to the value of the property.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">There was here no mistake as to the form or substance of the contract between the parties, or the description of the property constituting the subject matter. The situation involved is not at all analogous to that presented in <span class="italic">Scott v. Grow</span>, 301 Mich. 226 (1942). There the plaintiff sought relief by way of reformation of a deed on the ground that the instrument of conveyance had not been drawn in accordance with the intention and agreement of the parties. It was held that the bill of complaint stated a case for the granting of equitable relief by way of reformation. In the case at bar plaintiff received the property for which it contracted. The fact that it may be of less value than the purchaser expected at the time of the transaction is not a sufficient basis for the granting of equitable relief, neither fraud nor reliance on misrepresentation of material facts having been established.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees contend, on the other hand, that in this case the parties were mistaken as to the very nature of the character of the consideration and claim that the pervasive and essential quality of this mistake renders rescission appropriate. They cite in support of that view <span class="italic">Sherwood v. Walker</span>, 66 Mich. 568 (1887), the famous “barren cow” case. In that case, the parties agreed to the sale and purchase of a cow which was thought to be barren, but which was, in reality, with calf. When the seller discovered the fertile condition of his cow, he refused to deliver her. In permitting rescission, the Court stated:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It seems to me, however, in the case made by this record, that the mistake or misapprehension of the parties went to the whole substance of the agreement. If the cow was a breeder, she was worth at least $750; if barren, she was worth not over $80. The parties would not have made the contract of sale except upon the understanding and belief that she was incapable of breeding, and of no use as a cow. It is true she is now the identical animal that they thought her to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page457" class="pagebreak">457</span>when the contract was made; there is no mistake as to the identity of the creature. Yet the mistake was not of the mere quality of the animal, but went to the very nature of the thing. A barren cow is substantially a different creature than a breeding one. There is as much difference between them for all purposes of use as there is between an ox and a cow that is capable of breeding and giving milk. If the mutual mistake had simply related to the fact whether she was with calf or not for one season, then it might have been a good sale; but the mistake affected the character of the animal for all time, and for her present and ultimate use. She was not in fact the animal, or the kind of animal, the defendants intended to sell or the plaintiff to buy. She was not a barren cow, and, if this fact had been known, there would have been no contract. The mistake affected the substance of the whole consideration, and it must be considered that there was no contract to sell or sale of the cow as she actually was. The thing sold and bought had in fact no existence. She was sold as a beef creature would be sold; she is in fact a breeding cow, and a valuable one.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The court should have instructed the jury that if they found that the cow was sold, or contracted to be sold, upon the understanding of both parties that she was barren, and useless for the purpose of breeding, and that in fact she was not barren, but capable of breeding, then the defendants had a right to rescind, and to refuse to deliver, and the verdict should be in their favor.</p>
<p class="indent">As the parties suggest, the foregoing precedent arguably distinguishes mistakes affecting the essence of the consideration from those which go to its quality or value, affording relief on a per se basis for the former but not the latter.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the distinctions which may be drawn from <span class="italic">Sherwood</span> and <span class="italic">A &amp; M Land Development Co.</span> do not provide a satisfactory analysis of the nature of a mistake sufficient to invalidate a contract. Often, a mistake relates to an underlying factual assumption which, when discovered, directly affects value, but simultaneously and materially affects the essence of the contractual consideration. It is disingenuous to label such a mistake collateral.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant and appellee both mistakenly believed that the property which was the subject of their land contract would generate income as rental property. The fact that it could not be used for human habitation deprived the property of its income-earning potential and rendered it less valuable. However, this mistake, while directly and dramatically affecting the property’s value, cannot accurately be characterized as collateral because it also affects the very essence of the consideration. “The thing sold and bought [income generating rental property] had in fact no existence.”</p>
<p class="indent">We find that the inexact and confusing distinction between contractual mistakes running to value and those touching the substance of the consideration serves only as an impediment to a clear and helpful analysis for the equitable resolution of cases <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page458" class="pagebreak">458</span>in which mistake is alleged and proven. Accordingly, the holdings of <span class="italic">A &amp; M Land Development Co.</span> and <span class="italic">Sherwood</span> with respect to the material or collateral nature of a mistake are limited to the facts of those cases.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, we think the better-reasoned approach is a case-by-case analysis whereby rescission is indicated when the mistaken belief relates to a basic assumption of the parties upon which the contract is made, and which materially affects the agreed performances of the parties.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_90" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-90" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></sup> Rescission is not available, however, to relieve a party who has assumed the risk of loss in connection with the mistake.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_91" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-91" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">All of the parties to this contract erroneously assumed that the property transferred by the vendors to the vendees was suitable for human habitation and could be utilized to generate rental income. The fundamental nature of these assumptions is indicated by the fact that their invalidity changed the character of the property transferred, thereby frustrating, indeed precluding, Mr. and Mrs. Pickles’ intended use of the real estate. Although the Pickleses are disadvantaged by enforcement of the contract, performance is advantageous to the Messerlys, as the property at issue is less valuable absent its income-earning potential. Nothing short of rescission can remedy the mistake. Thus, the parties’ mistake as to a basic assumption materially affects the agreed performances of the parties.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page459" class="pagebreak">459</div>
<p class="indent">Despite the significance of the mistake made by the parties, we reverse the Court of Appeals because we conclude that equity does not justify the remedy sought by Mr. and Mrs. Pickles.</p>
<p class="indent">Rescission is an equitable remedy which is granted only in the sound discretion of the court. A court need not grant rescission in every case in which the mutual mistake relates to a basic assumption and materially affects the agreed performance of the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">In cases of mistake by two equally innocent parties, we are required, in the exercise of our equitable powers, to determine which blameless party should assume the loss resulting from the misapprehension they shared. Normally that can only be done by drawing upon our “own notions of what is reasonable and just under all the surrounding circumstances.”</p>
<p class="indent">Equity suggests that, in this case, the risk should be allocated to the purchasers. We are guided to that conclusion, in part, by the standards announced in § 154 of the Restatement of Contracts 2d, for determining when a party bears the risk of mistake. See fn. 12. Section 154(a) suggests that the court should look first to whether the parties have agreed to the allocation of the risk between themselves. While there is no express assumption in the contract by either party of the risk of the property becoming uninhabitable, there was indeed some agreed allocation of the risk to the vendees by the incorporation of an “as is” clause into the contract which, we repeat, provided:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“Purchaser has examined this property and agrees to accept same in its present condition. There are no other or additional written or oral understandings.”</p>
<p class="indent">That is a persuasive indication that the parties considered that, as between them, such risk as related to the “present condition” of the property should lie with the purchaser. If the “as is” clause is to have any meaning at all, it must be interpreted to refer to those defects which were unknown at the time that the contract was executed. Thus, the parties themselves assigned the risk of loss to Mr. and Mrs. Pickles.</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that Mr. and Mrs. Pickles are not entitled to the equitable remedy of rescission and, accordingly, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p id="sec203" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What was the mistake that the Pickleses assert justifies rescission and avoidance of the contract? Was this a unilateral or a mutual mistake, or either or neither? Frame a description of the circumstances in this case that will fit each of these categories.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page460" class="pagebreak">460</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. On what basis does the court conclude that the burden of this mistake was allocated to the Pickleses? What is the significance of the “as is” clause, the concept of <span class="italic">caveat emptor,</span> the existence of an opportunity to inspect? Weren’t the Messerlys under a comparable obligation to be aware of the status of their cesspool, whether their property was habitable under health regulations, and whether the property they were selling in fact could be rented without violating the law? If they were under an obligation to know about the state of the sanitary facilities in the apartment house they rented to others, why weren’t they under an obligation to disclose this information to potential buyers like the Pickleses?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Why does the court in this case place the burden of mutual mistake on the buyer, while in <span class="italic">Beachcomber Coins</span> the burden is placed on the seller? Is there any way to reconcile these cases?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Consider the following factors that may be of help in deciding when to relieve a party from liability for a promise grounded on mistaken assumptions:</p>
<p class="blockquote">a. Was the mistake the fault of the mistaken party?</p>
<p class="blockquote">b. Is there a basis other than fault for allocating the risk to one side or the other? Are there grounds for saying one side either bought or was paid to assume this risk, that one side is in a better position to prevent it, to bear it, to distribute it?</p>
<p class="blockquote">c. Are there reasons to say that one side took advantage of the other? Was the relying party operating in good faith? Are there shades of fraud and unconscionability?</p>
<p class="blockquote">d. Can the contract be “rescinded” and the parties restored to the <span class="italic">status quo ante?</span></p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Another type of mistake in assumptions involves erroneous assumptions as to future events. Mistakes of this kind also sometimes affect enforceability of an otherwise valid contract. This subject is covered in conjunction with Supervening Events, p. 757.</p>

<p class="indent">The allocation of the risks of mistakes in assumptions is likely to arise in particularly dramatic form in situations where an injured party settles a claim and gives the liable party a release or when a party about to engage in a risky activity gives a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page461" class="pagebreak">461</span>release of potential liability to induce another to allow the activity to take place. In both situations there are strong reasons to allow the release to operate to allocate the risks or to settle the liability finally. In both situations, however, subsequent information may disclose that the parties were fundamentally mistaken when they agreed to the release. Two powerful interests (now) collide, and the result may be difficult to predict.</p>

<p class="sectionb">California Court of Appeal, 1996</p>
<p class="sectionb">48 Cal.App.4th 608, 55 Cal.Rptr.2d 818</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>UGLIA</small>, P<small>RESIDING</small> J<small>USTICE</small>. This appeal concerns the legality of a release from liability required as a condition for purchasing, renting, or obtaining service on ski bindings. For reasons hereafter discussed, we shall conclude the use of such releases in the ski industry does not violate either state unfair competition laws or the Consumers Legal Remedies Act.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff, Philip A. Olsen, is an attorney and “avid recreational skier” who for many years has represented in personal injury litigation plaintiffs who sustained injuries skiing. In December 1993, plaintiff took his skis to a shop operated by defendant Breeze, Inc. (Breeze) to be serviced, including the adjustment of his ski bindings. As a condition for the return of his equipment, plaintiff was required to sign a form which described the risks of skiing and released Breeze from any liability <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page462" class="pagebreak">462</span>for injury resulting from use of the equipment, including injury caused by negligence, breach of warranty, or product defect.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_92" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> He refused to sign the form and was denied return of his equipment.</p>
<p class="indent">The requirement of a release by Breeze is consistent with industry custom. Ski equipment distributors throughout the state offer indemnity to retail and service outlets in the event of injury caused by the failure of ski bindings to release properly but only if the retailer or service provider has obtained the customer’s signature on a release form supplied by the distributor, or one substantially similar thereto. This form is a release of liability, similar to that used by Breeze, often absolving both the retailer/service provider and the distributor from legal liability for injuries caused by failure of the equipment.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff initiated this action on behalf of himself and all others in the State who own or seek to rent or purchase ski bindings of various brands. Named as defendants are six ski equipment distributors, Salomon/North America, Inc. (Salomon), Head Sports, Inc. (Head), Raichle–Molitor, USA, Inc. (Raichle), Geze Sports Products (Geze), Marker USA, Inc. (Marker), and Atomic Ski USA, Inc. (Atomic), who are alleged to supply “all, or substantially all,” the ski bindings sold and rented in the state of California. Also named as defendants are Trimont Land Company (Trimont), the operator of two ski areas in Northern California, Breeze, a retailer/service provider and a class of all others situated similarly to either Trimont or Breeze. The trial court denied plaintiff’s motion to certify a defendant class as alleged. Plaintiff does not challenge this ruling on appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">The complaint contains two causes of action. The first cause of action alleges violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The second cause of action alleges unfair competition. Plaintiff alleges it is unlawful and unconscionable for defendants to require customers to sign releases of liability as a condition for obtaining goods or services. The CLRA cause of action is stated on behalf of a plaintiff class, while the unfair competition claim is stated on behalf of plaintiff alone. In addition to the two separately stated causes of action, the complaint contains two counts seeking, respectively, declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on the modified releases, the various defendants moved for summary adjudication of the unfair competition cause of action and for a determination the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page463" class="pagebreak">463</span>CLRA claim is without merit. The superior court granted these motions as to all defendants except Head and Raichle and entered judgments of dismissal. Plaintiff appeals from these judgments.</p>
<p class="indent">The matter proceeded to trial before the court without a jury as to Head and Raichle. The court granted the motion of these defendants to vary the order of proof, permitting the issues whether Head adequately modified its release and whether Raichle is no longer in a position to modify its release to conform to California law to be tried first. Head presented evidence that it changed its release form and communicated this change to its retail outlets. Raichle presented evidence that it is no longer authorized to distribute ski bindings in California. Head and Raichle moved for judgment. The superior court granted the motions and entered judgments of dismissal. Plaintiff also appeals from these judgments.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">We address first plaintiff’s unfair competition cause of action. Business and Professions Code section 17200 defines unfair competition as “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice * * *.” “The ‘unlawful’ practices prohibited by section 17200 are any practices forbidden by law, be it civil or criminal, federal, state, or municipal, statutory, regulatory, or court made. It is not necessary that the predicate law provide for private civil enforcement. As our Supreme Court put it, section 17200 ‘borrows’ violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices independently actionable under section 17200 et seq. ‘Unfair’ simply means any practice whose harm to the victim outweighs its benefits. ‘Fraudulent,’ as used in the statute, does not refer to the common law tort of fraud but only requires a showing members of the public “are likely to be deceived.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff contends the second cause of action states several forms of unfair competition associated with defendants’ use of general releases, to wit: (1) imposing unenforceable contract terms; (2) using release forms likely to mislead the public; (3) causing the public to sign agreements they are not likely to understand; and (4) holding themselves out as competent while refusing to accept responsibility for their actions. Plaintiff argues the superior court erred in granting summary adjudication to Salomon, Breeze, Trimont, Atomic, and Marker as these defendants failed to negate all forms of unfair competition alleged.</p>
<p class="indent">Of the four categories of unfair competition relied upon by plaintiff, only the first, imposing unenforceable contract terms, requires more than a brief comment. In <span class="italic">People v. McKale</span>, the court concluded it was unfair competition for a mobile home park operator to require tenants to sign rules and regulations containing unlawful terms. Notwithstanding the defendant’s argument that these rules and regulations were not being enforced, the court explained: “When a mobilehome park operator requires tenants to sign park rules and regulations which the park is prohibited by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page464" class="pagebreak">464</span>law from enforcing, those tenants are likely to be deceived, and allegations of unfair competition based thereon are sufficient to withstand demurrer.”</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Baker Pacific</span>, the court held void as against public policy a release required as a condition of employment which contained terms violative of Civil Code section 1668. Civil Code section 1668 declares violative of public policy contracts which “have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from the responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent * * *.” Pursuant to the release at issue in <span class="italic">Baker Pacific</span>, a subscribing employee undertook to assume “all risks” of exposure to asbestos, covenanted not to sue “for, from and against any and all liability whatsoever,” and waived “any and all claims of every nature” relating to asbestos exposure. The court concluded this language “clearly includes a release from liability for fraud and intentional acts and thus on its face violates the public policy as set forth in Civil Code section 1668.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Baker Pacific</span> is inapposite. That decision rests on the existence of a public interest in the employer-employee relationship. Where the public interest is implicated, an agreement exempting a party from responsibility for negligence is void as against public policy.</p>
<p class="indent">When the public interest is not implicated, private parties are free among themselves to shift a risk elsewhere than where the law would otherwise place it. Such agreements, in the context of sporting or recreational activities, have consistently been enforced. In <span class="italic">Westlye</span>, we held the public interest does not preclude enforcement of an agreement to bar claims for negligent adjustment of ski bindings.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff’s reliance on <span class="italic">Westlye</span>, as it relates to strict liability claims, is also misplaced. Assuming defendants were under a legal obligation to modify their releases in accordance with <span class="italic">Westlye</span>, nearly all did so during the pendency of this proceeding. For example, the original release of Salomon included “any claim based upon negligence, breach of warranty, contract, claim of product defect or other legal theory.” As modified, the release reads, “any claim based upon negligence, breach of warranty, contract, or other legal theory.” Atomic, whose original release did not mention product defect or strict liability, added language reading: “This document is a legally binding contract which is in[t]ended to provide a comprehensive release of liability, but is not intended to assert any claims or defenses which are prohibited by law.”</p>
<p class="indent">The lone exception is Marker, whose modified release encompasses all claims based on “negligence, breach of warranty, strict products liability or any other legal theories.” However, Marker’s modified release also states: “This document * * * is intended to provide a comprehensive release of liability, but it is not intended to assert any claims of defenses which are prohibited by law. The specific rights of the parties may vary from state to state.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page465" class="pagebreak">465</div>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff contends the modified releases are unlawful despite these changes because they are ambiguous regarding product defect or strict liability claims. Plaintiff insists defendants’ releases must expressly exclude such claims. As we shall explain, post, defendants are under no duty to outline in their releases the details of their customers’ legal rights. As long as the releases do not expressly include strict liability claims or, alternatively, do exclude claims prohibited by law, which in this state would embrace strict liability claims, they comply with the decision in <span class="italic">Westlye</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff argues that modification to comply with <span class="italic">Westlye</span> does not preclude injunctive relief to prohibit repetition of past misconduct. Defendants concede an injunction may be issued to prevent recurrence of past misconduct. However, even assuming the use of the old releases was actionable, Business and Professions Code section 17203 provides a court “may” enjoin any person who has engaged in unfair competition. The trial court presumably chose not to exercise this power and we find no abuse of discretion under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">We now consider plaintiff’s theory the releases are unlawful because they are unconscionable. Plaintiff argues the agreements skiers are required to sign are contracts of adhesion which are objectively unreasonable under the circumstances presented. Specifically, he cites the sweeping use of releases in the ski industry and the unreasonableness of shifting the risk of injury away from the only party in a position to protect against it.</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming the doctrine of unconscionability may be used affirmatively as the predicate of an unfair competition claim, it is inapplicable here. Unconscionable agreements typically involve contractual provisions which operate in a harsh and one-sided manner without any justification. They have both a procedural and a substantive element. “The procedural element focuses on two factors: oppression and surprise. Oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice. Surprise involves the extent to which the terms of the bargain are hidden in a ‘prolix printed form’ drafted by a party in a superior bargaining position. Substantive unconscionability inquires into whether the one-sidedness of an agreement is objectively justified. This component is tied to procedural unconscionability and requires a balancing test, such that “the greater the unfair surprise or inequality of bargaining power, the less unreasonable the risk reallocation which will be tolerated.’”</p>
<p class="indent">For purposes of defendants’ summary adjudication motions, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Based on this evidence, and the reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, the ultimate question of unconscionability is one of law which we consider de novo.</p>
<p class="indent">There is nothing inherently unreasonable in skiers agreeing with ski equipment distributors or service providers to allocate to skiers the risk of injury from failure of a ski binding to release properly. Skiers already assume the risks inherent in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page466" class="pagebreak">466</span>sport. The releases at issue deal with risks associated with negligent acts which increase the risks inherent in skiing. Furthermore, consumers are not denied a meaningful choice by virtue of the common use of releases. Their choice to ski already exposes them to a number of risks inherent in that activity. Skiing, like other athletic or recreational pursuits, however beneficial, is not an essential activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, even assuming an inequality of bargaining power, there is no credible evidence release agreements are a surprise to skiers. The agreements themselves are short and the pertinent release language is as prominent as other language in the form. There is no evidence defendants conceal or misrepresent the language of the release in order to obscure its effect. Given the prevalence of releases in sporting and recreational activities, the failure of defendants to utilize releases of liability would be the greater surprise.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that under appropriate circumstances we would not find a broadly or vaguely worded release unconscionable. However, such a determination must await those circumstances. Courts do not render advisory opinions. Courts deal with actual, not hypothetical, controversies. All we conclude here is that it is not unconscionable for ski equipment distributors and retailers to require and use the releases at issue as a condition for doing business with them.</p>
<p class="indent">We turn now to plaintiff’s alternative theories of unfair competition. Plaintiff contends defendants’ practices are likely to mislead the public regarding their legal rights and cause customers to sign releases they do not understand. However, the complaint alleges only that defendants require customers to sign releases. It alleges no conduct by which defendants mislead their customers or cause them to sign documents they do not comprehend. Nor has plaintiff presented any such evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">In order effectively to exculpate a tortfeasor from liability for future negligence or other misconduct, a release “must be clear, unambiguous and explicit in expressing the intent of the parties.” “Such an agreement, read as a whole, must clearly notify the prospective releasor or indemnitor of the effect of signing the agreement.” A release effective as to one type of misconduct may not be effective as to another.</p>
<p class="indent">The mere fact a release is not sufficiently clear to be enforceable under all conceivable circumstances does not render its use unfair competition. We are aware of no general duty owed by one contracting party to another to explain the other’s legal rights in connection with the agreement. We will not presume a contracting party who is uncertain regarding the breadth of a release will interpret the document broadly and thereby forego relief which would otherwise be available. We assume contracting parties are aware of their legal rights or will seek competent legal assistance where necessary. It is pure speculation a party faced with a release which may or may not cover a given injury will forego the possibility of redress.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page467" class="pagebreak">467</div>
<p class="indent">This does not change merely because the party obtaining a release of liability holds himself out as competent to perform the task in question. While it may be good business to stand behind one’s work, this is not an obligation imposed by law absent other circumstances.</p>
<p id="sec207" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Should companies seeking release agreements like the ski binding manufacturers have a dual pricing system? If you release them of all liability, you can rent skis for $20, but if you wish to retain your right to sue, you must pay $100. Would anyone really pay $80 more just for an intangible right to sue?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If ski shops can agree with their customers that they will not be liable to the customer for negligently adjusted ski bindings, why shouldn’t lawyers be able to agree with their clients that the lawyer will “do his best” but will not be liable for the negligent preparation of a legal document?</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p id="sec208" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Leon v. Family Fitness Center</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Court of Appeal, 1998.</p>
<p class="sectionb">61 Cal.App.4th 1227, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 923.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ W<small>ORK</small>, A<small>CTING</small> P<small>RESIDING</small> J<small>USTICE</small>. Carlos Leon appeals a summary judgment entered in favor of Family Fitness Center, Inc. (Family Fitness) in his negligence action for personal injuries sustained when a bench collapsed beneath him while using the sauna at Family Fitness. Leon contends the trial court erroneously concluded there were no triable issues of material fact regarding whether the liability release contained in the retail installment contract he signed was legally adequate to exculpate Family Fitness from its own negligence and whether the release was obtained by fraud or overreaching in its inception. On de novo review, we conclude the purported release is neither sufficiently conspicuous nor unambiguous to insulate Family Fitness from liability to Leon for injuries received when its sauna bench collapsed. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">F<small>ACTUAL AND</small> P<small>ROCEDURAL</small> B<small>ACKGROUND</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Carlos Leon signed a Club Membership Agreement (Retail Installment Contract) on June 1993 and thereafter became a member of Family Fitness. The membership agreement is a legal-length single sheet of paper covered with writing front and back. The front page is divided into two columns, with the right-hand column containing blanks for insertion of financial and “Federal Truth in Lending” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page468" class="pagebreak">468</span>data plus approximately 76 lines of text of varying sizes, some highlighted with bold print. The left-hand column contains approximately 90 lines of text undifferentiated as to size, with no highlighting and no paragraph headings or any other indication of its contents. The back of the agreement contains approximately 90 lines of text. The exculpatory clause is located at the bottom of the left-hand column of the front page and states the following:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">Buyer is aware that participation in a sport or physical exercise may result in accidents or injury, and Buyer assumes the risk connected with the participation in a sport or exercise and represents that Member is in good health and suffers from no physical impairment which would limit their use of FFC’s facilities. Buyer acknowledges that FFC has not and will not render any medical services including medical diagnosis of Member’s physical condition. Buyer specifically agrees that FFC, its officers, employees and agents shall not be liable for any claim, demand, cause of action of any kind whatsoever for, or on account of death, personal injury, property damage or loss of any kind resulting from or related to Member’s use of the facilities or participation in any sport, exercise or activity within or without the club premises, and Buyer agrees to hold FFC harmless from same.</p>
<p class="indent">In January 1994, Leon sustained head injuries when a sauna bench on which he was lying collapsed beneath him at Family Fitness. After Leon filed an action for personal injuries against Family Fitness, the trial court granted summary judgment for Family Fitness based on its defense of release.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Summary judgment is proper only where there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. “On review of a summary judgment in favor of the defendant, we review the record de novo to determine whether the defendant has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiff’s case or demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial.” Although we must strictly construe the moving party’s papers and liberally construe those of the opposing party, the latter bears the burden of showing triable issues of fact exist. We resolve all doubts in favor of the party opposing the judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">“An express release is not enforceable if it is not easily readable.” [citations omitted] “Furthermore, the important operative language should be placed in a position which compels notice and must be distinguished from other sections of the document. A [layperson] should not be required to muddle through complex language to know that valuable, legal rights are being relinquished.” [citations omitted] An exculpatory clause is unenforceable if not distinguished from other sections, if printed in the same typeface as the remainder of the document, and if not likely to attract attention because it is placed in the middle of a document. In other words, a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page469" class="pagebreak">469</span>release must not be buried in a lengthy document, hidden among other verbiage, or so encumbered with other provisions as to be difficult to find.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The trial court found the exculpatory clause was sufficiently conspicuous, citing only that it is written in 8–point type as required for retail installment contracts by Civil Code section 1803.1 and stated in plain and simple language. Although print size is an important factor, it is not the only one to be considered in assessing the adequacy of a document as a release. The court failed to address specifically other relevant characteristics of the exculpatory clause—its size, form and location within the undifferentiated paragraph in which it appears. In fact, Civil Code section 1803.2 requires warnings to protect consumers’ financial interests from potential hazards in retail installment contracts by providing notice in larger, bold-face type (14, 12 or 10 point). Clearly, Civil Code section 1803.1’s perfunctory mandate that all retail installment sales contracts be at least in 8–point type, is not legislative acknowledgement that 8–point type alone is per se evidence of adequate conspicuousness so as to universally relieve a party of liability for its general negligence. Indeed, Civil Code section 1812.85 requires even a provision of lesser import, a cancellation clause in contracts for health services offered by facilities such as Family Fitness, to be at least 10–point boldface print.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the release clause, although a separate paragraph, is in undifferentiated type located in the middle of a document. Although some other portions are printed in bold and in enlarged print, the releasing paragraph is not prefaced by a heading to alert the reader it is an exculpatory release, contains no bold lettering, and is in the same smaller font size as is most of the document. No physical characteristic distinguishes the exculpatory clause from the remainder of the document. The document itself is titled “Club Membership Agreement (Retail Installment Contract)” giving no notice to the reader it includes a release or waiver of liability. Of particular relevance, there is no language to alert a reader Family Fitness intended the release to exculpate it from claims based on its own negligence. Where such exculpation is sought, the release must contain specific words “clearly and explicitly expressing such intent.”</p>
<p class="indent">To be valid and enforceable, a written release purporting to exculpate a tortfeasor from damage claims based on its future negligence or misconduct must clearly, unambiguously, and explicitly express this specific intent of the subscribing parties. “If a tortfeasor is to be released from such liability the language used ‘must be clear, explicit and comprehensible in each of its essential details. Such an agreement, read as a whole, must clearly notify the prospective releasor or indemnitor of the effect of signing the agreement.’”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page470" class="pagebreak">470</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The membership agreement signed by Leon is prefaced with an assumption of the risk statement. The general release is unobtrusively inserted thereafter. Although some courts have treated the two interchangeably others have separately analyzed the enforceability of either. Whether taken separately or analyzed as a whole, we conclude the general release statement is fatally ambiguous.</p>
<p class="indent">The Restatement Second of Torts states: “In order for the agreement to assume the risk to be effective, it must also appear that its terms were intended by both parties to apply to the particular conduct of the defendant which has caused the harm. Again, where the agreement is drawn by the defendant and the plaintiff passively accepts it, its terms will ordinarily be construed strictly against the defendant.” (Rest., Torts, § 496B, com. d, p. 566.) In its most basic sense, assumption of risk means that one person, in advance, has given his express consent to relieve another of obligations toward himself, and to assume the chance of injury from a known risk arising from what the other defendant is to do or leave undone. The result is the other person is relieved of a legal duty to the plaintiff; and being under no duty, he cannot be charged with negligence solely based on the occurrence of the event anticipated.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, an individual who understandingly entered into the membership agreement at issue can be deemed to have waived any hazard known to relate to the use of the health club facilities. These hazards typically include the risk of a sprained ankle due to improper exercise or overexertion, a broken toe from a dropped weight, injuries due to malfunctioning exercise or sports equipment, or from slipping in the locker-room shower. On the other hand, no Family Fitness patron can be charged with realistically appreciating the risk of injury from simply reclining on a sauna bench. Because the collapse of a sauna bench when properly utilized is not a “known risk,” we conclude Leon cannot be deemed to have assumed the risk of this incident as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Family Fitness membership agreement contained a general release or hold harmless provision as well. “Where a participant in an activity has expressly released the defendant from responsibility for the consequences of any act of negligence, the law imposes no requirement that the participant have had a specific knowledge of the particular risk which resulted in his death [or injury.] Not every possible specific act of negligence by the defendant must be spelled out in the agreement or discussed by the parties. Where a release of all liability for any act of negligence is given, the release applies to any such negligent act, whatever it may have been. It is only necessary that the act of negligence, which results in injury to the releaser, be reasonably related to the object or purpose for which the release is given.” Here, Family Fitness’s negligence was not reasonably related to the object <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page471" class="pagebreak">471</span>or purpose for which the release was given, that is, as stated, injuries resulting from participating in sports or exercise rather than from merely reclining on the facility’s furniture.</p>
<p class="indent">The objective purpose of the release Leon signed was to allow him to engage in fitness activities within the Family Fitness facilities. However, it was not this type of activity which led to his injury. Leon allegedly was lying on a fixed, non-movable, permanent bench in the sauna room. Injuries resulting during the proper use of the bench would no more be expected to be covered by the clause than those caused by the ceiling falling on his head or from a prat fall caused by a collapsing office chair. These incidents have no relation to an individual’s participation in a health club’s fitness regimen.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, the release is ineffective because, read as a whole, it does not clearly notify a customer of the effect of signing the agreement—it was not clear, unambiguous and explicit. The release begins with language that participation in a sport or physical exercise may result in accidents or injury, and buyer assumes the risk connected with the participation in such. The release is followed by a statement in large print and bold, capital letters: “MODERATION IS THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL FITNESS PROGRAM AND ALSO THE KEY TO PREVENTING INJURIES.” Family Fitness placed the general waiver between these two statements which deal strictly with the risks inherent in an exercise or sports program without any mention that it was intended to insulate the proprietor from liability for injuries caused by its own negligence.</p>
<p class="indent">Reading the entire document leads to the inescapable conclusion the release does not clearly, explicitly and comprehensibly set forth to an ordinary person untrained in the law, such as Leon, that the intent and effect of the document is to release claims for his own personal injuries resulting from the enterprise’s own negligent acts, regardless whether related to the sports or exercise activities it marketed.</p>
<p id="sec209" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The court distinguishes the collapse of the sauna bench from other “known risks” “inherent in an exercise or sports program.” Is this helpful? What if a weight bench collapsed beneath Mr. Leon? Isn’t this a “known risk” “inherent in an exercise or sports program”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Reread the waiver on p. 467. Isn’t it clear that Mr. Leon waived any claim arising from “Member’s use of the facilities”? What more does Family Fitness need to say to have members waive liability for collapsing sauna benches?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page472" class="pagebreak">472</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Is working out at Family Fitness more necessary than skiing? Would the <span class="italic">Olsen</span> court have decided this case differently, given their statement that “[s]kiing, like other athletic or recreational pursuits, however beneficial, is not an essential activity”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Consider California Civil Code § 1542 at p. 461. Doesn’t this statute apply to both <span class="italic">Olsen</span> and <span class="italic">Leon</span>? In light of this statute, how can one ever effectively release claims prior to suffering any injury? Note that California courts permit parties to expressly waive the protections of § 1542 and that in fact such waivers are commonly included in forms of release. What is the point of a statute that prohibits release of unknown claims absent express waiver? Is it simply a trap for unwary releasees?</p>

Such limitations should at least be given effect against a claim over by a dealer who is held to such altered or additional obligation by his customer. Whether a consumer should be entitled to claim directly against the manufacturer in such a case depends on whether an agency relationship (express or apparent) can reasonably be spelled out. The problem ties into that arising when a dealer warrants that a product is fit for a use not reasonably encompassed by the nature of the product. In such a case, a remote seller’s defense of no privity to a consumer claim based on product failure under the stress of such special use makes some sense.</p>

We note, however, that in the analogous case of overly broad covenants not to compete, courts have tended to invalidate rather than restrict such covenants when it appears they were drafted in bad faith, i.e., with a knowledge of their illegality. The reason for this rule is that if such bad faith restrictive covenants are enforced, then “employers are encouraged to overreach; if the covenant they draft is overbroad then the court [will redraft] it for them.” This reasoning applies with equal force to arbitration agreements that limit damages to be obtained from challenging the violation of unwaivable statutory rights. An employer will not be deterred from routinely inserting such a deliberately illegal clause into the arbitration agreements it mandates for its employees if it knows that the worst penalty for such illegality is the severance of the clause after the employee has litigated the matter. In that sense, the enforcement of a form arbitration agreement containing such a clause drafted in bad faith would be condoning, or at least not discouraging, an illegal scheme, and severance would be disfavored unless it were for some other reason in the interests of justice. The refusal to enforce such a clause is also consistent with the rule that a party may waive its right to arbitration through bad faith or willful misconduct. Because we resolve this case on other grounds, we need not decide whether the state of the law with respect to damages limitations was sufficiently clear at the time the arbitration agreement was signed to lead to the conclusion that this damages clause was drafted in bad faith.</p>

As will be seen, about fifteen months later the equity based on the $550,000 figure was worth, roughly, $120,000. The record does not indicate why there was such a big change in such a relatively short time. Presumably, at least part of it is due to payments on the encumbrances.</p>

<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-85" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_85" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>.  The rule is stated in section 505 of the Restatement. In comment (a) it said: “ * * * Reformation where it is available for mutual mistake precludes a power of avoidance of the contract. On the other hand, where a reformation is based on mistake of one party and fraud of the other the defrauded party has also as an alternative the power of avoidance.” In 42 Cal.Jur.2d “Reformation” section 31, the authors cite the Restatement comment for the proposition that “knowledge or reason on the part of one party to suspect that the other’s intention is something different from that which the writing expresses affords ground for reformation, but not for avoidance.” No cases are cited to support this startling announcement which rests, of course, on a misreading of the Restatement.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-86" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_86" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>.  Above we suggested that Tim’s attorney possibly justified his actions morally by the fact that the figure in the counter offer was based on, as he put it, “something like a $450,000 value.” Actually the offer was not based on such a value but on, to be precise, a value of $448,526.99. If Tim’s attorney also spotted the mistake which Joan’s attorney made when dividing $141,637.01 by 2 and coming up with $70,081.85, it becomes rather obvious that he was not making an offer based on $450,000, but rather thought to lull Joan by repeating the mathematical error. In fairness, however, it should be noted that the evidence is susceptible of the interpretation that the attorney knew of the $100,000 mistake, but not of the other. It seems unlikely, however, that the latter escaped the attention of the accountant.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-87" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/16_chapter05.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_87" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a>.  Assuming for purposes of discussion that the error is “information relating to [the] representation,” under Rule 1.6 disclosure would be “impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation.” The Comment to Rule 1.6 points out that a lawyer has implied authority to make “a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion”—in this case completing the commercial contract already agreed upon and left to the lawyers to memorialize. We do not here reach the issue of the lawyer’s duty if the client wishes to exploit the error.</p>

<p class="fn_txt1">(1) Where a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party unless he bears the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in § 296.</p>
<p class="fn_txt">The exceptions in § 296 are not here applicable.</p>

Plaintiff received no notice that the judge intended to decide this case on the basis of the alleged trade usage.</p>

However, the second edition was published subsequent to the issuance of the lower court opinion and the filing of the briefs with this Court. Thus, we take it upon ourselves to refer to the latest edition to aid us in our resolution of this case.</p>
