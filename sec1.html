<p class="indent">There is no perfect reported case to begin a course in contract law. Judges rarely write opinions with the needs of law students uppermost in their minds.

Southland</span>, the opinions in which have been written by a court composed of frustrated Contracts professors.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p id="sec4" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Best Construction Co. v. Southland Construction Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Supreme Court of Southland, 2017.</p>
<p class="sectionb">57 Sthld. 362.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ R<small>OBQUIST</small>, C.J. Southland Construction Company (“Southland”), the defendant in the trial court, appeals from the grant of summary judgment against it in this contract action brought by Best Construction Company (“Best”). The complaint alleges that Southland’s failure to provide Best with 50,000 square feet of ¾ inch waterproof concrete-form plywood panels, as it had promised, was a breach of an enforceable contract causing damages to Best in the amount of $5,000. The trial court found that the pleadings raised no material issues of fact requiring trial and that Southland’s promise gave rise to an enforceable contract which Southland totally failed to perform. It therefore granted summary judgment to Best for the $5,000 damages it claimed.</p>
<p class="indent">Best and Southland have been engaged in the construction business in and around Southland City for many years. Both use large quantities of construction grade plywood, including the ¾ inch waterproof concrete-form plywood in question. Both companies maintain inventories of these items, which they purchase from plywood mills in carload lots of approximately 50,000 square feet per car. Plywood <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page14" class="pagebreak">14</span>purchased this way is, of course, substantially less expensive than if purchased in smaller quantities from a local lumber yard.</p>
<p class="indent">On June 11, 2005, Best’s general superintendent discovered that its supply of concrete-form plywood was far short of what it would need on the Security Bank job it was about to start. Only an insignificant inventory was available in Best’s warehouse. Management was advised of the problem, and G.H. Burke, Best’s vice president and purchasing manager, immediately ordered two carloads from a mill in the State of Washington at a price of $290 per thousand feet, delivered at Southland City.</p>
<p class="indent">This order did not solve Best’s problem, however, because delivery from the mill could not be expected for six to eight weeks and construction was due to start on the foundation of the 20–story Security Bank building within ten days. Best could have purchased the plywood it needed for immediate delivery from various local lumber yards, but only at the local warehouse price of about $360 per thousand feet.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than incur this expense, Burke, on June 12, sought to borrow the plywood from other local construction companies. All of these companies maintain inventories of standard items. They are business competitors, but from time to time they help each other meet unexpected shortages if they conveniently can. Burke’s first call was to A.H. Stevens, vice president of defendant, Southland. According to the uncontroverted affidavits submitted in support of Best’s motion for summary judgment, Burke described Best’s shortage to Stevens and was told that Southland had recently received three carloads of the needed plywood and had an inventory far in excess of its foreseeable short-term needs. Burke and Stevens thereupon agreed that Best would send its trucks to Southland’s warehouse during the next three weeks, beginning on June 22, to pick up not more than 50,000 square feet of plywood as Best needed it on the job. In return, Burke promised to return the same quantity of similar plywood and have its employees re-pile it in Southland’s warehouse as soon as its carload shipments arrived. Stevens reminded Burke that “one good turn deserves another” and that he was helping out in the expectation that “Best would bail Southland out next time.” Burke assured Stevens that Best would make every effort to meet Southland’s inventory problem the next time one developed.</p>
<p class="indent">On June 19, Burke received a call from Stevens, who reported that Coastal Lumber Company, a retail supply yard, had offered Southland $352 per thousand square feet for its entire inventory of ¾ inch plywood. Coastal needed the material at once to fill pressing commitments to its local customers caused by a careless over-booking of orders by one of its sales representatives. Under the circumstances, Stevens said it was obvious that Southland couldn’t be expected to go through with the loan to Best.</p>
<p class="indent">During the last half of June, plywood prices advanced sharply. Improved economic conditions in the construction industry had increased demand and new <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page15" class="pagebreak">15</span>governmental conservation regulations on lumbering in national forests threatened to make supplies scarcer and more expensive. Burke tried in vain to find another contractor willing to help him out with a loan and finally purchased the needed plywood on June 20 from local lumber yards. The price from these sources had advanced to $390 per thousand square feet from the $360 price on June 12, when he had made his arrangement with Southland. Thus Best had to pay $1,500 more than if it would have had it purchased the plywood locally a week earlier instead of relying on Southland’s promise of a loan. It claimed $5,000 as damages, however, basing that claim on the $100 per thousand difference between the $390 it had to pay locally and the $290 cost to it of the carload plywood with which it would have repaid Southland’s loan. The $5,000 was awarded to Best by the court below.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial question raised by this contract claim is whether Southland promised Best that it would lend Best the plywood that it needed. Restatement, Second, Contracts § 1 states that a contract is <span class="bold">“a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.”</span> Contract law is indeed limited to the enforcement of promises.</p>
<p class="indent">The court below assumed that Southland made a promise. No reasonable person would interpret the conversation between Stevens and Burke as anything other than a request for an assurance that Southland would furnish the plywood Best needed, and the voluntary and conscious giving of that assurance by Stevens. That satisfies every recognized definition of promise, including the following language of § 2(1) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts: <span class="bold">“A promise is a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.”</span> Totally absent are such promise-destroying elements as illusoriness, vagueness, duress, lack of capacity, frivolity, fraud and mistake.</p>
<p class="indent">But the fact that Southland promised Best does not settle the matter. For implicit in the Restatement’s § 1 reference to contracts as “promises that the law will enforce” is the proposition that all promises are not enforceable. Is Southland’s such an unenforceable promise?</p>
<p class="indent">This was a transaction between businesspersons in a serious business context. We can quickly disregard such categories of nonenforceability as polite social commitments and family housekeeping arrangements which the law has felt are too trivial to bother with or too sensitive to meddle with. We can also disregard promises tainted by illegality. But we cannot so easily disregard that broad category of promises that are unenforceable because not “paid for,” <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, gift promises. For better or worse, the law of contracts—after a long period of groping for a base—settled on the bargain as the core of enforceability, and the essence of a bargain is <span class="italic">exchange.</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page16" class="pagebreak">16</span>Thus except in a relatively few special situations that need not concern us here, unless a promisor asks for and receives a sufficient price for the performance contained in his promise, the law will not hold him to it. The doctrine requiring a price is called consideration. As Blackstone put it in the eighteenth century:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A consideration of some sort or other is so absolutely necessary to the forming of a contract that a <span class="italic">nudum pactum,</span> or agreement to do or pay anything on one side, without any compensation on the other, is totally void in law; and a man cannot be compelled to perform it. As if one man promises to give another 100£, here there is nothing contracted for or given on the one side, and therefore there is nothing binding on the other. And, however a man may or may not be bound to perform it, in honour or conscience, which the municipal laws do not take upon them to decide; certainly those municipal laws will not compel the execution of what he had no visible inducement to engage for; and therefore our law has adopted the maxim of the civil law, that <span class="italic">ex nudo pacto non oritur actio.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">2 B<small>LACKSTONE</small>’<small>S</small> C<small>OMMENTARIES</small> 445 (1765).</p>
<p class="indent">The modern statement of this basic principle is to be found in § 71 of the Restatement which reads as follows:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 71 Requirement of Exchange; Types of Exchange.</span></h4>
<p class="list">(1) To constitute consideration, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for.</p>
<p class="list">(2) A performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise.</p>
<p class="list">(3) The performance may consist of</p>
<p class="list1">(a) an act other than a promise, or</p>
<p class="list1">(b) a forbearance, or</p>
<p class="list1">(c) the creation, modification or destruction of a legal relation.</p>
<p class="list">(4) The performance or return promise may be given to the promisor or to some other person. It may be given by the promisee or by some other person.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether there was consideration for Southland’s promise would seem at first glance to be easily answered in the affirmative because this promise was made in a commercial setting, where bargain is the norm. It is safe to infer that a promise made in a business setting is motivated by expectation of beneficial gain. But every businessperson’s requested price for a promise does not automatically qualify as a sufficient price to make that promise legally enforceable. Although the law is reluctant to question the adequacy of consideration, there must be at least <span class="italic">some</span> determinable value attached to a definitely requested price before it can qualify. And <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page17" class="pagebreak">17</span>where the price asked is—as it was here by Southland—a return assurance by the other party, that assurance must in turn qualify as a true promise if it is to have legal value.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case before us we have an excellent example of such a nonqualifying price. What did Southland expect from the assurance by Best that it requested as the price for its promise of a loan of plywood? Clearly it expected nothing more than the creation in Best of good will—or of moral obligation—that would influence Best to be equally generous and cooperative if Southland subsequently needed similar help. But such a hope can hardly be dignified by the term consideration. The books are full of cases in which it has been consistently held that mere requested expressions of appreciation or a warm glow generated in the breast of a gift promisor, or the promisor’s desire to demonstrate love and affection, or the creation of a moral obligation by an unselfish act are not sufficient to constitute consideration. Best’s sweeping statement about reciprocating in the future (for what? in what quantities? for how long? under what circumstances?) cannot be dignified with the title “promise.” If Southland had loaned the plywood to Best and had subsequently demanded a specific return loan from Best and Best had refused the request, could Best have been held in breach of an enforceable promise? To ask this question is to answer it.</p>
<p class="indent">Southland’s promise to lend plywood to Best must be held to be unenforceable because it is without sufficient consideration. The grant summary judgment to respondent by the court below is reversed and that court is directed to dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ K<small>ENTHOM</small>, J. I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the court below erred in granting the motion for summary judgment, but I must express my concern over the labored reasoning employed to reach that conclusion. In my view, the central issue is whether the communications between the parties contained a real promise, or as some of my colleagues would put it, whether there is an enforceable promise.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority notes that not all voluntary, serious and definite commitments, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, promises, are enforceable and that “after a long period of groping” the law has come to insist that a promise must be part of a bargain and exchange (as those terms are given meaning in the doctrine of consideration) to be enforced as a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">It is distressing to think that so important a matter as the enforcement of promises is merely the result of historical accident or of mindless “groping.” Doctrine—the ordered body of principle and rule—is a vital dimension of the law, but we should not apply it mechanically. We must be aware of its uses and limits and not reach out to use it in cases where it obscures, rather than explains, the basis of decision. My colleagues distinguish between enforceable and unenforceable promises. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page18" class="pagebreak">18</span>To me the term promise always implies a commitment and when its use is appropriate it always implies legal enforceability. If the conduct does not imply a commitment, it should not be called a promise.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority tells us that bargained-for promises are enforceable, but it fails to tell us why <span class="italic">only</span> bargained-for promises are enforceable. Certainly when stated in such extreme form the doctrine of consideration becomes an <span class="italic">ipse dixit</span>: Southland’s promise is unenforceable because the law does not enforce such promises. In extreme form the doctrine can be understood to suggest that the law will not enforce unbargained-for promises even if they are serious and sensible and have a powerful legitimate claim for enforcement. Moreover, this approach focuses all attention on what was given for the promise, treating the issue of enforceability as a matter that is independent of the promise itself.</p>
<p class="indent">The root of the difficulty is the majority’s distinction between non-promises and unenforceable promises. This distinction adds nothing but confusion to an already overly confused area. A better approach would be to look at all the facts and circumstances surrounding promissory language in one analytical operation to see whether that language objectively implies a serious and sensible voluntary commitment by the promisor in a context in which society permits private persons to make binding promises. If the words themselves imply no substantial commitment or are so conditioned that the promise is illusory, there is no contract. If there was no voluntary intelligent act because of duress, lack of capacity, or fraud, there is no contract if the victimized party elects to avoid it. If we find that the promise was to act illegally or that it was an arrangement—trivial or otherwise—outside the area where the law allows people to bind themselves by their promises, there is no contract. And there is no contract, if the behavior claimed to be contractual lacks the clear inducing motive to commitment that separates the serious promise from just talk, impulsive statement, social or family arrangement, or improvident “gift” promise subsequently repented. If we find a serious and sensible commitment and none of the mentioned constraints are present, we give it the legal force of a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">We are asked to decide whether Southland’s statement to Best was a serious promise. I agree with the majority that Southland’s words were definitely promissory. But seen in their total context, Southland’s statements provide too slender a basis for finding so rigid a commitment as Best seeks to enforce here. At most they amount to a casual accommodation. They lack the formality, specificity, and deliberation that mark the intentional promise. This conclusion is strengthened by the absence of any significant price paid by Best for Southland’s offer to lend plywood. But rather than endow that one factor with the talismanic significance it is given by the majority, I reach the same result on the common sense basis that there was simply no binding commitment intended by the parties in this case.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page19" class="pagebreak">19</div>
<p class="noindentt">■ K<small>AGAMAYOR</small>, J. I dissent. The majority dismisses by its reference to “special situations that need not concern us here” precisely such a special situation as is presented by this case. That special situation is covered by the Restatement which states:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 90 Promise Reasonably Inducing Action or Forbearance.</span></h4>
<p class="blockquote">A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.</p>
<p class="indent">Best’s reliance on Southland’s promise meets all of the tests set out in § 90. Best had every reason to rely, it did so rely to its damage, and injustice can now be avoided only by reimbursing Best for the loss caused by its justifiable reliance.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that there is authority holding that this doctrine should be used only to protect innocents who have trustingly relied on promises to make a gift. The parties involved here would scarcely qualify as “innocents,” nor is the gift aspect all that clear. But modern cases that follow the Restatement emphasize the degree to which obligations created by reliance can arise in a commercial setting.</p>
<p class="indent">By permitting Southland to escape on a “no consideration” technicality from an explicit promise to lend plywood to Best, we encourage conduct that will significantly impair the utility of promise in our economy. We should not be so willing to destroy sensible commercial relationships by insisting on legal niceties. If Southland had agreed to lend Best the plywood if Best paid or promised to pay $10, would that make Southland’s promise more enforceable? If one is to believe the majority, the answer must be “yes.” That, I submit, reduces contracting and commercial relations to a game with arbitrary and senseless rules. It revives the long discredited formalism of the common law which centuries ago gave magical enforcing power to language over substance. The consideration doctrine even today makes sense as a recognition of the central place of bargain in contract transactions. It loses that meaning when converted into an arid formalism.</p>
<p class="indent">The arrangement between Southland and Best was a serious and sensible arrangement between two businesses. Such arrangements should be strongly encouraged by protecting reliance on them. In this case, Best’s reliance amounted to the difference between the price at which it could have purchased the required plywood from a local source at the time Southland agreed to lend it, and what it had to pay such a source when Southland reneged on its promise—namely $1,500. This recovery is $3,500 less than that claimed by Best and awarded by the court below, namely the $5,000 representing the difference between Best’s $290 cost of replacement plywood from the mill and the $390 Best had to pay locally when Southland <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page20" class="pagebreak">20</span>reneged on its promise to lend. I would remand with instructions to award Best $1,500 in reliance damages.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ O’S<small>OUTER</small>, J., dissenting. The majority and concurring opinions spin fine already overrefined rules of contract liability. They conclude that defendant Southland is not liable for the substantial losses it has inflicted upon plaintiff, Best, by its deliberate acts. Nowhere do the majority or concurring opinions explain why contract should be a special island of immunity separated from the basic principles of human justice which declare that a wrongdoer is liable for injuries proximately caused by its acts, whether willful or negligent. Our Civil Code has long provided in § 1708: “Every person is bound, without contract, to abstain from injuring the person or property of another or infringing upon any of his or her rights.” To the same effect is § 3281 of the Civil Code, which for over a century has provided: “Every person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another, may recover from the person in fault a compensation therefor in money, which is called damages.”</p>
<p class="indent">Courts should recognize that failure to perform as promised may give rise to a cause of action under remedial tort concepts as well as under more restrictive concepts of promissory liability. Indeed, this recognition is a cornerstone of modern liability for defective products as well as professional malpractice. In both cases liability measured by tort standards arises regularly out of an essentially contractual relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">Contract liability is merely a subspecies of general civil liability for injury. Promises may give rise to liability for harm caused just as broader social obligations may create a basis for compensation to those injured by breach of a legal duty. An ironic consequence of the majority’s rigid adherence to synthetic categories of tort and contract is that those who commit no conscious wrong, but merely fail to meet a standard of care of which they may be only dimly aware, are subject to broad liability for consequences provided for negligence. In contrast, those who solemnly and deliberately undertake a promissory obligation which they willfully breach without a shadow of an excuse are held to liability for a much narrower range of consequences or, as in this case, may be exonerated from all liability. Surely this result is irrational and should be avoided by casting aside the conceptual artificialities that engendered it.</p>
<p class="indent">Anglo–American law during part of its history has tended to see tort and contract as two watertight compartments. Perhaps the pattern originated in the peculiarities of ancient common law procedure and forms of action. For at least three centuries, common law distinguished claims based on a promise, recognized in the writ of assumpsit, from other forms of trespass. This distinction undoubtedly was reinforced by the special history of American legal education. Since the days of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page21" class="pagebreak">21</span>Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell of the Harvard Law School more than a century ago, the first-year curriculum has treasured as its crowning jewel a Contracts course using the case method. Great treatises by professors Williston and Corbin and the monumental Restatements of Contracts of the American Law Institute have reinforced this tendency. The distinction is embedded in the organization of the West Publishing Company digest system that influences the way lawyers think and perceive problems. Everyone knows that contract law is found under one set of key numbers and tort law is found under another. Legal systems in most other advanced nations do not place such great emphasis on the distinction between tort and contract, and it is an open secret that our law, when pressed by a tough case, ignores it as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The appropriate factors for deciding whether defendant should be liable to plaintiff in this case are traditional and clear: (a) the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff, (b) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, (c) the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, (d) the closeness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered, (e) the moral blame attached to the defendant’s conduct, and (f) the policy of preventing future harm.</p>
<p class="indent">Since this case should be returned to the lower court for trial under appropriate standards, it is not necessary to anticipate its outcome. Nonetheless, it seems obvious that plaintiff has a substantial claim deserving trial and the majority errs in dismissing this action.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ O<small>HNO</small>, J., dissenting. I cannot join the Chief Justice’s opinion because it goes around in circles. First it defines contract in terms of legally enforceable promises and then uses this definition to decide whether this particular promise should be legally enforced. Nor can I join my sister Kagamayor in dissent, for she too reasons circularly when she proposes that promises should be legally enforced if they induce reasonable reliance. It is plain that the reasonableness of required reliance (especially in commercial contexts) must depend in large part on whether the promisee could confidently expect to enforce the reliance-inducing promise in court.</p>
<p class="indent">All this shows the folly of seeking some logically exclusive syllogism that will define the concept of contract with completeness and precision. We must not forget that the life of the law is not logic, but, as Holmes taught, experience. In my experience the legal conclusion that a contract exists is likely to rest less on whether some set of mechanical elements have been satisfied than on whether the transaction is—as Judge Cardozo so eloquently put it in <span class="italic">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff–Gordon</span>, 222 N.Y. 88 (1917)—“‘instinct with an obligation,’ when viewed as a whole and through the eyes of the community in which it was made.” The existence of a contract the law <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" class="pagebreak">22</span>should enforce is not determined by abstract rules, but by the fact of agreement as discerned in their particular context by the peers of those who made the deal.</p>
<p class="indent">The Uniform Commercial Code, which our legislature has adopted as the law of this state, recognizes this truth in defining “Contract” in § 1–201(12) to mean “<span class="bold">the total legal obligation which results from the parties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.”</span> “Agreement” is similarly defined in UCC § 1–201(3) to mean the <span class="bold">“bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance* * *.”</span> In other words, contract is found in the total context of the transaction by looking at the deal in its full setting.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chief Justice leads us up to the correct answer, and I join so much of his opinion as recognizes that contract depends on promises and exchange. We should start from the assumption that when people make solemn promises the law will expect that they keep them, for social order and peace rest upon the reliability of people’s undertakings, voluntarily assumed. And since, of course, not all words or acts that may look like promises are sufficiently promissory in substance to deserve the law’s attention, we look for other clues. Surely two kinds of promises deserving enforcement are: (a) those that reasonable persons regularly rely upon, and (b) those that sensible people think are worth paying for. When something significant has been exchanged for a promise, it would be unjust to let the promisor retain the benefit but repudiate the promise for which he has been paid. The concepts of reliance and consideration have these common sense roots and it is in this spirit that they should be applied.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us apply common sense to the facts of this case. The Chief Justice correctly finds in his opinion that Southland promised to lend the plywood in question to Best. Moreover, it is recognized that this promise was part of an exchange, although it is found that this exchange of promises does not provide adequate “consideration” because Best’s return assurance involved nothing more than a sense of “moral obligation” and a “vague hope.” Therefore, the majority concludes, the case is to be dismissed on the pleadings as a matter of law, and Best is not entitled to a trial to demonstrate the existence of a binding contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority may feel confident that Best’s assurance of reciprocity was of insufficient value to serve as adequate consideration, but I wonder how many hardheaded and practical businesspersons would share that view. Every businessperson knows that the goodwill of those with whom you deal repeatedly, the ability to call upon them for help when needed, and the prize of high reputation built from such cooperative behavior, are the most valuable assets that a businessperson can gain. Moreover, they are readily convertible over time into hard cash. The majority <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page23" class="pagebreak">23</span>may view Best’s assurances through the hard and flinty eyesight cultivated in lawyers from their first day in law school, but the law promises the parties an opportunity at trial to persuade their peers to a more sensible view.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority’s cynical hardness has another apparent flaw; it simply fails to explain Southland’s behavior. Adopting the majority’s perspective, we must look upon Southland as a cold-blooded, profit-maximizing entrepreneur. It is, in any event, hardly a charitable organization. So if it did not consider Best’s promise of reciprocity to be of value to it, why did it promise the loan in the first place? Certainly, the fact that it freely made a valuable promise in apparent exchange for the assurance of future cooperation must create some issue of fact precluding both summary judgment or dismissal of Best’s claim of a binding contract created by the exchange of valuable promises. The case should go back for a trial on these vital questions.</p>
<p id="sec5" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Why is there any question in this case? Shouldn’t all promises be kept? Isn’t it always wrong to break your word? If breaking a promise is wrong and causes harm, shouldn’t the law require the wrongdoer to perform its promise?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. On the other hand, why should any court be concerned with this transaction? Do people keep promises only if they will have to pay damages if they don’t? Why do bad people keep promises? How much does the possibility that, after years of litigation, the defendant will have to pay damages add?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Would you feel more strongly that Southland’s promise should be enforced if it had been put in writing?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Suppose that Southland agreed to sell the lumber rather than lend it. Same result? Would there be any question of consideration for Chief Justice Robquist? Should sales be enforceable but not loans?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. If Stevens of Southland had called Burke of Best fifteen minutes after he had agreed to lend the plywood and said: “Sorry, I’ve changed my mind,” would there have been anything for Best to complain about? If Best had delivered a $100 check to Southland for its promise to lend plywood, and fifteen minutes later Southland reneged but sent the check back undeposited, would Best have a valid complaint?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Do we want to encourage transactions of this sort? If so, how can we best do so? What is the likely impact on future social behavior if this case comes out one way or the other?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">7</span>. Would this case look the same if Burke had just found Southland on the internet and they had never done business together before? What is the relevance of the fact that they have a course of dealings over the years?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">8</span>. How significant to the decision of this case should be the general practices of the construction business in Southland City? If all of these companies customarily help each other out from time to time, isn’t Southland’s promise a firmer basis for reliance than it might otherwise be?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">9</span>. In this case Southland could accommodate Best only by forgoing a very valuable opportunity to sell the plywood at a handsome profit. Would you feel the same about the case if this element were absent? Suppose Southland has no good reason at all for not letting Best take the plywood. Suppose their refusal to fulfill the deal was based on spite or competitive zeal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">10</span>. If Best were to win this case, what would the appropriate remedy be? If Best had a legal right to the plywood, why didn’t it just send its workers and truck over to Southland’s yard and pick up its plywood? Should the judge order Southland to lend Best the plywood as promised?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">11</span>. If Southland is to be ordered to pay damages in this case, how should they be measured?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">12</span>. In this case the price of plywood increased sharply during the transaction. Suppose the price of plywood remained constant. Would Best have a claim for damages if Southland failed to perform?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">13</span>. How much will it cost Best to bring this lawsuit? If it recovers a judgment, will it be awarded the real costs of the suit? If it is very expensive to assert claims and to defend them in court, how will people’s promissory behavior be affected?</p>

<p id="sec7" class="notes"><span class="bold">HISTORICAL NOTE: WHAT IS THE COMMON LAW?</span></p>
<p class="indent">The common law historically refers to the law administered by the ancient English Royal Courts of Justice at Westminster. Following the Norman Conquest of England, the King’s power and the jurisdiction of the Royal Courts were restricted by the power of competing institutions. These included the courts of the Church, the manorial courts of the barons and other feudal overlords, the mercantile courts and a variety of independent local courts for cities, boroughs, and fairs. English political and legal history from the 11th to the 19th century is largely the stormy story of the gradual expansion and domination of secular national authority, epitomized by the King, over ecclesiastical, feudal, and local rivals.</p>
<p class="indent">The jurisdiction of the Royal Courts was limited to suits based upon certain clearly defined forms of action. Until the 19th century, a person who wanted to sue would have to obtain a writ from the Chancellor’s office based upon a form of action that fit the facts of his case. If there were no writs for this kind of a complaint, no suit could be brought. Each form of action carried with it its own set of remedies, its own rules of evidence and proof, and even its own mode of trial (battle, ordeal, trial by oath, jury). The basic Royal Court writs were related to the two essential interests of the King as chief feudal overlord; they were concerned primarily with land and keeping the peace.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the commercial age—apart from land transactions—few of the disputes we would classify as contract cases were within the purview of the Royal Courts. Some contract suits were heard by the mercantile courts and others by the ecclesiastical courts. Church courts were involved because one basic ground for the enforcement of promises was the religious obligation to keep oaths and to speak the truth. This development was stunted when those courts were ousted from jurisdiction early in the long fight between King and Church.</p>
<p class="indent">Some contracts, particularly those under seal, for a sum certain, or for specified goods, could be heard in the Royal Courts under a writ of debt or detinue or a writ of covenant. These forms of action grew out of real property law and were inadequate to meet the needs of claimants involved in commercial contracts. Among the disadvantages of using the forms of action of debt and detinue was that the defendant could demand a trial by wager of law. The lawsuit would be decided by a number of persons swearing to the justice of one party’s cause, rather than by an impartial jury based upon evidence. Such swearers became too readily available in the market.</p>
<p class="indent">Covenant and debt contributed to contract law, but most modern contract law developed through the other major basis of royal jurisdiction, the obligation to keep the peace. The tool with which this was done was the writ of trespass, a wonderfully flexible writ, whose descendants include not only the modern law of contracts, but torts and criminal law as well.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page26" class="pagebreak">26</div>
<p class="indent">Originally the writ of trespass was directed at injuries by forcible breaches of the peace, but by the 13th century one form of the writ became available in cases of nonviolent trespass. It was labeled “trespass on the special case.” Under it, a person might be liable for acting carelessly and causing injury to another. By the 14th century it was held that if a person undertook to do a particular act and performed it badly, recovery for ensuing injury could be had in trespass on the special case. The central concept was that the defendant had undertaken to act properly, and the central allegation in the writ, by which the form of action came to be known, was the Latin word “<span class="italic">assumpsit</span>,” meaning “he undertook.” Note that in this early form the action might describe either a claim of negligence (tort) or breach of promise (contract).</p>
<p class="indent">Gradually, the two divided, and by the 16th century assumpsit was clearly understood to be a contractual action. Also in the 16th century England’s commercial and economic situation began changing radically, and the pressures for legal tools to meet the needs of the new age increased. Assumpsit, like all actions in trespass, was subject to trial by jury, not ordeal or wager of law, and thus it was preferred. Early requirements that the undertaking be explicit were diluted by the courts’ increased willingness to imply the promise. The last major barrier was broken in <span class="italic">Slade’s Case</span> (1602) where the King’s Bench held: “Every contract executory imports in itself an assumpsit, for when one agrees to pay money or to deliver anything, thereby he assumes or promises to pay or deliver it.”</p>
<p class="indent">By this process the common law gained a basis for the enforcement of promises independent of semi-religious conceptions of the sanctity of promises. While the secular footing of the law is now firmly established, it remains difficult to articulate in one or two sentences <span class="bold"><span class="italic">why</span></span> promises are enforceable in our law.</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">The judges in <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span> all agree that a contract requires at a minimum some language or other behavior that is promissory—that communicates a serious commitment to future action or inaction on the part of at least one of the parties. These elements of futurity and commitment distinguish contracts from legal relationships created by property concepts or general obligations imposed by tort.</p>
<p class="indent">These defining characteristics of contract exclude those communications that import only flimsy or spurious commitments of future action or inaction. For example, “I promise to lend you the plywood unless I change my mind” is not a promise <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" class="pagebreak">27</span>because the statement itself negates firm commitment. Yet, no promises in the real world are absolute; futurity itself conditions every promise on the passage of time. The fact that a promise is conditioned by some contingency need not deprive the commitment of substance unless the likelihood of performance becomes so remote as to be valueless or the limiting event is so within the unbridled discretion of the promisor (“I will paint your house if I feel like it”) that no sensible person will deem it worthy of reliance.</p>
<p class="indent">Legal treatises label such statements illusory promises, a classification that includes both those promises that are conditioned by limitations so large they swallow the committing force of the promise and those promises conditioned on fanciful or highly unlikely events. The line between the real and the illusory is sometimes a difficult one to draw. Many promises are conditioned on acts or events over which the promisor has no control, but they nonetheless look, feel, and taste like serious deals.</p>
<p class="indent">You might think that identifying a promise is essentially a matter of the presence of particular words or symbols, such as, “I promise.” The definition of a promise in § 2 of the Restatement, Second, Contracts, p. 15, focuses on the impact of the promise on the promisee. A promise is a “manifestation of intention to act … so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.” You can tell whether something is a promise only by reference to its social, as opposed to its formal, content. The Restatement definition opens the process to promises that are unspoken but implied from acts of the promisor or the social context in which the promisor operates. Emphasizing what the promisor implies leads us to focus on the intention of the promisor. As the emphasis shifts to how the promisee, society, or the judge understands the promisor’s behavior, social custom and social expectations are applied to contract quite independently of what this particular promisor meant. In this way the process of interpretation and implication of meaning blends seamlessly into the process of legislation and the construction of social obligations in law.</p>

<p class="sectionb">Nebraska Supreme Court, 1984.</p>
<p class="sectionb">217 Neb. 282, 348 N.W.2d 842.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>AMBRIDGE</small>, D.J.</p>
<p class="indent">This is an appeal by plaintiff of a summary judgment entered by the trial court in favor of the defendant in an action for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">This appeal centers around the following provision contained in the “Hauling Contract” executed by the plaintiff and the defendant in October 1980:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">The Contractor [i.e., plaintiff] shall transport in the Contractor’s trucks <span class="italic">such tonnage of beets as may be loaded by the Company</span> [i.e., defendant] from piles at the beet receiving stations of the Company, and unload said beets at such factory or factories as may be designated by the Company. The term of this contract shall be from October 1, 1980, until February 15, 1981. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff, as an independent contractor, was obligated under the “Hauling Contract” to furnish certain insurance, suitable trucks and equipment, and all necessary labor, maintenance, fuel, and licenses required for his operations thereunder, and the compensation which he was to receive for his services was based solely upon the amount of beets which he transported, the rate per ton varying with the length of the haul.</p>
<p class="indent">It is undisputed that upon executing the hauling contract the plaintiff knew that the defendant had executed identical such contracts with other independent truckers who would also be hauling the defendant’s beets and that the plaintiff would therefore transport on his trucks only “such tonnage of beets as may be loaded by” the defendant upon the plaintiff’s trucks, not all of the beets “as may be loaded by” the defendant from piles at the defendant’s beet receiving stations. The plaintiff had been transporting beets under the contract for approximately 2 months when, in early December 1980, the defendant informed the plaintiff that his services would no longer be needed. The plaintiff does not claim that he was entitled to transport all of the beets, but he does contend that he was entitled to continue to haul until all of the beets had been transported to the factory, that the defendant did not allow him to do so, and that the defendant thereby wrongfully terminated the hauling contract, causing the plaintiff loss of profits, forced sale of his trucks at a loss, and other damages to be proved on trial. In his petition the plaintiff predicated his action against the defendant upon the hauling contract. The defendant in its amended answer thereto alleged, among other defenses not relevant to the disposition of this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page29" class="pagebreak">29</span>appeal, that the defendant was not obligated under the contract to allow the plaintiff to haul any particular amount of tonnage and that its determination that it would no longer require the plaintiff’s services was a determination which was within the defendant’s discretion under the terms of the contract….</p>
<p class="indent">Considering the words contained therein together with the aforesaid undisputed facts known to both the plaintiff and the defendant when they executed the hauling contract, it is clear that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant intended to or did, either in fact or law, promise to transport a specific quantity of beets or promise to transport beets during a specific period of time. The term of the contract set forth therein, i.e., October 1, 1980, until February 15, 1981, did not constitute a promise, but merely established the period of time during which the promises which were contained in the contract would be in effect. Although the plaintiff made a number of promises in the hauling contract, all centered around the plaintiff’s promise to transport beets as loaded by the defendant on the plaintiff’s trucks during the period of October 1, 1980, through February 15, 1981, the defendant made no promises at all other than the promise to pay for the transportation of those beets which were in fact loaded by the defendant onto the trucks of the plaintiff during that period. An agreement which depends upon the wish, will, or pleasure of one of the parties is unenforceable….</p>
<p class="indent">Where a promisor agrees to purchase services from the promisee on a per unit basis, but the agreement specifies no quantity and the parties did not intend that the promisor should take all of his needs from the promisee, there is no enforceable agreement, and the promisor is not obligated to accept any services from the promisee and may terminate the relationship at any time without liability other than to pay for the services accepted. The fact that the promisor has accepted services from the promisee in the past under such an agreement does not furnish the consideration necessary to require the promisor to accept such services in the future under the agreement. Nor does the specification in such an agreement of the period of time during which it will be operative impose an obligation that is not already present under the agreement. Applying the foregoing to this case, it is apparent that the right of the defendant to control the amount of beets loaded onto the plaintiff’s trucks was in effect a right to terminate the contract at any time, and this rendered the contract as to its unexecuted portions void for want of mutuality. In the absence of a specification of quantity, the defendant had no obligation to use any of the plaintiff’s services, and the defendant’s decision to cease using those services after a certain point is not actionable.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff contends that prior actions of the defendant constituted a course of conduct which caused the plaintiff to justifiably believe that the defendant would permit the plaintiff to haul beets until all of the same had been transported from the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page30" class="pagebreak">30</span>receiving stations to the factory. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 223 provides:</p>
<p class="list_alphal">(1) A course of dealing is a sequence of previous conduct between the parties to an agreement which is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.</p>
<p class="list_alphal">(2) Unless otherwise agreed, a course of dealing between the parties gives meaning to or supplements or qualifies their agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">That principle of law is of no avail to the plaintiff in this case. The evidence is undisputed that prior to the plaintiff’s execution of the hauling contract of October 1980, there had been no similar course of dealing between the plaintiff and the defendant and that the course of dealing had between the defendant and other parties in preceding years, as well as for the year 1980, clearly established that independent truckers such as the plaintiff who had less seniority than others with hauling contracts were let go prior to completion of the beet haul.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec11" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Why did the parties make this agreement? What purpose did it serve? Did this agreement serve its function for Great Western? Did it serve its function for Mr. De Los Santos if it is not judicially enforceable?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Does this decision mean that there never was a time when Mr. De Los Santos and Great Western had a contract? Suppose that after Mr. De Los Santos has carried loads of beets for two months, Great Western refused to pay him. Could the sugar company avoid payment on grounds that there was no contract? Suppose the Company loaded a truck full of beets and Mr. De Los Santos took them away but failed to deliver them at the sugar refinery. Could he avoid Great Western’s claim for damages on grounds that there was no contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Suppose Mr. De Los Santos fails to show up and Great Western can’t find another driver. Would Mr. De Los Santos be liable for damages? Suppose the weather is terrible and Mr. De Los Santos tells Great Western, “I can carry beets tomorrow, but only at twice the contract price.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Suppose Great Western has lots of beets to haul but won’t give Mr. De Los Santos any because the dispatcher has a personal feud with him. Is there an implied promise of fairness that would give Mr. De Los Santos a claim?</p>

<p id="sec12" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Mattei v. Hopper</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Supreme Court, 1958.</p>
<p class="sectionb">51 Cal.2d 119, 330 P.2d 625.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ">■ S<small>PENCE</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indentn">Plaintiff brought this action for damages after defendant allegedly breached a contract by failing to convey her real property in accordance with the terms of a deposit receipt which the parties had executed. After a trial without a jury, the court concluded that the agreement was “illusory” and lacking in “mutuality.” From the judgment accordingly entered in favor of defendant, plaintiff appeals.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff was a real estate developer. He was planning to construct a shopping center on a tract adjacent to defendant’s land. For several months, a real estate agent attempted to negotiate a sale of defendant’s property under terms agreeable to both parties. After several of plaintiff’s proposals had been rejected by defendant because of the inadequacy of the price offered, defendant submitted an offer. Plaintiff accepted on the same day.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties’ written agreement was evidenced on a form supplied by the real estate agent, commonly known as a deposit receipt. Under its terms, plaintiff was required to deposit $1,000 of the total purchase price of $57,500 with the real estate agent, and was given 120 days to “examine the title and consummate the purchase.” At the expiration of that period, the balance of the price was “due and payable upon tender of a good and sufficient deed of the property sold.” The concluding paragraph of the deposit receipt provided: “Subject to Coldwell Banker &amp; Company obtaining leases satisfactory to the purchaser.” This clause and the 120–day period were desired by plaintiff as a means for arranging satisfactory leases of the shopping center buildings prior to the time he was finally committed to pay the balance of the purchase price and to take title to defendant’s property.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff took the first step in complying with the agreement by turning over the $1,000 deposit to the real estate agent. While he was in the process of securing the leases and before the 120 days had elapsed, defendant’s attorney notified plaintiff that defendant would not sell her land under the terms contained in the deposit receipt. Thereafter, defendant was informed that satisfactory leases had been obtained and that plaintiff had offered to pay the balance of the purchase price. Defendant failed to tender the deed as provided in the deposit receipt.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, defendant’s thesis that the deposit receipt constituted no more than an offer by her, which could only be accepted by plaintiff notifying her that all of the desired leases had been obtained and were satisfactory to him, must be rejected. Nowhere does the agreement mention the necessity of any such notice. Nor does the provision making the agreement “subject to” plaintiff’s securing “satisfactory” leases necessarily constitute a condition to the existence of a contract. Rather, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page32" class="pagebreak">32</span>whole purchase receipt and this particular clause must be read as merely making plaintiff’s performance dependent on the obtaining of “satisfactory” leases. Thus a contract arose, and plaintiff was given the power and privilege to terminate it in the event he did not obtain such leases….</p>
<p class="indent">However, the inclusion of this clause, specifying that leases “satisfactory” to plaintiff must be secured before he would be bound to perform, raises the basic question whether the consideration supporting the contract was thereby vitiated. When the parties attempt, as here, to make a contract where promises are exchanged as the consideration, the promises must be mutual in obligation. In other words, for the contract to bind either party, both must have assumed some legal obligations. Without this mutuality of obligation, the agreement lacks consideration and no enforceable contract has been created. Or, if one of the promises leaves a party free to perform or to withdraw from the agreement at his own unrestricted pleasure, the promise is deemed illusory and it provides no consideration. Whether these problems are couched in terms of mutuality of obligation or the illusory nature of a promise, the underlying issue is the same—consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">While contracts making the duty of performance of one of the parties conditional upon his satisfaction would seem to give him wide latitude in avoiding any obligation and thus present serious consideration problems, such “satisfaction” clauses have been given effect. They have been divided into two primary categories and have been accorded different treatment on that basis. First, in those contracts where the condition calls for satisfaction as to commercial value or quality, operative fitness, or mechanical utility, dissatisfaction cannot be claimed arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously and the standard of a reasonable person is used in determining whether satisfaction has been received…. However, it would seem that the factors involved in determining whether a lease is satisfactory to the lessor are too numerous and varied to permit the application of a reasonable man standard as envisioned by this line of cases. Illustrative of some of the factors which would have to be considered in this case are the duration of the leases, their provisions for renewal options, if any, their covenants and restrictions, the amounts of the rentals, the financial responsibility of the lessees, and the character of the lessees’ businesses.</p>
<p class="indent">This multiplicity of factors which must be considered in evaluating a lease shows that this case more appropriately falls within the second line of authorities dealing with “satisfaction” clauses, being those involving fancy, taste, or judgment. Where the question is one of judgment, the promisor’s determination that he is not satisfied, when made in good faith, has been held to be a defense to an action on the contract. Although these decisions do not expressly discuss the issues of mutuality of obligation or illusory promises, they necessarily imply that the promisor’s duty to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page33" class="pagebreak">33</span>exercise his judgment in good faith is an adequate consideration to support the contract. None of these cases voided the contracts on the ground that they were illusory or lacking in mutuality of obligation….</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">If the foregoing cases and other authorities were the only ones relevant, there would be little doubt that the deposit receipt here should not be deemed illusory or lacking in mutuality of obligation because it contained the “satisfaction” clause. However, language in two recent cases led the trial court to the contrary conclusion. The first case, <span class="italic">Lawrence Block Co. v. Palston</span>, stated that the following two conditions placed in an offer to buy an apartment building would have made the resulting contract illusory: “O.P.A. Rent statements to be approved by Buyer” and “Subject to buyer’s inspection and approval of all apartments.” These provisions were said to give the purchaser “unrestricted discretion” in deciding whether he would be bound to the contract and to provide no “standard” which could be used in compelling him to perform. However, this language was not necessary to the decision….</p>
<p class="indent">The other case, <span class="italic">Pruitt v. Fontana</span>, presented a similar situation. The court concluded that the written instrument with a provision making the sale of land subject to the covenants and easements being “approved by the buyers” was illusory. It employed both the reasoning and language of <span class="italic">Lawrence Block Co.</span> in deciding that this clause provided no “objective criterion” preventing the buyers from exercising an “unrestricted subjective discretion” in deciding whether they would be bound. But again, this language was not necessary to the result reached. The buyers in <span class="italic">Pruitt</span> refused to approve all of the easements of record, and the parties entered into a new and different oral agreement….</p>
<p class="indent">While the language in these two cases might be dismissed as mere <span class="italic">dicta</span>, the fact that the trial court relied thereon requires us to examine the reasoning employed. Both courts were concerned with finding an objective standard by which they could compel performance. This view apparently stems from the statement in <span class="italic">Lawrence Block Co.</span> that “The standard ‘as to the satisfaction of a reasonable person’ does not apply where the performance involves a matter dependent on judgment.” By making this assertion without any qualification, the court necessarily implied that there is no other standard available. Of course, this entirely disregards those cases which have upheld “satisfaction” clauses dependent on the exercise of judgment. In such cases, the criterion becomes one of good faith. Insofar as the language in <span class="italic">Lawrence Block Co.</span> and <span class="italic">Pruitt</span> represented a departure from the established rules governing “satisfaction” clauses, they are hereby disapproved.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page34" class="pagebreak">34</div>
<p class="indent">We conclude that the contract here was neither illusory nor lacking in mutuality of obligation because the parties inserted a provision in their contract making plaintiff’s performance dependent on his satisfaction with the leases to be obtained by him.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment is reversed.</p>
<p id="sec13" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The courts in this case and in <span class="italic">De Los Santos</span>, refer to the parties by their roles in the trial court as “plaintiff” and “defendant.” This style contributes to the rather abstract tone of the opinion and may confuse readers. Mr. Mattei was a real estate developer; Ms. Hopper owned the property in question. Who brought this suit, Mr. Mattei or Ms. Hopper? In whose favor was the case decided in the trial court? Who wins on appeal? What will happen to the case after the appellate court decision? For example, is Mr. Mattei now entitled to the damages he asks, or will there have to be a further trial?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Does the likelihood that the “good faith” standard will be difficult to enforce against Mr. Mattei suggest that Ms. Hopper was given nothing of value for her promise to sell her land? Or does the contract give Ms. Hopper something of value and some security of expectation, although Mr. Mattei’s power to get out of the deal is broad?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Prior to their divorce, Tom Clancy, the best-selling author, and his wife, Wanda King, entered into a partnership agreement establishing a joint venture named “Tom Clancy’s Op-Center” for various book projects. After the couple divorced, Clancy sought to terminate the Op-Center venture in his discretion as managing partner of the joint venture. King sued alleging the termination was invalid. The court found that in exercising his rights under the partnership agreement, Clancy “only needed to act in good faith toward his business partners, even if such actions actually were adverse to the interests of [the partnership].” King proffered evidence that Clancy only wanted to end the Op-Center series in order to deprive her of financial benefits. The court in <span class="italic">Clancy v. King</span>, 954 A.2d 1092 (Md. 2008) drew on the hit comedy <span class="italic">Seinfeld</span> (“The Wig Master”) (NBC original television broadcast Apr. 4, 1996) to illustrate the limitation the good faith requirement places on the exercise of otherwise discretionary contractual right. In the episode, Jerry purchased a “returnable” jacket at a men’s clothing shop. The following discussion took place:</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: Excuse me, I’d like to return this jacket.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Clerk: Certainly. May I ask why?</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: For spite.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page35" class="pagebreak">35</div>
<p class="blockquoted">Clerk: Spite?</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: That’s right. I don’t care for the salesman that sold it to me.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Clerk: I don’t think you can return an item for spite.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: What do you mean?</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Clerk: Well, if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but I’m afraid spite doesn’t fit into any of our conditions for a refund.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: That’s ridiculous, I want to return it. What’s the difference what the reason is?</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Clerk: Let me speak with the manager … excuse me … Bob! (walks over to the manager and whispers)</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Bob: What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: Well, I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won’t take it back.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Bob: That’s true. You can’t return an item based purely on spite.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: Well, so fine then … then I don’t want it and then that’s why I’m returning it.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Bob: Well you already said spite so….</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Jerry: But I changed my mind.</p>
<p class="blockquoted">Bob: No, you said spite. Too late.’</p>
<p class="blockquote">The court wrote:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“In attempting to exercise his contractual discretion out of ‘spite,’ Jerry breached his duty to act in good faith towards the other party to the contract. Jerry would have been authorized to return the jacket if, in his good faith opinion, it did not fit or was not an attractive jacket.

<p class="indent">In many legal systems around the world, judges’ written decisions are stated in a very formal, often syllogistic, style that is intended to delineate the “grounds” or basis in law for the decision. The dominant style in the English-speaking world is quite different. Appellate decisions were, and in a few cases still are, rendered orally in a rather discursive narrative style, sometimes immediately after the judges have deliberated and decided the case. Unlike the practice in most of the world, it is common in English-speaking courts for the decision of a multi-judge court to be delivered by an individual judge, not as an anonymous, collective decision. Indeed, as you will soon read in the cases that follow, other judges on the panel are likely to add their personal views separately when they disagree with the court’s outcome (dissenting opinion) or with its reasoning (concurring opinion).</p>
<p class="indent">In other legal systems with highly structured logical forms of decision it may be a rather straightforward matter to identify the “grounds” for the decision (although the reader often may be left with the suspicion that the grounds given are an after-the-fact rationalization for the decision rather than the motivating reason that led to it). In the English-speaking style it is likely that the more candid the judge is in describing the mental process that led to the result, the more difficult it will be to extract an easily generalizable principle of law from it. The term <span class="italic">dicta</span> is frequently used in contrast to the “holding” of a judicial decision to indicate that some things a court says are central to the decision and other matters are merely commentary or supportive. When a court refers to another judicial statement as <span class="italic">dicta</span>, it usually is disapproving of that statement and denying its binding force on the case being decided.</p>

<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 1945.</p>
<p class="sectionb">150 F.2d 642.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>WAN</small>, J. This is an action for damages for breach of four alleged contracts under each of which the plaintiff was to deliver trap rock to an airport project “as required” and in accordance with delivery instructions to be given by the defendant. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page37" class="pagebreak">37</span>The breach alleged was the defendant’s refusal to request or accept delivery within a reasonable time after the date of the contracts, thereby depriving the plaintiff of profits it would have made in the amount of $10,000…. Upon the pleadings, consisting of complaint, answer and reply, the defendant moved to dismiss the action for failure of the complaint to state a claim or, in the alternative, to grant summary judgment for the defendant on the ground that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact. The contracts in suit were introduced as exhibits at the hearing on the motion. Summary judgment for the defendant was granted on the theory that the defendant’s reservation of an unrestricted power of cancellation caused the alleged contracts to be wholly illusory as binding obligations. The plaintiff has appealed.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff owned and operated a trap rock quarry in Trumbull, Conn. Through the Treasury Department, acting by its State Procurement Office in Connecticut, the United States invited bids on trap rock needed for the Mollison Airport, Bridgeport, Conn. The plaintiff submitted four bids for different sized screenings of trap rock and each bid was accepted by the Assistant State Procurement Officer on June 29, 1937. The four documents are substantially alike and it will suffice to describe one of them. It is a printed government form, with the blank spaces filled in in typewriting, consisting of a single sheet bearing the heading:</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">“Invitation, Bid, and Acceptance”</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">“(Short Form Contract)”</span></p>
<p class="indent">Below the heading, under the subheadings, follow in order the “Invitation,” the “Bid,” and the “Acceptance by the Government.” The Invitation, signed by a State Procurement Officer, states that “Sealed bids in triplicate, subject to the conditions on the reverse hereof, will be received at this office * * * for furnishing supplies * * * for delivery at WP 2752—Mollison Airport, Bridgeport, Ct.” Then come typed provisions which, so far as material, are as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Item No. 1. ½″ Trap Rock to pass the following screening test * * * approx. 4000 tons, unit price $2.00 amount $8000. To be delivered to project as required. Delivery to start immediately. Communicate with W.J. Scott, Supt. W.P.A. Branch Office, 147 Canon Street, Bridgeport, Ct., for definite delivery instructions. Cancellation by the Procurement Division may be effected at any time.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Bid, signed by the plaintiff, provides that</p>
<p class="blockquotes">In compliance with the above invitation for bids, and subject to all of the conditions thereof, the undersigned offers, and agrees, if this bid be accepted * * * to furnish any or all of the items upon which prices are quoted, at the prices set opposite each item, delivered at the point(s) as specified, * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">The Acceptance, besides its date and the signature of an Assistant State Procurement Officer, contains only the words “Accepted as to items numbered 1.” The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page38" class="pagebreak">38</span>printing on the reverse side of the sheet under the heading “Conditions” and “Instructions to Contracting Officers” clearly indicates that the parties supposed they were entering into an enforcible contract. For example, Condition 3 states that “in case of default of the contractor” the government may procure the articles from other sources and hold the contractor liable for any excess in cost; and Condition 4 provides that “if the contractor refuses or fails to make deliveries * * * within the time specified * * * the Government may by written notice terminate the right of the contractor to proceed with deliveries * * *.” The Instructions to Contracting Officers also presupposes the making of a valid contract; No. 2 reads:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Although this form meets the requirements of a formal contract (R.S. 3744), if the execution of a formal contract with bond is contemplated, U.S. Standard Forms 31 and 32 should be used.</p>
<p class="indent">No one can read the document as a whole without concluding that the parties intended a contract to result from the Bid and the Government’s Acceptance. If the United States did not so intend, it certainly set a skillful trap for unwary bidders. No such purpose should be attributed to the government. In construing the document the presumption should be indulged that both parties were acting in good faith.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the Acceptance contains no promissory words, it is conceded that a promise by the defendant to pay the stated price for rock delivered is to be implied. Since no precise time for delivery was specified, the implication is that delivery within a reasonable time was contemplated. This is corroborated by the express provision that the rock was “to be delivered to the project as required. Delivery to start immediately.” There is also to be implied a promise to give delivery instructions; nothing in the language of the contracts indicates that performance by the plaintiff was to be conditional upon the exercise of the defendant’s discretion in giving such instructions. A more reasonable interpretation is that the defendant was placed under an obligation to give instructions for delivery from time to time when trap rock was required at the project. Such were the duties of the defendant, unless the cancellation clause precludes such a construction of the document.</p>
<p class="indent">Beyond question the plaintiff made a promise to deliver rock at a stated price; and if the United States were suing for its breach the question would be whether the “acceptance” by the United States operated as a sufficient consideration to make the plaintiff’s promise binding. Since the United States is the defendant the question is whether it made any promise that has been broken. Its “acceptance” should be interpreted as a reasonable business man would have understood it. Surely it would not have been understood thus: “We accept your offer and bind you to your promise to deliver, but we do not promise either to take the rock or pay the price.” The reservation of a power to effect cancellation at any time meant something different from this. We believe that the reasonable interpretation of the document is as follows: “We accept your offer to deliver within a reasonable time, and we promise <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page39" class="pagebreak">39</span>to take the rock and pay the price unless we give you notice of cancellation within a reasonable time.” Only on such an interpretation is the United States justified in expecting the plaintiff to prepare for performance and to remain ready and willing to deliver. Even so, the bidder is taking a great risk and the United States has an advantage. It is not “good faith” for the United States to insist upon more than this. It is certain that the United States intended to bind the bidder to a “contract,” and that the bidder thought that the “acceptance” of his bid made a “contract.” A reasonable interpretation of the language used gives effect to their mutual intention. Consequently we cannot accept the contention that the defendant’s power of cancellation was unrestricted and could be exercised merely by failure to give delivery orders. The words “cancellation may be effected at any time” imply affirmative action, namely, the giving of notice of intent to cancel. The defendant itself so construed the clause by giving notice of cancellation on July 11, 1939, as alleged in its answer. While the phrase “at any time” should be liberally construed, it means much less than “forever.” If taken literally, it would mean that after the defendant had given instructions for delivery and the plaintiff had tendered delivery in accordance therewith, or even after delivery had actually been made, the defendant could refuse to accept and when sued for the price give notice of cancellation of the contract. Such an interpretation would be not only unjust and unreasonable, but would make nugatory the entire contract, contrary to the intention of the parties, if it be assumed that the United States was acting in good faith in accepting the plaintiff’s bid. The words should be so construed as to support the contract and not render illusory the promises of both parties. This can be accomplished by interpolating the word “reasonable,” as is often done with respect to indefinite time clauses. Hence the agreement obligated the defendant to give delivery instructions or notice of cancellation within a reasonable time after the date of its “acceptance.” This constituted consideration for the plaintiff’s promise to deliver in accordance with delivery instructions, and made the agreement a valid contract.</p>
<p class="indent">It must be conceded that the cases dealing with agreements in which one party has reserved to himself an option to cancel are not entirely harmonious. Where the option is completely unrestricted some courts say that the party having the option has promised nothing and the contract is void for lack of mutuality. These cases have been criticized by competent text writers and the latter case cited by this court “with distinct lack of warmth,” as Judge Clark noted in <span class="italic">Bushwick–Decatur Motors v. Ford Motor Co.</span> But where, as in the case at bar, the option to cancel “does not wholly defeat consideration,” the agreement is not <span class="italic">nudum pactum</span>. A promise is not made illusory by the fact that the promisor has an option between two alternatives, if each alternative would be sufficient consideration if it alone were bargained for. As we have construed the agreement the United States promised by implication to take and pay for the trap rock or give notice of cancellation within a reasonable time. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page40" class="pagebreak">40</span>alternative of giving notice was not difficult of performance, but it was a sufficient consideration to support the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for trial.</p>
<p id="sec15" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Does Judge Swan decide that there was an enforceable contract here?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The court interprets the cancellation clause to be restricted by an implied promise to give notice of cancellation within a reasonable time. Do you agree with the court that the implication of such a promise on the government’s part is the interpretation a reasonable businessperson would have made in this circumstance?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. If the government contract form read “cancellable without notice for any reason at any time—reasonable or not—within the next 20 years,” would a supplier like Sylvan Crest Sand as readily accept such an order? Would it think that it had made a contract if it did accept it? Would the result in <span class="italic">Sylvan Crest</span> have been the same if this had been the language requiring interpretation?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Was the United States bound because it had “promised by implication,” or had it “promised by implication” because it was bound?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. If the government abandoned construction of the airport and hence needed no rock (<span class="italic">i.e</span>., it didn’t buy rock from anyone else), would its failure to give Sylvan Crest notice be a breach? If the government’s power of cancellation were unrestricted, would there be any contract at all? Must the answers to these two questions be necessarily reconcilable?</p>

<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1917.</p>
<p class="sectionb">222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>ARDOZO</small>, J. The defendant styles herself “a creator of fashions.” Her favor helps a sale. Manufacturers of dresses, millinery, and like articles are glad to pay for a certificate of her approval. The things which she designs, fabrics, parasols, and what not, have a new value in the public mind when issued in her name. She employed the plaintiff to help her to turn this vogue into money. He was to have the exclusive right, subject always to her approval, to place her indorsements on the designs of others. He was also to have the exclusive right to place her own designs on sale, or to license others to market them. In return she was to have one-half of “all profits and revenues” derived from any contracts he might make. The exclusive right was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page41" class="pagebreak">41</span>to last at least one year from April 1, 1915, and thereafter from year to year unless terminated by notice of 90 days. The plaintiff says that he kept the contract on his part, and that the defendant broke it. She placed her indorsement on fabrics, dresses, and millinery without his knowledge, and withheld the profits. He sues her for the damages, and the case comes here on demurrer.</p>
<p class="indent">The agreement of employment is signed by both parties. It has a wealth of recitals. The defendant insists, however, that it lacks the elements of a contract. She says that the plaintiff does not bind himself to anything. It is true that he does not promise in so many words that he will use reasonable efforts to place the defendant’s indorsements and market her designs. We think, however, that such a promise is fairly to be implied. The law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was the sovereign talisman, and every slip was fatal. It takes a broader view today. A promise may be lacking, and yet the whole writing may be “instinct with an obligation,” imperfectly expressed (Scott, J., in <span class="italic">McCall Co. v. Wright</span>, 133 App.Div. 62). If that is so, there is a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The implication of a promise here finds support in many circumstances. The defendant gave an exclusive privilege. She was to have no right for at least a year to place her own indorsements or market her own designs except through the agency of the plaintiff. The acceptance of the exclusive agency was an assumption of its duties. Many other terms of the agreement point the same way. We are told at the outset by way of recital that:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">“The said Otis F. Wood possesses a business organization adapted to the placing of such indorsements as the said Lucy, Lady Duff–Gordon, has approved.”</p>
<p class="indent">The implication is that the plaintiff’s business organization will be used for the purpose for which it is adapted. But the terms of the defendant’s compensation are even more significant. Her sole compensation for the grant of an exclusive agency is to be one-half of all the profits resulting from the plaintiff’s efforts. Unless he gave his efforts, she could never get anything. Without an implied promise, the transaction cannot have such business “efficacy, as both parties must have intended that at all events it should have.” Bowen, L.J., in <span class="italic">The Moorcock</span>, 14 P.D. 64, 68. But the contract does not stop there. The plaintiff goes on to promise that he will account monthly for all moneys received by him, and that he will take out all such patents and copyrights and trademarks as may in his judgment be necessary to protect the rights and articles affected by the agreement. It is true, of course, as the Appellate Division has said, that if he was under no duty to try to market designs or to place certificates of indorsement, his promise to account for profits or take out copyrights would be valueless. But in determining the intention of the parties the promise has a value. It helps to enforce the conclusion that the plaintiff had some duties. His promise to pay the defendant one-half of the profits and revenues resulting from the exclusive agency and to render accounts monthly was a promise to use reasonable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page42" class="pagebreak">42</span>efforts to bring profits and revenues into existence. For this conclusion the authorities are ample.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the order of the Special Term affirmed, with costs in the Appellate Division and in this court.</p>
<p id="sec17" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The problem in this case is whether there was consideration to bind Lady Lucy to her promise. Is this a problem of interpretation?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Did Wood promise to make sales, did he promise to use reasonable efforts, or did he and Lady Lucy merely agree that so long as he used reasonable efforts his exclusive agency could not be taken away from him? Is the lack of an express promise here just a matter of imperfect expression, as Judge Cardozo suggests, or is the substance of the deal uncertain? Imagine that we interrupted Wood and Lady Lucy while negotiating this agency agreement and asked them what they thought. Do you think that each had a clear intention regarding Wood’s obligations at that time? Do you think that their intentions were identical? If not, was there a contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Reverse the parties in the case by supposing that Lady Lucy (having scrupulously kept the agreement on her part) sued Wood on the ground that he had not used reasonable efforts to market her “favor.” Would the court be as apt to find the implied promise by Wood that it found here? How could Lady Lucy prove that Wood’s efforts were less than reasonable and how much business she had lost because of Wood’s lack of diligence? What information would she need?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. There are thousands of “exclusive dealership” contracts made every year. How would you draft such an agreement so that you wouldn’t have to rely on a Cardozo to find a contract? What kind of information would you want from your client and from the other party? Remember that such a contract must be acceptable to both parties. See UCC § 2–306(2).</p>

<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>UKASEY</small>, D.J. Plaintiff B. Lewis Productions, Inc. (BLP) sues defendant Maya Angelou for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. For the reasons set forth below, [Angelou’s motion for summary judgment is] denied.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">…</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">B. Factual History</span></p>
<p class="indent">Butch Lewis is the president and sole owner of BLP. BLP’s business consists primarily of promoting boxing and other sports and entertainment events. Defendant Maya Angelou, a resident of North Carolina, is a renowned poet. Hallmark Cards, Incorporated, a Missouri corporation, manufactures greeting cards and related products. In this action, BLP claims that Angelou breached an agreement in which she granted BLP the exclusive right to exploit her original literary works for publication in greeting cards and similar products. Angelou claims that no enforceable contract existed.</p>
<p class="indent">Lewis and Angelou became acquainted in early 1994 when, at Lewis’s request, Angelou visited Mike Tyson at an Indiana prison. At that meeting, Angelou and Lewis discussed how she might reach a broader base of readers by publishing her works in greeting cards. Several months after this initial meeting, Lewis met with Angelou at her North Carolina home to discuss a potential collaboration between Angelou and BLP to market Angelou’s works to greeting card companies. In November 1994, Lewis and Angelou signed a “letter agreement” that established what the letter called a “Joint Venture” to publish Angelou’s writings in greeting cards and other media forms. The letter agreement, dated November 22, 1994 and signed by both parties, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_indl">This letter agreement made between B. LEWIS PRODUCTIONS, INC. (BLP) with offices at 250 West 57th Street, New York, N.Y. 10019 and MAYA ANGELOU (ANGELOU) whose address is 2720 Reynolda Road, Suite # 1, Winston-Salem, NC 27106, sets forth the understandings of the parties with reference to the following:</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">1. The parties will enter into a Joint Venture (Venture), wherein ANGELOU will exclusively contribute original literary works (Property) to the Venture and BLP will seek to exploit the rights for publishing of said Property in all media forms including, but not limited to greeting cards, stationery and calendars, etc.</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">2. BLP will contribute all the capital necessary to fund the operation of the Venture.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page44" class="pagebreak">44</div>
<p class="blockquote-nt">3. ANGELOU will contribute, on an exclusive basis, original literary works to the Venture after consultations with and mutual agreement of Butch Lewis, who will be the managing partner of the Venture.</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">4. The Venture shall own the copyrights to all of ANGELOU’s contributions to the Venture.</p>
<p class="blockquote_hang">(a) If any of the subject copyrights do not produce any income for a consecutive five (5) year period as a result of the exploitation referred to [in] paragraph 1 herein then the ownership of these copyrights shall revert to Angelou exclusively.</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">5. The name of the Venture shall be mutually agreed upon.</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">6. Gross Revenue shall be distributed and applied in the following order:</p>
<p class="blockquote_hang">(a) Return of BLP’s capital contribution.</p>
<p class="blockquote_hang">(b) Reimbursement of any and all expenses of the Venture.</p>
<p class="blockquote_hang">(c) Balance (net profits) to be shared equally between BLP and ANGELOU.</p>
<p class="blockquote_hang">(d) ANGELOU shall have the right at any time, upon reasonable notice, to inspect all records including but not limited to the financial records of the Venture.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties until a more formal detailed agreement is signed.</p>
<p class="indent">In late 1994, BLP began to market Angelou’s work to Hallmark and several other greeting card companies. Lewis began to negotiate a license agreement with Hallmark on Angelou’s behalf. When Hallmark asked Lewis for confirmation that he was indeed authorized to act on Angelou’s behalf, on June 19, 1996, Lewis sent Hallmark a letter signed by Angelou that stated:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">This will confirm that BUTCH LEWIS PRODUCTIONS, INC. (BLP) has the exclusive right to represent DR. MAYA ANGELOU for the exploitation of her work product in the area of greeting cards, stationery, calendars, etc. as per the contract executed by BLP and Dr. Angelou dated November 22, 1994 which is still in full force and effect.</p>
<p class="indent">BLP declined to send Hallmark the November 22, 1994 agreement itself because Lewis wanted to keep its terms confidential.</p>
<p class="indent">In March 1997, after extended negotiations, Hallmark sent BLP a license agreement for the use of Angelou’s future exclusive works which would have paid her and BLP 9% of gross revenues from sales of licensed products, with a $50,000 advance payment and a guaranteed minimum $100,000 in royalties. Angelou’s greeting cards would be administered through Hallmark’s Ethnic Business Center. Also in March 1997, Lewis and Angelou encountered one another at an event in Las Vegas, where Angelou saw Lewis, who is black, punctuate a conversation with white people by grabbing his crotch. After she witnessed Lewis’s behavior, Angelou “burned up his ears.” She claims that she told him that the “venture” between them was off, and that she no longer wanted to work with him. Lewis denies that Angelou made any such comment at the time.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page45" class="pagebreak">45</div>
<p class="indent">However, when Lewis forwarded the Hallmark license agreement to Angelou, she did not sign it, and later told her literary agent Helen Brann to “start putting a little cold water on the prospect of this deal with Hallmark.” After meeting with Lewis and his associate Joy Farrell, Brann sent a letter to Lewis on May 5, 1997, informing him “that it is not going to work out now for Dr. Maya Angelou to make any deal with Hallmark Cards.” In her letter, Brann cited Angelou’s commitment to Random House as the publisher of all of Angelou’s “major work” as a reason for not proceeding with Hallmark. Brann noted that “[n]either Dr. Angelou nor I like to say never, and I suppose that sometime in the future we might all figure out a way, in cooperation with Random House and Hallmark and us, to launch some kind of greeting card program, but this year is definitely not the year to contemplate such a move.”</p>
<p class="indent">Lewis claims that at a later meeting in 1997, Angelou told him that she would sign the licensing agreement with Hallmark “after the New Year,” and that in February 1998, she told him she was planning to sign the agreement “as soon as she [got] everything off her table.” However Angelou did not sign the Hallmark licensing agreement,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_1" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/12_chapter01.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> and according to Lewis’s associate Farrell, when Farrell left BLP in mid-1998, in her opinion the deal was “dead,” and the project was over. Additionally, because Hallmark did not hear from Lewis after it sent him the licensing agreement in 1997, Hallmark executives eventually concluded that the collaboration between BLP and Angelou was “dead.”</p>
<p class="indent">Hallmark wrote Angelou’s agent Brann in March 1998 to inquire whether Angelou was still interested in pursuing a program of greeting cards, stating that its “discussions with Mr. Lewis ended in early 1997 when he could not deliver a program.” Brann responded that Angelou was not interested in entering into an agreement with Hallmark at that time. However, in June 1999, Angelou’s close friend Amelia Parker, who was acquainted with an executive at Hallmark, convinced Angelou to have lunch with Hallmark executives at the company’s St. Louis headquarters when Angelou was in town for an unrelated speaking engagement. Angelou was encouraged by this meeting and decided to try to arrange a licensing deal with Hallmark.</p>
<p class="indent">Simultaneously, Angelou sought to assure that her ties to Lewis were severed. On June 16, 1999 Angelou’s North Carolina counsel sent a letter to BLP stating that “any business relationship that you may have had or contemplated pursuant to a letter dated November 22, 1994 from you to Dr. Angelou, has been terminated.” Lewis claims that he never received this letter, and that as far as he was concerned, the November 1994 letter agreement was still in force in 1999. According to Lewis, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page46" class="pagebreak">46</span>he contacted Angelou in 1999 about the Hallmark licensing agreement and she put him off again; at this point Lewis stopped trying to communicate with Angelou about Hallmark, and instead kept abreast of her views on the matter by communicating with her close friend Bob Brown, who did not tell Lewis that the “venture” had been terminated. Lewis learned that Hallmark and Angelou had reached an agreement without his assistance when he saw a press release about the deal in November 2000.</p>
<p class="indent">On June 28, 2000, after more than a year of negotiations and discussions, Hallmark and Angelou signed a licensing agreement which featured a sliding royalty scale based on net revenues, guaranteed Angelou a minimum payment of $2 million, and gave her a $1 million advance. This agreement allowed Hallmark to use Angelou’s previously published work as well as future works she would create for the project; additionally, the marketing of Angelou’s products would not be restricted to ethnic consumers.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II.</span></p>
<p class="indent">In her motion for summary judgment, Angelou claims that as a matter of law, no bilateral contract existed between her and BLP because the Agreement was vague, indefinite, and lacking in essential terms.</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">A. Definiteness and Essential Terms</span></p>

It is not even enough that they have actually agreed, if their expressions, when interpreted in the light of accompanying factors and circumstances, are not such that the court can determine what the terms of the agreement are.”).</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, an agreement cannot be enforced if it lacks essential terms, and if the court is unable to supply such missing terms in a reasonable fashion that is consistent with the parties’ intent. <span class="italic">Best Brands</span>; <span class="italic">see also</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 204 (1981) (“When the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.”).</p>
<p class="indent">A court may not “rewrite the contract and impose liabilities not bargained for.” <span class="italic">A/S Atlantica v. Moran Towing &amp; Transp. Co.</span> (2d Cir.1974). However, New York and North Carolina courts are reluctant to strike down contracts for indefiniteness. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page47" class="pagebreak">47</span>Courts are cautioned not to turn the requirements of definiteness and essential terms into a fetish, because</p>
<p class="blockquote">at some point virtually every agreement can be said to have a degree of indefiniteness, and if the doctrine is applied with a heavy hand it may defeat the reasonable expectations of the parties in entering into a contract. While there must be a manifestation of mutual assent to essential terms, parties also should be held to their promises and courts should not be pedantic or meticulous in interpreting contract expressions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Cobble Hill Nursing Home, Inc. v. Henry &amp; Warren Corp.</span> (N.Y.1989).</p>
<p class="indent">A term is essential if “it seriously affects the rights and obligations of the parties and there is a significant evidentiary dispute as to its content.” <span class="italic">Ginsberg Machine Co. v. J. &amp; H. Label Processing Corp.</span> (2d Cir.1965). Terms that may be considered essential in any agreement include the price to be paid, the work to be done, and the time of performance. See 1 Williston on Contracts § 4.18. When a court encounters indefinite terms, but finds that the parties did intend to form a contract, as the court found in its first decision in this case, the court then must attempt to “attach a sufficiently definite meaning to [the] bargain.” 1 Williston § 4.18. A court should be especially willing to do so if the plaintiff has fully or partly performed under the agreement “since the performance may either remove the uncertainty or militate in favor of recovery even if the uncertainty continues.” <span class="italic">Id.</span> (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 34)); <span class="italic">see also</span> 1 Corbin § 4.1 (“The fact that one [party], with the knowledge and approval of the other, has begun performance is nearly always evidence that [the parties] regard the contract as consummated and intend to be bound thereby.”).</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the court may not make a contract for the parties. However, because the parties in this case did intend a contract, the court is obligated to fill any gaps their Agreement contains, if it reasonably is able to do so. Voiding an agreement for lack of essential terms “is a step that courts should take only in rare and extreme circumstances.” <span class="italic">Shann v. Dunk</span> (2d Cir.1996).</p>
<p class="indent">Angelou claims that the Agreement in this case is unenforceable because it lacks multiple essential terms. She notes that the Agreement does not specify or describe: what “original literary works” she would be contributing to the project; whether these literary works would be new or chosen from her previously published works; the quantity of works Angelou was to produce; when she was to contribute these works; the duration of the Agreement; or the extent of BLP’s substantive or financial obligations under the Agreement. Further, Angelou argues that the Agreement’s designation of BLP’s right to exploit Angelou’s work in “all media forms” is overbroad and does not express the parties’ intent, because this provision would have affected Angelou’s agreement with her literary publisher Random <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page48" class="pagebreak">48</span>House. As explained below, these allegedly indefinite or missing terms are capable of reasonable interpretation.</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">1. Price</span></p>
<p class="indentn">The general rule is that price is “an essential ingredient” of every contract, and that a compensation clause is enforceable only if payment can be determined from the agreement without any “further expression by the parties.” Angelou notes that the Agreement does not state how much capital, if any, BLP was obligated to contribute to the project, and argues that this constitutes a failure to specify the essential term of price. The Agreement does state, however, that BLP will contribute “all the capital necessary.” The Agreement further specifies how gross revenue generated by the “Venture” was to be distributed: BLP’s capital is returned, any of the Venture’s expenses are reimbursed, and any net profits are shared equally between BLP and Angelou. There is at least a material question of fact as to whether this payment and distribution scheme was sufficiently definite. BLP was obligated under the Agreement to contribute “all” capital—an arrangement with a meaning that arguably is capable of enforcement. Moreover, the capital necessary to a “Venture” of the sort at issue here would be modest, if indeed any capital expenditures would have been necessary. Even expense items were likely to be limited to funds required to produce greeting card mock-ups, postage, and perhaps some travel.</p>
<p class="indent">If Angelou had signed the Hallmark license agreement that Lewis had negotiated on her behalf, and if revenue had been generated from Angelou’s line of greeting cards, the Agreement between BLP and Angelou would have provided clear guidelines for distribution of that revenue. A compensation clause need not specify dollar figures to be definite.</p>
<p class="indent">BLP’s part performance too shows that the parties had a meeting of the minds on the financial aspects of the Agreement. BLP paid all initial expenses as Lewis began to negotiate licensing deals with various greeting card companies, and Angelou raised no objection during that time.</p>
<p class="indent">The price terms of the Agreement are capable of reasonable interpretation, and therefore arguably are sufficiently definite for enforcement.</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">2. Duration</span></p>
<p class="indentn">Angelou claims also that the Agreement’s lack of a duration term renders it too vague for enforcement. Indeed, in his deposition, Lewis admitted that “[t]here was no time set” on the Agreement. The parties dispute whether the Agreement’s copyright provision contains an implicit duration term. However, the court need decide this issue because the Agreement’s lack of a duration term is not material.</p>
<p class="indent">Under both New York and North Carolina law, a duration clause is not necessary in a contract for services. If such a contract makes no provision for duration, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page49" class="pagebreak">49</span>the contract is presumed to be terminable at will. If the Agreement between Angelou and BLP is viewed not as a joint venture but as a simple bilateral contract, BLP was contracting for Angelou’s services as a writer and Angelou was contracting for BLP’s services as a marketer of her work; under this view, the Agreement is a contract for services that need not contain a provision for duration, and may be terminated at will.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_2" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/12_chapter01.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">3. Subject Matter</span></p>
<p class="indentn">Angelou argues that the Agreement insufficiently defined the works she would supply to the project and the form in which her works would be exploited. The Agreement provides that Angelou will “exclusively contribute original literary works (Property) to the Venture and BLP will seek to exploit the rights for publishing of said Property in all media forms including, but not limited to greeting cards, stationery and calendars, etc.” The Agreement adds that Angelou will contribute, “on an exclusive basis, original literary works to the Venture after consultations with and mutual agreement of Butch Lewis, who will be the managing partner of the Venture.”</p>
<p class="indent">BLP claims that the Agreement’s subject matter was sufficiently definite because the Agreement stated that the details of the work would be mutually agreed upon, and could not be finalized until a licensing agreement with a specific greeting card company had been reached. Angelou claims that this admission confirms her argument that the Agreement was merely an “agreement to agree,” and not a binding Agreement in and of itself. The parties understood that they were agreeing to work together to publish Angelou’s writings in greeting cards, and potentially in related media forms such as calendars and stationery. The details of the arrangement would become final as individual projects were undertaken. When the Agreement was signed, there was a meeting of the minds as to its subject matter, and given the expressed intent of the parties, the court reasonably would be able to supply missing details, if necessary. Any omitted details are not material.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, BLP partially performed under the Agreement when it procured from Hallmark at least a draft that proposed the licensing of Angelou’s writings for use in greeting cards and related products. Although Angelou did not enter into this deal, neither did she question the propriety of BLP’s discussions with Hallmark, or suggest that her obligations under the Agreement were too indefinite to validate those discussions. BLP’s part performance thus helps to resolve uncertainty about the Agreement’s subject matter—if there was any such uncertainty to begin with. <span class="italic">See</span> 1 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" class="pagebreak">50</span>Corbin § 4.1 (“[T]he argument that a particular agreement is too indefinite to constitute a contract frequently is an afterthought excuse for attacking an agreement that failed for reasons other than the indefiniteness.”). Although defined in broad strokes, the Agreement’s subject matter was not so indefinite as to constitute “rare and extreme” circumstances justifying invalidation of a binding contract intended by both parties.</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">B. Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</span></p>
<p class="indentn">The above discussion of missing essential terms intersects with the issue of whether the parties here owed one another an obligation of good faith and fair dealing. New York and North Carolina courts have held that every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, in which each party agrees not to injure the rights of the other to receive benefits under that agreement. In this case, BLP argues that each party’s duty of good faith and fair dealing served to supply any missing terms relating to their respective obligations under the Agreement, and that Angelou breached her implied covenant of good faith when she failed to contribute any works to the project. Angelou counters that this claim duplicates BLP’s breach of contract claim, and that the duty of good faith and fair dealing may not be used to force her into obligations she never intended to assume.</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">1. Duty of Good Faith and Missing Terms</span></p>
<p class="indentn">Then-Judge Cardozo’s opinion in <span class="italic">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff Gordon</span>, underpins the analysis here. In that case, the defendant Lady Duff Gordon, a self-styled “creator of fashions,” agreed with the plaintiff Otis Wood that he would have the exclusive right, subject to her approval, to sell her designs, to license others to market them, and to place her endorsement on the designs of others. As Cardozo phrased it, “[s]he employed the plaintiff to turn this vogue into money.” Under the agreement, Lady Duff Gordon was to receive one half of “all profits and revenues” derived from contracts made by the defendant involving her work. The defendant sued Lady Duff Gordon, claiming that she had placed her endorsement on various products without his knowledge and kept the profits for herself. Lady Duff Gordon claimed in response that the original agreement between herself and Wood was unenforceable and illusory because it failed to specify Wood’s obligation to sell and market her designs.</p>
<p class="indent">The facts here strongly resemble those in Cardozo’s classic. As in that case, we have here an artistic defendant, a 50-50 arrangement to market her creations, and an alleged behind-the-back breach, with Ms. Angelou cast as a Lady Duff Gordon for the modern age.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Wood</span>, the Court held that although the contract between the parties did not spell out each party’s obligations,</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page51" class="pagebreak">51</div>
<p class="blockquote">[t]he law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was the sovereign talisman, and every slip was fatal. It takes a broader view today. A promise may be lacking, and yet the whole writing may be instinct with an obligation, imperfectly expressed. If that is so, there is a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court found the implication of a binding promise between the parties from numerous aspects of the agreement. Lady Duff Gordon gave Wood the “exclusive” right to market her creations; she must have expected him to perform, because her business would have ceased to exist without him. Additionally, Lady Duff Gordon’s sole compensation was to be one-half of the profits: Therefore unless Wood made reasonable efforts under the agreement, she could recover nothing under its terms, defeating the “business efficacy” that both parties must have desired when they made the agreement. The contract between Wood and Lady Duff Gordon was upheld, and generated a body of law in which the duty of good faith upheld binding agreements with scant details. 2 Corbin § 5.27 (“The finding of implied promises is more common today than in the era before the <span class="italic">Wood</span> case. Courts recognize that if the parties intend a contract, rather than a nullity, implying promises to avoid the finding of illusoriness or indefiniteness protects the reasonable expectation of the parties engendered by the agreement.”).</p>
<p class="indent">Angelou claims that the Agreement is unenforceable because it fails to define either party’s obligations. She argues that the Agreement does not specify a quantity of work to be supplied by her, nor does it state what effort BLP was required to expend in furtherance of the Agreement. According to Angelou, the Agreement was so vague that she could have complied with its terms and never provided any work to the project; similarly, BLP could have complied simply by making a few telephone inquiries. Indeed, both Lewis and Angelou testified that Angelou was under no obligation to provide any works to the project. Perhaps, but consider what might have occurred if Angelou had accepted some version of the proposal that Hallmark made to BLP. If Angelou had failed thereafter to contribute some works, but had published other works on her own that could have been used in greeting cards, BLP might have sued for damages stemming from Angelou’s nonperformance.</p>
<p class="indent">As was the case in <span class="italic">Wood</span>, it appears that the parties here intended to form a binding contract. Deficiencies or gaps in the Agreement regarding the parties’ obligations may be filled by the obligation of good faith that each incurred upon signing it. As in <span class="italic">Wood</span>, the profit-sharing arrangement between the parties here meant that Angelou and BLP had nothing to gain from the Agreement if either failed to perform or gave minimal effort. Therefore we must assume that each party arguably had an obligation to make “reasonable efforts” in furtherance of the Agreement in order to vindicate the “business efficacy” that both parties must have contemplated when they entered the Agreement.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page52" class="pagebreak">52</div>
<p class="indent">Angelou cites <span class="italic">Ginsberg</span> for the proposition that some contractual voids are too great to fill by implication. In <span class="italic">Ginsberg</span>, an oral contract followed by an exchange of letters between two businessmen for an exclusive agency in the selling of machine labels was found unenforceable for lack of any duration term in the agreement and other important omissions. The <span class="italic">Ginsberg</span> Court acknowledged <span class="italic">Wood</span>’s “classic principle,” but found too many terms missing, and held that “the risk of ensnaring a party in a set of contractual obligations that he never knowingly assumed [wa]s too serious.”</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, the evidence shows that Lewis and Angelou agreed on the terms of the contract and on the meaning of those terms. Angelou and BLP never argued over the substance of the Agreement, and as Lewis marketed the Angelou project to greeting card companies, Angelou never protested. To the contrary, she signed a confirmation of the Agreement on June 19, 1996, which was sent to Hallmark. Angelou did eventually refuse to deal with BLP, but this decision was not motivated by any contractual dispute. Angelou testified that she did not like the mock-ups of the greeting cards that BLP presented to her, that she was disgusted by Lewis’s behavior at the event in Las Vegas, and that she felt it was morally wrong to compromise her relationship with Random House by publishing her work elsewhere. None of these reservations had anything to do with the terms of the contract Angelou signed with BLP. Angelou articulated no concerns about the nature or scope of the Agreement, and did not complain that she had been ensnared into contractual obligations she had unknowingly assumed. Angelou’s plight does not resemble that of the merchant in <span class="italic">Ginsberg</span> who made an oral contract and signed an informal letter confirming a vague arrangement. Her case more closely parallels that of Lady Duff Gordon, who signed a binding agreement that she later came to regret.</p>
<p class="indent">The repeated use of the language of exclusivity in the dealings between Angelou and BLP is further evidence that each party had a good faith obligation to perform under the Agreement. The Agreement twice uses the word “exclusive” in describing Angelou’s contributions to the “Venture”—“Angelou will exclusively contribute original literary works,” and “Angelou will contribute, on an exclusive basis, original literary works”—and in the letter sent by Angelou and BLP to Hallmark on June 19, 1996, Angelou stated that BLP had the “exclusive right” to represent her “for the exploitation of her work product in the area of greeting cards, stationery, calendars, etc.” This court held previously that the parties did not contemplate an exclusive agency in their Agreement—instead, they set out to form a joint venture, but did so improperly. Lewis denied repeatedly that he was Angelou’s exclusive agent, and instead insisted that the two were “partners.” But even if the arrangement Angelou and Lewis entered into could not be described as an agency, the Agreement and the June 19, 1996 confirmation letter both show that the parties <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page53" class="pagebreak">53</span>intended to work with one another on the greeting card project, and Angelou promised that she would provide her work for use in greeting cards exclusively to BLP. This language is further evidence that the parties assumed that each would act in good faith to further the Agreement. As in <span class="italic">Wood</span>, “[w]e are not to suppose that one party was to be placed at the mercy of the other”; rather, Angelou committed to work only with BLP to accomplish her contractual goal, and trusted that BLP would fulfill his obligations under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed above, and bearing in mind that the court must construe all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Agreement at least arguably contains most if not all required essential terms for enforcement. Any remaining vagueness or uncertainty regarding the parties’ obligations may be found immaterial, because the parties’ reciprocal duty of good faith under the Agreement ensured that they would make reasonable efforts to perform.</p>
<p id="sec19" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTES AND QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Dr. Maya Angelou (1928-2014) was a highly regarded literary figure and civil rights activist. Her major works include her first novel, <span class="italic">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</span> (1970). She wrote and delivered her poem <span class="italic">On the Pulse of The Morning</span> at President Bill Clinton’s first inauguration. Butch Lewis (1946-2011) managed and promoted prominent boxers including Leon and Michael Spinks. Judge Michael Mukasey went on to become Attorney General of the United States under President George W. Bush.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Do you agree that Dr. Angelou and Lady Lucy are similarly situated here? Who do you think has the stronger claim for enforcement Wood or BLP? If you were to distinguish the two cases on what basis would you do so representing Dr. Angelou? How about if you were representing BLP?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The subsequent settlement of this lawsuit gave rise to further litigation between these parties. Lewis eventually settled for a lump sum payment of $456,019 plus 1.25% of future net revenues from Hallmark. In <span class="italic">B. Lewis Prods. v. Angelou</span>, 2008 U.S. Dist. WL1826486 (S.D.N.Y Apr. 22, 2008), the court dismissed BLP’s complaint that it had been defrauded in the settlement negotiations. Under the terms of the settlement, BLP accepted future royalties from Hallmark in satisfaction of its claim against Angelou, but Angelou had already accepted (but failed to disclose) an advance from Hallmark that had the effect of reducing future royalties payable to BLP. Concluding that BLP is “a sophisticated player who was on notice of the existence of the [agreement between Hallmark and Angelou] and its impact on Angelou’s past and future payments from Hallmark,” the court held that BLP’s reliance on Angelou’s silence was not reasonable: Angelou could keep her undisclosed advance, and BLP’s royalties under the settlement would be accordingly reduced.</p>

<p class="indent">Action by Holderman against Keller upon a check for $300 drawn by Keller upon a banker at Niles, and not honored. The cause was tried without a jury, and the Circuit Judge found as facts, that the check was given for an old silver watch, worth about $15, which Keller took and kept till the day of trial, when he offered to return it to the plaintiff, who refused to receive it. The whole transaction was a frolic and banter—the plaintiff not expecting to sell, nor the defendant intending to buy the watch at the sum for which the check was drawn. The defendant when he drew <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page55" class="pagebreak">55</span>the check had no money in the banker’s hands, and had intended to insert a condition in the check that would prevent his being liable upon it; but as he had failed to do so, and had retained the watch, the Judge held him liable, and judgment was rendered against him for the amount of the check.</p>

<p id="sec24" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Brown v. Finney</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Pennsylvania Supreme Court, 1866.</p>
<p class="sectionb">53 Pa. 373.</p>
<p class="indent">[Robert Finney brought an action of assumpsit against William Brown in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for breach of a contract for the delivery in Cincinnati of 100,000 bushels of coal. Trial was before a jury, which delivered a verdict of $2000 for the plaintiff, Finney. The defendant, Brown, appealed to this court, claiming that the trial judge misled the jury in his instructions on the law that the jury was to apply to the case.]</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ T<small>HOMPSON</small>, J. The testimony shows that the plaintiff and defendant accidentally met at a restaurant or refreshment saloon, not on business, but accidentally, to procure refreshment. Several others were present, and the defendant being an extensive coal dealer, the conversation turned to the price of coal, and eventually the price at which it could be delivered per bushel at Cincinnati. The defendant alleged he could deliver it there at the price it was selling at Pittsburgh, at sixteen cents per bushel. The plaintiff,—the witness McKee thought,—bantered him about delivering coal there to him at that price, but the defendant said he could and would. Finney said he would take 100,000 bushels, and called for pen, ink and paper to write a contract. Brown said the barges to be used in transporting the coal were to be returned in good order, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and he must have $10 a day for each after a proper time had elapsed for the plaintiff to unload and return them. He further said the coal must be [paid for in] cash. The plaintiff said, “Certainly,” and commenced writing a check, one of the plaintiff’s party handing him a stamp. Brown then remarked, “Never mind that, I’ll have the papers drawn up tomorrow.” The matter proceeded no further then, but on the next day or next but one, the plaintiff with one or two of those who were of his party at the saloon, called on the defendant to consummate the writings, but disputes arising, the contract was never put in writing, and the plaintiff not long thereafter sued on the contract as complete at the first interview, and recovered $2000 damages.</p>
<p class="indent">… “Either party,” said the learned judge [in his instructions to the jury], “in making a contract, can make it conditional or dependent on being reduced to writing before becoming binding upon him, so that he may see its terms in a definite shape; but this must be a condition or one of the conditions of the contract itself or reservation on his part on entering into it.” Here … a complete contract [is] assumed, and the necessity for a reservation or condition to prevent it being binding as a contract. This assumes the question at issue by requiring reservations and conditions to prevent the contract going into effect, which without them would be complete. But this would not be necessary where the terms of the contract were not all agreed upon. Such reservations or conditions would be out of place then. Whether a contract had been completed in the case in hand was the essential question of the case, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page57" class="pagebreak">57</span>and when instructions were given based upon an assumed complete contract the jury were, doubtless, misled. It needs no reservations or provisoes in a case where all the essential terms are not agreed upon but postponed to another time, for the assent of the contracting minds is wanting…. The transaction looks like what McKee thought it was, a bantering proposition by the plaintiff to the defendant, and wanting the intention to contract. There was certainly testimony on this point—the time, place and circumstances tended to show it, and it should have been clearly put to the jury to say whether, under the testimony, there was a contract or not. It is not every loose conversation that is to be turned into a contract, although the parties may seem to agree. A man is not to be snapped up for an unintended proposition made when he has no reason to suppose anybody wants to accept what he proposes. When people meet to do business they are presumed to mean what they propose, and expect to be taken up; but a proposition made and accepted where no expectation of contracting exists, should be carefully weighed with all the circumstances when the question of assent at the time comes to be questioned, as here. We do not intend to intimate any opinion on the merits of this controversy, but for the reasons given we think it ought to go to another jury. We see nothing else in the case which calls for notice or correction.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment reversed, and a <span class="italic">venire de novo</span> awarded.</p>
<p id="sec25" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The issue on appeal in this case is the correctness of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury. The jury trial system divides the function of the jury to decide questions of fact from the function of the judge to decide matters of law. After the testimony of witnesses and other proof has been presented to the jury, the trial judge frames the factual issues by instructing the jury on the relevant issues of law. The jury is expected to decide the ultimate issues of liability in conformity with the judge’s instructions, but there is little direct review of the jury’s findings. While the jury is supposed to follow the law, it is left a lot of room in practice to reach what it thinks is a just and sensible result.</p>
<p class="indent">Jury instructions also describe a division of function between the trial court and the reviewing appellate court. Trial judges generally accept the jury’s findings as binding within broad limits. A trial judge may order judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) only if the judge believes that no reasonable jury could have found as it did consistent with the legal instructions given. A trial judge, however, may without giving judgment for one party or the other order a new trial in the interests of justice if he believes that the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence. Appellate courts are even less free to second guess jury factfinding. The judge’s instructions are freely reviewable on appeal as questions of law, but the appellate court <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page58" class="pagebreak">58</span>should not reverse on the facts, unless no substantial evidence supports the jury’s verdict. Nonetheless, the reviewing court may reach quite far to find a legal error in the instructions and reverse a questionable result on this ground.</p>

As the contest progressed, Blair allegedly told the waitresses that he did not know whether the winner would receive a Toyota car, truck, or van, but that she would have to pay any registration fees on the vehicle. In early May, Blair informed Berry that she had won the contest. He proceeded to blindfold her and lead her to the restaurant’s parking lot.

<p class="indent">One vital aspect of the arrangement between Best and Southland was: What did the parties intend and what reasonable expectations might have been created by the language they used?

Or was the promise merely to lend the plywood, so long as it was just inventory for which Southland itself had no pressing immediate need?</p>
<p class="indent">Questions like this go to the heart of this and most contract problems. It is often difficult to determine what risks have been assumed by each of the parties when they made the deal. The question is begged by the proposition that it is the intent of the parties when they made the contract that governs. Of course, people are free to make agreements, and the law will lend its power to enforce the obligations people voluntarily assume by their contracts. But how do judges determine that intent?</p>
<p class="indent">At the outset the interpreter must deal with variations in what is meant by “intent” and “agreement.” At one end of the spectrum is the view that an agreement is a shared mental state by two parties. The interpretive search is for indications of the psychological, internal, subjective state of mind that they shared. At the other extreme is the view that an agreement has little to do with the subjective state of mind of the parties. An agreement is an objective, external, observable reality. This perspective emphasizes the extent to which the contract is not only the concern of the parties, but also will be importantly relied on by third parties who will act, change their relations, and expend wealth on the basis of it. Consider the banker approached to lend money to one of the parties to finance performance of the contract. The banker needs to assess the risks and potential costs of the agreement and determine what it means objectively. The banker can’t practically inquire into what the parties had in mind; she needs to interpret the contract on the basis of its objective content. In the real world both perspectives will make a claim on the interpreter. It is because the contract reflects the parties’ subjective intention that the agreement is considered worthy of the law’s enforcing attention. At the same time, the needs of commerce demand that contracts consist of objective and ascertainable behavior that a third person can observe, place in context, and depend upon. In practice, the law sometimes gives prominence to an objective theory of contracts, and at other times it applies a more subjective approach. Often courts and legislatures blend both perspectives and leave it to the interpreter to work the conflict out in a particular case.</p>
<p class="indent">For Justice Holmes and a great many other lawyers, the potential discontinuity between a judge’s interpretation and the parties’ subjective intent is not only inevitable but appropriate:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I do not suppose that you could prove, for purposes of construction as distinguished from avoidance, an oral declaration or even an agreement that words in a dispositive instrument making sense as they stand should have a different <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page60" class="pagebreak">60</span>meaning from the common one: for instance, that the parties to a contract orally agreed that when they wrote five hundred feet it should mean one hundred inches, or that Bunker Hill Monument should signify Old South Church. On the other hand, when you have the security of a local or class custom or habit of speech, it may be presumed that the writer conforms to the usage of his place or class when that is what a normal person in his situation would do….</p>

<p class="indent">The policy of stern refusal to consider subjective intention, prevalent in the centralized common law courts of that period, later gave way; in the latter part of the 18th and the early part of the 19th century, the recession from that policy went far, and there was much talk of the “meeting of the minds” in the formation of contracts, of giving effect to the actual “will” of the contracting parties. The obstacles to learning that actual intention have, more recently, induced a partial reversion to the older view. Today a court generally restricts its attention to the outward behavior of the parties: the meaning of their acts is not what either party or both parties intended but the meaning which a “reasonable man” puts on those acts; the expression of mutual assent, not the assent itself, is usually the essential element. We now speak of “externality,” insisting on judicial consideration of only those manifestations of intention which are public (“open to the scrutiny and knowledge of the community”) and not private (“secreted in the heart” of a person). This objective approach is of great value, for a legal system can be more effectively administered if legal rights and obligations ordinarily attach only to overt conduct….</p>
<p class="indent">But we should not demand too much of this concept of “objectivity”; like all useful concepts it becomes a thought-muddler if its limitations are disregarded. We can largely rid ourselves of concern with the subjective reactions of the parties; when, however, we test their public behavior by inquiring how it appears to the “reasonable man,” we must recognize, unless we wish to fool ourselves, that although one area of subjectivity has been conquered, another remains unsubdued…. We say that “the objective viewpoint of a third person is used.” But where do we find that “objective” third person? We ask judges or juries to discover that “objective viewpoint”—through their own subjective processes. Being but human, their beliefs cannot be objectified, in the sense of being standardized. Doubtless, there is some moderate approximation to objectivity, that is, to uniformity of beliefs, among judges—men with substantially similar training—although less than is sometimes supposed. But no one can seriously maintain that such uniformity exists among the multitude of jurymen, men with the greatest conceivable variety of training and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page61" class="pagebreak">61</span>background. When juries try cases, objectivity is largely a mirage; most of the objectivity inheres in the words of the “reasonable man” standard which the judges, often futilely, admonish juries to apply to the evidence. Certain aspects of subjectivity common to all men seem to have been successfully eliminated in the field of science through the “relativity theory”—which might better be called the “anti-relativity” or “absolute” theory. But equal success has not attended the anti-relativity or objective theory in the legal field. Perhaps nine-tenths of legal uncertainty is caused by uncertainty as to what courts will find, on conflicting evidence, to be the facts of cases.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Once a basic interpretive stance is established, several other levels of difficulty immediately become apparent.</p>
<h4 id="sec28" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">A.    W<small>ORDS ARE</small> A<small>MBIGUOUS</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent-t">The ambiguity of words, their capacity to express different meanings and their way of taking on differing shades of meaning all constrain a party’s (and his lawyer’s) capacity to express intentions and expectations unambiguously. Words are slippery tools and are often subject to more than one meaning. It is almost always possible to find an obscurity or ambiguity in the meaning of the most common phrases. Sometimes the variant meanings will seem farfetched, and the suggestion that a phrase has a surprising meaning sounds like a lawyer’s pettifogging game designed to let a party slip out of his obligation. But, often there is genuine uncertainty about how to best resolve ambiguities in an agreement. The uncertainty is likely to be particularly acute when an agreement consists of an informal conversation or letters between the parties rather than formal writings drafted by their lawyers. Businesspeople do not negotiate each word as diplomats drafting a treaty. Many contracts outline the deal in rather general terms and do not bother to state the assumptions “everybody knows” or provide a dictionary defining each term used.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries may purport to assign and describe the precise meaning of words, but usage often varies from dictionary definitions. Some such deviations may be peculiar to an individual; others reflect group, trade, or community usage not found in standard dictionaries. Moreover dictionaries do not insist that there is a single correct meaning for each word. Justice Holmes poetically described the relationship between words and meanings in <span class="italic">Towne v. Eisner</span>, 245 U.S. 418, 425 (1918), in concluding that “income” in a revenue act did not necessarily mean the same as “income” in the Sixteenth Amendment: “A word is not a crystal, transparent and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page62" class="pagebreak">62</span>unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.”</p>
<p class="indent">Interpretation may be difficult, but courts are not without resources. The obvious first place to look for meaning is to the words of the contract itself. Some potential meanings will seem obvious, and it is easier to persuade a judge or jury that the contract means what it says, or, conversely, that a far-fetched or silly meaning is not likely to be the correct or attractive one. Nonetheless, there is plenty of room for variant interpretations.</p>
<p class="indent">When the words used seem plain, there is an understandable inclination to apply the plain meaning and foreclose lawyers’ games designed to persuade that up means down. But words do not generally have a “plain meaning” divorced from the context and circumstances in which they are used. Hence, UCC § 1–201(11) defines contract as “the total legal obligation which results from the parties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.” And UCC § 1–201(3) defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by the implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance….”</p>
<p class="indent">Not only are words slippery tools at best, but people (even lawyers) often fail to spell out what to them is “obvious.” No matter how long and complex a writing may be, therefore, it inevitably is drafted against a background of unexpressed assumptions by the parties as to what they are doing, what its words mean, and what its consequences might be in the numberless contingencies that might occur.</p>
<p class="indent">To identify these special or unstated terms in any given agreement, one must look at its language in the context of the community and the trade within which it was made. What do words like these, actions like these, agreements of this sort connote in <span class="italic">this</span> community, within <span class="italic">this</span> business, to persons situated as <span class="italic">these</span> persons were?</p>
<p class="indent">The importance of linguistic context is already familiar to you from your daily life. It will be brought home to you when you take breaks from law school and try to explain to friends and relatives around the family dinner table what you have been doing this year. You are learning a new language and are beginning to give familiar words some very special meanings. The contagion of legal rhetoric will enable you to speak so that no non-lawyer will be able to grasp what you are saying. After you graduate from law school, people will hire you to deal with documents and transactions in which ordinary people are confounded by lawyers’ talk. By nurturing its own unique modes of expression the profession creates a market for its services. Outsiders have to hire us to understand what is going on.</p>
<p class="indent">Linguistic particularity is presented in starkest form in communications between persons from two countries where different languages are spoken. Around <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page63" class="pagebreak">63</span>the world, and to a growing extent, business crosses national borders. How does one interpret the meaning of communications between persons who speak different languages, especially when neither of them is speaking in his native tongue? The case that follows illustrates the possibilities. It involves a sales agent in New York, who apparently speaks German as well as English, selling chickens to a Swiss corporation acting as an agent for the former Czechoslovak government. The negotiations occurred in conversations in New York, transatlantic cables, and telephone calls that apparently were in both English and German. Viewed in terms of the subjective intent of the parties, it is very hard to determine what they had in mind in using the word “chicken.” Viewed objectively, the interpretive issues are even more puzzling, for it is clear that there are many communities involved in this transaction, and the meaning attached to “chicken” differs in different communities. How does a judge searching for a single viewpoint from which to decide the case choose among the possibilities? Are we searching for the objective meaning of the word as used by chicken sellers in New York, New Jersey, and Chicago, European chicken wholesalers, chicken regulators in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or cheeky, Czech, chicken chewers from Cheb?</p>

<p class="sectionb">190 F.Supp. 116.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ F<small>RIENDLY</small>, J. The issue is, what is chicken? Plaintiff says “chicken” means a young chicken, suitable for broiling and frying. Defendant says “chicken” means any bird of that genus that meets contract specifications on weight and quality, including what it calls “stewing chicken” and plaintiff pejoratively terms “fowl.” Dictionaries give both meanings, as well as some others not relevant here. To support its [definition], plaintiff sends a number of volleys over the net; defendant essays to return them and adds a few serves of its own. Assuming that both parties were acting in good faith, the case nicely illustrates Holmes’ remark “that the making of a contract depends not on the agreement of two minds in one intention, but on the agreement of two sets of external signs—not on the parties’ having <span class="italic">meant</span> the same thing but on their having <span class="italic">said</span> the same thing.” <span class="italic">The Path of the Law</span>. I have concluded that plaintiff has not sustained its burden of persuasion that the contract used “chicken” in the narrower sense.</p>
<p class="indent">The action is for breach of the warranty that goods sold shall correspond to the description. Two contracts are in suit. In the first, dated May 2, 1957, defendant, a New York sales corporation, confirmed the sale to plaintiff, a Swiss corporation, of</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page64" class="pagebreak">64</div>
<p class="blockquotes">“US Fresh Frozen Chicken, Grade A, Government Inspected, Eviscerated 2½–3 lbs. and 1½–2 lbs. each all chicken individually wrapped in cryovac, packed in secured fiber cartons or wooden boxes, suitable for export</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">75,000 lbs. 2½–3 lbs. <span style="padding-left:10pt;" />@$33.00</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">25,000 lbs. 1½–2 lbs. <span style="padding-left:10pt;" />@$36.50</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">per 100 lbs. FAS New York</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">scheduled May 10, 1957 pursuant to instructions from Penson &amp; Co., New York.”</p>
<p class="indent">The second contract, also dated May 2, 1957, was identical save that only 50,000 lbs. of the heavier “chicken” were called for, the price of the smaller birds was $37 per 100 lbs., and shipment was scheduled for May 30. The initial shipment under the first contract was short but the balance was shipped on May 17. When the initial shipment arrived in Switzerland, plaintiff found, on May 28, that the 2½–3 lbs. birds were not young chicken suitable for broiling and frying but stewing chicken or “fowl”; indeed, many of the cartons and bags plainly so indicated. Protests ensued. Nevertheless, shipment under the second contract was made on May 29, the 2½–3 lbs. birds again being stewing chicken. Defendant stopped the transportation of these at Rotterdam.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the word “chicken” standing alone is ambiguous, I turn first to see whether the contract itself offers any aid to its interpretation. Plaintiff says the 1½–2 lbs. birds necessarily had to be young chicken since the old birds do not come in that size, hence the 2½–3 lbs. birds must likewise be young. This is unpersuasive—a contract for “apples” of two different sizes could be filled with different kinds of apples even though only one species came in both sizes. Defendant notes that the contract called not simply for chicken but for “US Fresh Frozen Chicken, Grade A, Government Inspected.” It says the contract thereby incorporated by reference the Department of Agriculture’s regulations, which favor its interpretation; I shall return to this after reviewing plaintiff’s other contentions.</p>
<p class="indent">The first hinges on an exchange of cablegrams which preceded execution of the formal contracts. The negotiations leading up to the contracts were conducted in New York between defendant’s secretary, Ernest R. Bauer, and a Mr. Stovicek, who was in New York for the Czechoslovak government at the World Trade Fair. A few days after meeting Bauer at the fair, Stovicek telephoned and inquired whether defendant would be interested in exporting poultry to Switzerland. Bauer then met with Stovicek, who showed him a cable from plaintiff dated April 26, 1957, announcing that they “are buyer” of 25,000 lbs. of chicken 2½–3 lbs. weight, Cryovac packed, grade A Government inspected, at a price up to 33¢ per pound, for shipment on May 10, to be confirmed by the following morning, and were interested in further offerings. After testing the market for price, Bauer accepted, and Stovicek sent a confirmation that evening. Plaintiff stresses that, although these and subsequent cables between plaintiff and defendant, which laid the basis for the additional <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page65" class="pagebreak">65</span>quantities under the first and for all of the second contract, were predominantly in German, they used the English word “chicken”; it claims this was done because it understood “chicken” meant young chicken whereas the German word, “Huhn,” included both “Brathuhn” (broilers) and “Suppenhuhn” (stewing chicken), and that defendant, whose officers were thoroughly conversant with German, should have realized this. Whatever force this argument might otherwise have is largely drained away by Bauer’s testimony that he asked Stovicek what kind of chickens were wanted, received the answer “any kind of chickens,” and then, in German, asked whether the cable meant “Huhn” and received an affirmative response. Plaintiff attacks this as contrary to what Bauer testified on his deposition in March, 1959, and also on the ground that Stovicek had no authority to interpret the meaning of the cable. The first contention would be persuasive if sustained by the record, since Bauer was free at the trial from the threat of contradiction by Stovicek as he was not at the time of the deposition; however, review of the deposition does not convince me of the claimed inconsistency. As to the second contention, it may well be that Stovicek lacked authority to commit plaintiff for prices or delivery dates other than those specified in the cable; but plaintiff cannot at the same time rely on its cable to Stovicek as its dictionary to the meaning of the contract and repudiate the interpretation given the dictionary by the man in whose hands it was put. Plaintiff’s reliance on the fact that the contract forms contain the words “through the intermediary of:”, with the blank not filled as negating agency, is wholly unpersuasive; the purpose of this clause was to permit filling in the name of an intermediary to whom a commission would be payable, not to blot out what had been the fact.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff’s next contention is that there was a definite trade usage that “chicken” meant “young chicken.” Defendant showed that it was only beginning in the poultry trade in 1957, thereby bringing itself within the principle that “when one of the parties is not a member of the trade or other circle, his acceptance of the standard must be made to appear” by proving either that he had actual knowledge of the usage or that the usage is “so generally known in the community that his actual individual knowledge of it may be inferred.” Here there was no proof of actual knowledge of the alleged usage; indeed, it is quite plain that defendant’s belief was to the contrary. In order to meet the alternative requirement, the law of New York demands a showing that “the usage is of so long continuance, so well established, so notorious, so universal and so reasonable in itself, as that the presumption is violent that the parties contracted with reference to it, and made it a part of their agreement.” <span class="italic">Walls v. Bailey</span> (N.Y.1872).</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff endeavored to establish such a usage by the testimony of three witnesses and certain other evidence. Strasser, resident buyer in New York for a large chain of Swiss cooperatives, testified that “on chicken I would definitely understand a broiler.” However, the force of this testimony was considerably weakened by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page66" class="pagebreak">66</span>fact that in his own transactions the witness, a careful businessman, protected himself by using “broiler” when that was what he wanted and “fowl” when he wished older birds. Indeed, there are some indications, dating back to a remark of Lord Mansfield, <span class="italic">Edie v. East India Co.</span>, 2 Burr. 1216, 1222 (1761), that no credit should be given “witnesses to usage, who could not adduce instances in verification.” 7 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 1954. While Wigmore thinks this goes too far, a witness’ consistent failure to rely on the alleged usage deprives his opinion testimony of much of its effect. Niesielowski, an officer of one of the companies that had furnished the stewing chicken to defendant, testified that “chicken” meant “the male species of the poultry industry. That could be a broiler, a fryer or a roaster,” but not a stewing chicken; however, he also testified that upon receiving defendant’s inquiry for “chickens,” he asked whether the desire was for “fowl or frying chickens” and, in fact, supplied fowl, although taking the precaution of asking defendant, a day or two after plaintiff’s acceptance of the contracts in suit, to change its confirmation of its order from “chickens,” as defendant had originally prepared it, to “stewing chickens.” Dates, an employee of Urner–Barry Company, which publishes a daily market report on the poultry trade, gave it as his view that the trade meaning of “chicken” was “broilers and fryers.” In addition to this opinion testimony, plaintiff relied on the fact that the Urner–Barry service, the Journal of Commerce, and Weinberg Bros. &amp; Co. of Chicago, a large supplier of poultry, published quotations in a manner which, in one way or another, distinguish between “chicken,” comprising broilers, fryers and certain other categories, and “fowl,” which, Bauer acknowledged, included stewing chickens. This material would be impressive if there were nothing to the contrary. However, there was, as will now be seen.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s witness Weininger, who operates a chicken eviscerating plant in New Jersey, testified “Chicken is everything except a goose, a duck, and a turkey. Everything is a chicken, but then you have to say, you have to specify which category you want or that you are talking about.” Its witness Fox said that in the trade “chicken” would encompass all the various classifications. Sadina, who conducts a food inspection service, testified that he would consider any bird coming within the classes of “chicken” in the Department of Agriculture’s regulations to be a chicken. The specifications approved by the General Services Administration include fowl as well as broilers and fryers under the classification “chickens.” Statistics of the Institute of American Poultry Industries use the phrases “Young chickens” and “Mature chickens,” under the general heading “Total chickens.” and the Department of Agriculture’s daily and weekly price reports avoid use of the word “chicken” without specification.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page67" class="pagebreak">67</div>
<p class="indent">Defendant advances several other points which it claims affirmatively support its construction. Primary among these is the regulation of the Department of Agriculture, 7 C.F.R. §§ 70.300–70.370, entitled, “Grading and Inspection of Poultry and Edible Products Thereof.” and in particular § 70.301 which recited:</p>
<p class="indent">Chickens. The following are the various classes of chickens:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) Broiler or fryer * * *</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Roaster * * *</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Capon * * *</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Stag * * *</p>
<p class="indent">(e) Hen or stewing chicken or fowl * * *</p>
<p class="indent">(f) Cock or old rooster * * *</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant argues, as previously noted, that the contract incorporated these regulations by reference. Plaintiff answers that the contract provision related simply to grade and Government inspection and did not incorporate the Government definition of “chicken,” and also that the definition in the Regulations is ignored in the trade. However, the latter contention was contradicted by Weininger and Sadina; and there is force in defendant’s argument that the contract made the regulations a dictionary, particularly since the reference to Government grading was already in plaintiff’s initial cable to Stovicek.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant makes a further argument based on the impossibility of its obtaining broilers and fryers at the 33¢ price offered by plaintiff for the 2½–3 lbs. birds. There is no substantial dispute that, in late April, 1957 the price for 2½–3 lbs. broilers was between 35¢ and 37¢ per pound, and that when defendant entered into the contracts, it was well aware of this and intended to fill them by supplying fowl in these weights. It claims that plaintiff must likewise have known the market since plaintiff had reserved shipping space on April 23, three days before plaintiff’s cable to Stovicek, or, at least, that Stovicek was chargeable with such knowledge. It is scarcely an answer to say, as plaintiff does in its brief, that the 33¢ price offered [for] the 2½–3 lbs. “chickens” was closer to the prevailing 35¢ price for broilers than to the 30¢ at which defendant procured fowl. Plaintiff must have expected defendant to make some profit—certainly it could not have expected defendant deliberately to incur a loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, defendant relies on conduct by the plaintiff after the first shipment had been received. On May 28 plaintiff sent two cables complaining that the larger birds in the first shipment constituted “fowl.” Defendant answered with a cable refusing to recognize plaintiff’s objection and announcing “We have today ready for shipment 50,000 lbs. chicken 2½–3 lbs. 25,000 lbs. broilers 1½–2 lbs.,” these being the goods procured for shipment under the second contract, and asked immediate answer “whether we are to ship this merchandise to you and whether you will accept <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page68" class="pagebreak">68</span>the merchandise.” After several other cable exchanges, plaintiff replied on May 29 “Confirm again that merchandise is to be shipped since resold by us if not enough pursuant to contract chickens are shipped the missing quantity is to be shipped within ten days stop we resold to our customers pursuant to your contract chickens grade A you have to deliver us said merchandise we again state that we shall make you fully responsible for all resulting costs.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_3" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/12_chapter01.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> Defendant argues that if plaintiff was sincere in thinking it was entitled to young chickens, plaintiff would not have allowed the shipment under the second contract to go forward, since the distinction between broilers and chickens drawn in defendant’s cablegram must have made it clear that the larger birds would not be broilers. However, plaintiff answers that the cables show plaintiff was insisting on delivery of young chickens and that defendant shipped old ones at its peril. Defendant’s point would be highly relevant on another disputed issue—whether if liability were established, the measure of damages should be the difference in market value of broilers and stewing chicken in New York or the larger difference in Europe, but I cannot give it weight on the issue of interpretation. Defendant points out also that plaintiff proceeded to deliver some of the larger birds in Europe, describing them as “poulets”; defendant argues that it was only when plaintiff’s customers complained about this that plaintiff developed the idea that “chicken” meant “young chicken.” There is little force in this in view of plaintiff’s immediate and consistent protests.</p>
<p class="indent">When all the evidence is reviewed, it is clear that defendant believed it could comply with the contracts by delivering stewing chicken in the 2½–3 lbs. size. Defendant’s subjective intent would not be significant if this did not coincide with an objective meaning of “chicken.” Here it did coincide with one of the dictionary meanings, with the definition in the Department of Agriculture Regulations to which the contract made at least oblique reference, with at least some usage in the trade, with the realities of the market, and with what plaintiff’s spokesman had said. Plaintiff asserts it to be equally plain that plaintiff’s own subjective intent was to obtain broilers and fryers; the only evidence against this is the material as to market prices and this may not have been sufficiently brought home. In any event it is unnecessary to determine that issue. For plaintiff has the burden of showing that “chicken” was used in the narrower rather than in the broader sense, and this it has not sustained.</p>
<p class="indent">This opinion constitutes the Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint with costs.</p>

<p id="sec30" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. List the specific sources of information that Judge Friendly turns to in order to uncover the meaning of “chicken.” Which sources does Judge Friendly find persuasive and which unpersuasive? What reasons does he give for his treatment of the various sources? Do you agree with Judge Friendly’s assessment? How might you have anticipated Judge Friendly’s assessment were you the lawyer telling the story?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. In concluding that the plaintiff has not sustained its burden of persuasion that the contract used “chicken” in the narrower sense, did Judge Friendly conclude that there is no contract in this case?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Since both parties to this litigation were corporations, how can they be said to have “meant” or “intended” anything? Is it actually Bauer and Stovicek’s intent that is important? Should the court then be more concerned with whether Bauer is new to the business and not whether B.N.S. “was only beginning in the poultry trade”? Suppose Bauer was new in the trade, but that the sole shareholder, president and director of B.N.S. had been in the business for 30 years. In short, what does a corporation intend apart from what its agents and employees intend?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The meaning of the German phrase “<span class="italic">beteiligt werden</span>” was the $255 million question in <span class="italic">Buettner v. Bertelsmann AG</span> (Cal. Super. Ct. Sta. Barbara Cty) (Dec. 11, 2003) described below in an excerpt from <span class="italic">Lawyers Weekly USA</span>:<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_4" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/12_chapter01.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Two German entrepreneurs last month were awarded a minimum of 209.3 million Euros (worth $254.6 million as of the Dec. 11 verdict) in a complex lawsuit in which two German businessmen claimed they were cheated out of their equity stake in a European joint venture between Bertelsmann AG and America Online. Jan Henric Buettner, 39, and Andreas von Blottnitz, 38, helped Bertelsmann set up a 1995 joint venture to establish AOL Europe. They claimed that Bertelsmann and its former chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff, promised them partial ownership of the online venture company. When Bertelsmann sold its 50 percent share in the venture to AOL Time Warner in 2000 for $6.75 billion, however, Beuttner and von Blottnitz received nothing. In the early 1990s, Buettner and von Blottnitz were both rising young stars in the emergent European online media market. They founded a consulting firm in 1994, and were recruited by Middelhoff—then head of Bertelsmann’s multimedia and corporate development—to help develop the company’s new media/Internet strategy. According to their complaint, the plaintiffs had no interest in being employees of Bertelsmann, but agreed to work for Middelhoff in return for a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page70" class="pagebreak">70</span>“significant equity position” in the company’s Internet operation. Price said that the plaintiffs turned down job prospects with Microsoft and other companies because their agreement with Bertelsmann meant that they would get equity and manage the company’s online venture business. Despite repeated requests, the complaint alleges, Middelhoff refused to provide the plaintiffs with what they said was a 49 percent agreed-upon equity interest in Bertelsmann’s online media venture company. After Bertelsmann sold its 50 percent interest in AOL Europe, the dispute moved to California, home of the two plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Because of the disagreement over what exactly Bertelsmann promised the plaintiffs, the company’s contract with the two men was one of the most critical pieces of evidence in the trial. There was, however, a major catch: The contract was in German. Both sides hired translators to tell jurors exactly what the contract promised the plaintiffs. And both translators told jurors something different. The plaintiffs’ translator testified that the phrase <span class="italic">beteiligt werden</span> in the contract expressed the plaintiffs’ request for equity. The expert testified that this interpretation of the words was supported by the fact that it referred to <span class="italic">beteiligt werden</span> in a <span class="italic">gesellschaft</span>. The accepted translation of <span class="italic">gesellschaft</span> is a company.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Not so, said the defense. “The actual contract itself—if you read German, which none of the jurors or the judge did—referred to a specific executive incentive compensation plan,” [the defendant’s counsel] Murray said. He also said that the defense’s translator, a United Nations translator, was more qualified to translate the contract than the plaintiff’s expert, a professor of German literature at Stanford University. To counteract the defense translator’s testimony, [plaintiff’s counsel] Price said he was able to get German businesspeople and Bertelsmann executives to testify that the same phrase used in other documents meant equity. “Jurors found compelling evidence that these words <span class="italic">beteiligt werden</span> mean equity,” Price said. But defense counsel Murray said the debate over the contract wording was simply one example of why the case never should have been tried in the United States in the first place. “Jurors did their best,” he said. “But how do you determine who is right and who is wrong about the translation of words when you read nothing of the language yourself?”</p>

<p class="indent-t">The institution of contract may be based on unrealistic expectations about human capacity to plan for the future. A substantial criticism of American contract law and practice is that it often fails to recognize its limits and provides inadequate support for the parties to deal with these limits. The assumption seems to be that if the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page71" class="pagebreak">71</span>drafters are skilled enough, if they negotiate long enough, if the document is worked over until it discusses every contingency, then all will be well. In fact no contract can ever hope to be complete and to deal comprehensively with every aspect of the transaction. There will always be gaps to be filled in.</p>
<h4 id="sec32" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">C.    I<small>NTENTION</small> I<small>S A</small> F<small>ICTION</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent-t">In some cases the problem may lie more in the uncertainty of or conflicts between the parties’ intentions, rather than in the imprecision of the words used to express them. Contract rhetoric assumes that there is an intention that lies behind the expression of the agreement by the parties. In reality, people will have no intention regarding a subject that never crossed their conscious minds, and they may have conflicting intentions about other matters within the scope of their “agreement.”</p>
<h4 id="sec33" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">D.    O<small>BJECTIVE</small> M<small>ANIFESTATION OF</small> A<small>SSENT</small> A<small>LSO</small> I<small>S A</small> F<small>ICTION</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent-t">Contracting parties’ intentions are not fully formed much less congruent on all aspects of a transaction. This factual limitation on intention provides a strong reason for insisting that the meaning of a contract depends on the objective manifestations of assent. But assigning objective meaning to an agreement also is likely to be a fiction in which the “reasonable person” ends up strongly resembling the judge or juror who must decide the case. In short, courts are likely to insist that an agreement means what the court thinks it ought to mean. If a society is homogeneous and shares a strong common set of values, there is likely to be a high level of certainty on the objective meaning of external manifestations. If the deal is between strangers, if the deal is novel, or if it concerns matters as to which there is limited social consensus, the objective meaning will be to that extent uncertain. That is the common situation today, as trade and communications tie people all over the world together, and as even national consensus on crucial social assumptions seems more elusive.</p>

<p class="indent-t">The institution of contract is based on the assumption that a contract is made at one point in time and continues to control the parties thereafter. This assumption leads courts to retrospectively cast meaning on the parties’ agreement. As we shall <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page72" class="pagebreak">72</span>see in Chapter Eight, it also weakens the contract in the face of supervening events that demand reconsideration and modification of the deal. Time and tide wash away meaning and agreement. All contracts contain the element of futurity, but we can only plan for what we can imagine. As time flows, it is likely to bring changes the parties did not foresee or plan for and will change the values and interests that underlie the contract.</p>
<h4 id="sec35" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">F.    M<small>ANY</small> C<small>ONTRACTS ARE</small> B<small>EST</small> L<small>EFT</small> I<small>NCOMPLETE</small> D<small>ELIBERATELY</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent-t">Lawyers must balance their desire for precision and pressures to agree. A lawyer’s job is not to kill a deal that a (presumably well-advised) client wants. Nor should the lawyer unnecessarily prolong the process by raising technical drafting concerns and worries about unlikely contingencies. The result is that the contract often papers over disagreement with ambiguity or omission.</p>
<p class="indent">Some American lawyers believe that good drafting requires that all contingencies should be specified and provided for as precisely as possible. An appreciation of all knowable risks and careful drafting certainly is to be encouraged, but this approach is over-optimistic in assuming that it is possible to fully specify every contingency. It is not only impractical but also bad economics to attempt to provide for <span class="italic">every</span> contingency. Why spend all that time and energy worrying about remote contingencies? In any event, even the best lawyer cannot provide with precision for unimagined risks and must depend upon later interpretation by the parties and, if necessary, a court.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider, by contrast, the view that observers have attributed to Japanese practice. Accepting the indeterminacy of the future, the Japanese are said to conceive of a contract as establishing a relationship and a commitment mutually to pursue solutions to problems as they arise. Words cannot be made to do what people cannot; the unknowable remains so no matter how detailed the contract. What is written establishes the nature of the relationship, but it must be supplemented with sensible elements of good will to resolve problems when they arise by a process of harmonious accommodation.</p>
<p class="indent">What goes on in fact in American contract practice is often more like the Japanese than the American conception of what ought to be. Use of such terms as “interpretation” or “implication” to describe what a court does emphasizes the primary importance of what the court thinks the parties meant. As the search for intention becomes increasingly hypothetical, it becomes indistinguishable from other kinds of rule-making and standard-fixing: a decision not of what the parties <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page73" class="pagebreak">73</span>actually meant, but of what the parties to a contract like this one <span class="italic">should</span> mean in the opinion of the court. Inevitably this is apt to boil down in some cases to what the court thinks <span class="italic">it</span> would have meant in the situation before it.</p>
<p class="indent">But why should one expect anything different? A court, like the parties before it, does what it must in interpreting what is written and unwritten in the face of what happened but was not expected. The inevitable limits on cognition and verbal expression must be taken into account in any sensible view of contract as a social tool.</p>
<h4 id="sec36" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">G.    T<small>HE</small> L<small>AWYER AS</small> I<small>NTERPRETER</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">A lawyer plays many different roles, and his perspective as an interpreter will depend on his role.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">counselor</span> advising a client as to the meaning of an agreement is a very conservative creature. She is on the lookout for any conceivable source of trouble in order that the client may be forewarned. It means relatively little to her that a majority of the State Supreme Court is likely to adopt a favorable view of an ambiguous agreement. As a practical matter, such vindication will come too late to enable the client to avoid disaster. The counselor’s job is to keep the client out of trouble.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, the <span class="italic">drafter’s</span> perspective is basically one of avoidance and caution. By use of all the tools available he must devise a document that is likely to be interpreted to mean what the client wants it to mean (a job complicated by the likely circumstance that the client isn’t really sure what it wants in any detail). While a counselor often must advise on the basis of an agreement as it stands, the drafter is in a position to draft himself out of perceived problems. Moreover, the drafter often must deal with a counterpart, the person drafting for the other side who is trying to protect <span class="italic">her</span> client. These positions are not inevitably hostile. If the deal is sensible and carefully thought out, then a lucid exposition is most likely to be in both sides’ interests. The drafter’s job can present fascinating creative opportunities. When done well, drafting is not merely a matter of riveting sections of boilerplate into place but of stretching the spare outline of the agreement reached by the parties to cover the body of a coherent working relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">advocate’s</span> perspective, of course, is very different. She must take the agreement as written, along with the existence of a serious dispute between the parties concerning its operation. Her job is to find persuasive arguments for the client’s position and counters for the arguments she anticipates from the other side. She hopes to find previously decided cases that support her arguments. From the advocate’s viewpoint, it is almost a complete answer to say that the court has previously <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page74" class="pagebreak">74</span>determined that her interpretation is correct; after all, that court is her immediate audience.</p>
<p class="indent">The cases that you are studying should help you to operate effectively in all of these areas, even though they are all products of litigation. In litigation the question “What is the agreement reached by the parties?” is considered entirely from the perspective of a court assessing the post-formation conduct of parties to a contract. Cases decided from this viewpoint supply the major part of the material on which a lawyer must base his strategy in practically all of the roles that he must play. This is because—in the final analysis—the effective meaning of any contract is what a court will say it is.</p>
<h4 id="sec37" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">H.    P<small>OSITIVE</small> L<small>AW</small> S<small>OMETIMES</small> D<small>ETERMINES</small> M<small>EANING</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">Beyond what the parties expressly said, beyond what they are deemed to have said by implication, and beyond the community and trade usage context that give meaning to an agreement, a lawyer must also consider the terms that society for its own reasons imposes on the parties to an agreement. Modern contracts are increasingly governed by a complex web of government regulation ranging from such statutes as the Uniform Commercial Code, labor codes, and tax codes, to administrative regulations, rules, and guidelines. Contracts setting the terms of employment of workers, of issuance of securities to capitalize a business, of the sale of products to customers, or of a promotional campaign to encourage sales simply cannot be understood without detailed examination of the host of pertinent statutes, rules, and regulations now on the books.</p>
<h4 id="sec38" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">I.    C<small>ONSTRUCTING A</small> C<small>OHERENT</small>, P<small>ERSUASIVE</small> I<small>NTERPRETATION</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">Each of the sources of meaning that we have considered—the express terms of an agreement, the implied terms, custom and usage, and the terms imposed by the law through statute or regulation—contributes to the definition of the “total legal obligation which results from the parties’ agreement.” It is that total meaning which a lawyer must always seek.</p>
<p class="indent">To an unjustifiable extent the law has treated the process of seeking the total meaning as if it were composed of a set of watertight compartments: defining the words, interpreting the meaning of groups of words based on the context, implying <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page75" class="pagebreak">75</span>and constructing meanings that the parties have not made explicit, testing the terms used against trade usage, looking to custom in the community, ferreting out special meanings the parties may have established in the course of their dealings, imposing meaning on the agreement for social purposes, and so on. In fact, one can do all of these things to the same contract term at the same time—and one often does so. One cannot consider interpretation of an element of the agreement, such as its express terms, in isolation from consideration of all of the other elements. The agreement must be seen as a coherent entity composed of all of these.</p>
<p class="indent">The maddening thing about this complex process is that one is likely to be led to very different results depending on which element of the agreement (the words, context, custom, social needs, etc.) one permits to be dominant in the interpretive process. Nothing in the literature will help the lawyer or judge very much in choosing among competing modes of interpretation. In a particular situation some approaches will make sense while others will seem silly. One must wrestle with those that make sense and hope that one’s feel for the situation is similar to that of the judge who will decide the case.</p>

<p class="indent">Parties are bound by the reasonable meaning of what they said and not by what they thought. … It may be said that the purpose of the rule is to carry out the intentions of the parties in the great majority of cases; but it seems better to say that its purpose is to secure the fulfillment of the promisee’s reasonable expectations as induced by the promisor’s act. In the law of contract as in the law of tort, men are expected to live up to the standard of the reasonably prudent man. If the expressions of the parties are capable of two different and equally reasonable interpretations, and neither one negligently misled the other, there is no contract. The same is true if both are equally negligent. If they integrate their agreement in specific words, they are bound in accordance with the meaning given to those words by the court.</p>
<p class="indent">The legal relations consequent upon offer and acceptance are not wholly dependent, even upon the reasonable meaning of the words and acts of the parties. The law determines these relations in the light of subsequent circumstances, these often being totally unforeseen by the parties. In such cases it is sometimes said that the law will create that relation which the parties would have intended had they foreseen. The fact is, however, that the decision will depend upon the notions of the court as to policy, welfare, justice, right and wrong, such notions often being inarticulate and subconscious.</p>

<p class="indent">It has already been remarked that the Courts will generally enforce consequences logically implied in the language of contracts, wills, statutes, and other legal documents and transactions. The point now to be noticed is that the legal doctrine of implied terms goes much farther than this. Judges are accustomed to read into documents and transactions many terms that are not logically implied in them. As an academic matter, non-logical implications may be classified into three kinds: (i) of terms that the parties (the plural shall throughout include the singular) probably had in mind but did not trouble to express; (ii) of terms that the parties, whether or not they actually had them in mind would probably have expressed if the question had been brought to their attention; and (iii) of terms that the parties, whether or not they had them in mind or would have expressed them if they had foreseen the difficulty, are implied by the Court because of the Court’s view of fairness or policy or in consequence of rules of law. Of these three kinds of non-logical implications (i) is an effort to arrive at actual intention; (ii) is an effort to arrive at hypothetical or conditional intention—the intention that the parties would have had if they had foreseen the difficulty; (iii) is not concerned with the intention of the parties except to the extent that the term implied by the Court may be excluded by an expression of positive intention to the contrary.</p>

<p id="sec41" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Berg v. Hudesman</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Washington Supreme Court, 1990.</p>
<p class="sectionb">115 Wash.2d 657, 801 P.2d 222.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ B<small>RACHTENBACH</small>, J. This suit concerns a 99–year ground lease. The main issue is the meaning of the rent payment clause. The trial court granted summary judgment to the landlord, held that the lease was not ambiguous, determined the meaning of the rental clause, and awarded back rent to the landlord based upon the trial court’s interpretation of the rental clause. By unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in the main but remanded for determination of certain facts which existed at the inception of the lease. We reverse the trial court, modify the Court of Appeals opinion, and remand for trial.</p>
<p class="indent">The ground lease, executed in 1959, terminates in 2058. The ground tenant, defendant, removed a residence from the property, as allowed by the lease agreement, and constructed a commercial building on the land. This commercial building was originally leased to Safeway Stores for 15 years. Upon Safeway’s removal, the tenant converted the building to a small shopping center which was subleased to a number of tenants during the period at issue.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page77" class="pagebreak">77</div>
<p class="indent">In August 1987, the landlord brought the present suit, contending that for several years the defendant incorrectly calculated the rent due the landlord under the ground lease.</p>
<p class="indent">As will be seen, the rent due the landlord under the ground lease is calculated with respect to what constitutes “gross rentals” from the subtenants and what may be deducted therefrom to ascertain “net rentals.” “Net rentals” is the amount to which a formula set out in the ground lease applies for division of income between the landlord and the tenant, the parties in this suit.</p>
<p class="blockquote">The lease contains the following provision:</p>
<p class="blockquoteis">(3)  Rental. The rental shall be Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) per year, payable in advance on or before the 19th day of October, 1959, of each year during the term of this lease. Receipt of Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) paid as rental for the first year of said term is hereby acknowledged. It is expressly provided that on the first of the month in which the annual rent falls due, Lessee, prior to paying the annual rental of $5,000.00, each year during the term hereof, commencing with the fifteenth (15) year, shall refer to the then current United States Consumer Price Index (all items) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor (1947–1949 = 100). If such index reading at date hereof reflects an increase or decrease in the purchasing power of the United States Dollar equal to five percent (5%) or more, the minimum rent payment hereunder shall be proportionately increased or decreased to the end that rent payments are annually adjusted to maintain the same purchasing power they represented at date hereof, provided that the total increase or decrease above or below the original rental of $5,000.00 per year shall in no event exceed three percent (3%) multiplied by the number of years of said term which shall have expired. In the event the said Consumer Price Index is modified or replaced, the comparable effective cost of living index published by the United States Department of Labor or other Federal agency shall be employed using reasonable and accepted conversion factors as necessary.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1s">In addition to the above mentioned rental, Lessee shall pay ten (10%) per cent of net rentals received after the third year of said term from tenants of any buildings constructed on said property. If Lessee uses or enters into any agreement for the use of said property or any portion thereof for parking or thoroughfare purposes for the benefit of any business conducted in a building or buildings on other property, a portion of any such building or buildings shall be assumed to be on the above described property for the purpose of computing rental hereto. Said portion shall be in the same proportion as the area of the above described property used for such purposes bears to the total area used for building, parking and thoroughfare purposes for the benefit of such business. Net rentals shall be defined as gross rentals from the actual tenants, less payments made for taxes and assessments, insurance on said premises, management fees not to exceed five (5%) per cent of gross rentals and real estate commissions not to exceed five (5%) per cent of the gross rentals for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page78" class="pagebreak">78</span>the first ten (10) years and two-and-a-half (2½%) per cent of the gross rentals thereafter, and depreciation actually taken for income tax purposes.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1s">Commencing with the sixteenth (16) year after completion of the first building constructed on said property, the rental shall be as computed above, or it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1s">Lessor shall have the right each year for a period of ten (10) consecutive working days selected by them to audit those books of Lessee pertaining to rentals received by Lessee from such tenants.</p>
<p class="indent">In broad terms, the question posed is the interpretation of the subject lease…. It is deceptively simple to state the purpose of a court in interpreting a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">“The cardinal rule with which all interpretation begins is that its purpose is to ascertain the intention of the parties.” Corbin, <span class="italic">The Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule</span>, 50 Cornell L.Q. 161, 162 (1965); 4 S. Williston, Contracts § 601, at 306 (3d ed. 1961).</p>
<p class="indent">As would be expected, problems of contract interpretation have long been a source of judicial opinion. The subject has produced thousands of cases, numerous texts and countless commentaries. A study of these materials, including Washington cases, leads us to concur with the observation: “[T]he rules produced by accumulated decisions as to how such discovery [of the parties’ intention] shall be conducted often overlap and sometimes produce hindrance rather than help, while reconciliation of all cases is a task neither possible nor worth the effort * * *.” <span class="italic">Nicoll v. Pittsvein Coal Co.</span>, 269 F. 968, 971 (2d Cir.1920).</p>
<p class="indent">In approaching contract interpretation, every court should heed the strong words of Corbin:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[I]t can hardly be insisted on too often or too vigorously that language at its best is always a defective and uncertain instrument, that words do not define themselves, that terms and sentences in a contract, a deed, or a will do not apply themselves to external objects and performances, that the meaning of such terms and sentences consists of the ideas that they induce in the mind of some individual person who uses or hears or reads them, and that seldom in a litigated case do the words of a contract convey one identical meaning to the two contracting parties or to third persons.</p>
<p class="noindent">3 A. Corbin, Contracts § 536 (1960). Holmes was more poetic:</p>
<p class="blockquote">A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.</p>
<p class="indent">A second major point applicable to contract interpretation is that the various principles of interpretation should not be applied as absolutes. They “are to be taken <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page79" class="pagebreak">79</span>as suggestive working rules only * * *. They will be harmful if they are taken as dogmatic directions that must be followed, or if they mislead us into thinking that language has only one meaning, the one absolutely correct.” Various efforts have been made to compile a set of rules of contract interpretation. Patterson, <span class="italic">The Interpretation and Construction of Contracts</span>, 64 Colum.L.Rev. 833, 852 (1964) (listing ten “standard maxims” of contract interpretation); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 202 (1981) (listing rules in aid of interpretation). Each set of rules is subject to Corbin’s caution. “There is some doubt whether they [maxims of interpretation] have reliable guidance value for judges, or are merely justifications for decisions arrived at on other grounds, which may or may not be revealed in the opinion.” Patterson, 64 Colum.L.Rev. at 852.</p>
<p class="indent">With the above observations in mind we turn to the central issue of contract interpretation in this case. There remains to be discussed the interpretation issue which presents the greatest difficulty. If the disputed language is written, will the proponent of one meaning be permitted to aid his cause by verbal testimony? If so, what is the permissible range such testimony can take? On these important details the Washington cases are in confusion.</p>
<p class="indent">There are cases in which the court examined the circumstances surrounding the execution of a writing as an aid to its interpretation and sustained the admissibility of the pertinent evidence even though the writing might on its face be unambiguous. The position taken in these cases is the one endorsed by Professors Corbin and Williston and by the Restatement of Contracts. It is the only approach which can consistently yield interpretations likely to coincide with the meanings the parties contemplated.</p>
<p class="indent">There are other cases in which the court indicated that it will not look beyond the four corners of a contract writing unless what appears within those four corners is ambiguous. The reason is variously stated as an interpretation principle, or as an application of the parol evidence rule. Neither reason is persuasive….</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the accuracy of the conclusion that seldom will any word or phrase carry only a single meaning which is readily discernible by any reader, this court on occasion has embraced the “plain meaning rule.” The Plain Meaning Rule states that if a writing, or the term in question, appears to be plain and unambiguous on its face, its meaning must be determined from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence of any nature. In following this rule, this court has held that only if a contract is ambiguous on its face will the court look to evidence of the parties’ intent as shown by the contract as a whole, its subject matter and objective, the circumstances of its making, the subsequent conduct of the parties, and the reasonableness of their interpretations.</p>
<p class="indent">The instant case presents a clear opportunity for this court to resolve the long-standing confusion engendered by inconsistent holdings in this area.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page80" class="pagebreak">80</div>
<p class="indent">We now hold that extrinsic evidence is admissible as to the entire circumstances under which the contract was made, as an aid in ascertaining the parties’ intent. We adopt the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 212, 214(c) (1981). Section 212 provides:</p>
<p class="blockquotei">(1) The interpretation of an integrated agreement is directed to the meaning of the terms of the writing or writings in the light of the circumstances, in accordance with the rules stated in this Chapter.</p>
<p class="blockquotei">(2) A question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined by the trier of fact if it depends on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or on a choice among reasonable inferences to be drawn from extrinsic evidence. Otherwise a question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined as a question of law.</p>
<p class="noindent">As explained in comment <span class="italic">b</span> to this section:</p>
<p class="blockquote">It is sometimes said that extrinsic evidence cannot change the plain meaning of a writing, but meaning can almost never be plain except in a context. Accordingly, the rule stated in Subsection (1) is not limited to cases where it is determined that the language used is ambiguous. Any determination of meaning or ambiguity should only be made in the light of the relevant evidence of the situation and relations of the parties, the subject matter of the transaction, preliminary negotiations and statements made therein, usages of trade, and the course of dealing between the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">This court’s line of cases which includes <span class="italic">Stender v. Twin City Foods, Inc.,</span> [<span class="italic">infra</span>], is in line with the Restatement and is in line with ascertaining the parties’ actual intent.</p>
<p class="indent">In discerning the parties’ intent, subsequent conduct of the contracting parties may be of aid, and the reasonableness of the parties’ respective interpretations may also be a factor in interpreting a written contract.</p>
<p class="indent">We thus reject the theory that ambiguity in the meaning of contract language must exist before evidence of the surrounding circumstances is admissible. Cases to the contrary are overruled.</p>
<p class="indent">Another issue involving interpretation which may be relevant in this case concerns the possibility that language used in the lease is technical or constitutes terms of art. If so, the general rule is that such language is to be given its technical meaning when used in a transaction within its technical field….</p>
<p class="indent">… In light of our adoption of the context rule for interpreting written contracts in accord with the parties’ intent, the summary judgment in favor of the landlord must be reversed and this matter must be remanded for trial. As noted, the trial court refused to consider evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the contract under the now disapproved “plain meaning rule.” As explained hereafter, there are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page81" class="pagebreak">81</span>material questions of fact remaining as to the intent of the contracting parties and interpretation of the ground lease.</p>
<p class="indent">The lease in this case well illustrates why extrinsic evidence is necessary to assist the court in interpreting words and applying them to the actual events in order to ascertain and implement the intentions of the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">The lease provides for a possible alternative computation of rent commencing with the 16th year. The record discloses that the original tenant’s sublease, the Safeway Stores lease, was for 15 years. The parties had no dispute as to rent calculation during those 15 years. The Safeway lease is relevant because the rental clause calls for a different formula “[c]ommencing with the sixteenth (16) year after completion of the first building constructed on said property.” That lease (which constitutes extrinsic evidence) is not in the record and was not considered by the trial court. How do the terms of the original lease bear on the meaning and purpose of the different rent formula in the ground lease which comes into operation at the end of that sublease?</p>
<p class="indent">“Gross rentals” is the starting point for determining the division between the landlord and the tenant, but the term “gross rentals” is not defined. What did the parties intend to be the meaning of that phrase? The trial court held the term included “all amounts received from subtenants of the shopping center.” Under this interpretation the ground tenant is out of pocket 50 percent of the reimbursement from the subtenants. For example, if the ground tenant pays out $10,000 for common area maintenance and is reimbursed that $10,000 by a subtenant, he is then whole, but under the trial court’s holding, he must pay $5,000 to the landlord.</p>
<p class="indent">In actual operation, according to the record, in 1 year actual common maintenance expenses paid by the ground tenant were $28,952.78. By reimbursement from subtenants the ground tenant is made whole, i.e., he neither loses nor gains. But under the landlord’s interpretation, adopted by the trial court, the tenant must (1) include $28,952.78 in gross rents, and (2) cannot deduct those actual expenses to calculate net rentals against which the 50 percent rental formula is applied. Therefore, the tenant must pay $14,476.39 to the landlord.</p>
<p class="indent">Given this result, if the trial court determines the language is subject to two possible constructions, it should apply the following principle: When a provision is subject to two possible constructions, one of which would make the contract unreasonable and imprudent and the other of which would make it reasonable and just, we will adopt the latter interpretation.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast to the trial court’s interpretation of the lease, the Court of Appeals held that if such expenses had been paid directly by a subtenant, they were not gross rentals. The Court of Appeals held that so long as reimbursements were of the exact same nature as those paid by the original subtenants they were not gross rentals. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page82" class="pagebreak">82</span>Apparently the Court of Appeals divined the intent of the parties for 99 years from the terms of the first 15–year sublease, but modified that by excluding direct payments by subtenants to the extent that the landlord would have to include such direct payments within his income for federal income tax purposes. We find no support in the record that the treatment of a money item was to be governed by federal income tax law. We note that when income tax law was relevant, it was expressly so provided, e.g., the deduction for depreciation in arriving at “net rental” referred to “depreciation actually taken for income tax purposes.” (As an aside, we note that even that specificity could create a problem of interpretation if the tax deduction allowed by Internal Revenue Service were different from that actually taken.)</p>
<p class="indent">Adding to the problem of interpretation of the parties’ lease, the language “gross rentals from actual tenants” requires reference to rental income from the subtenants. The only sublease in the record provides for the subtenant to pay a proportionate share of specified expenses, including operating expenses and expenses of maintaining common areas of the shopping center. However, the sublease specifically states that such proportionate share is “in addition to the rent.” What is the effect of the subleases’ characterization of income?</p>
<p class="indent">Further questions remain. Under the lease definition of “net rentals,” the ground tenant could deduct from the proportionate share paid by subtenants those amounts representing taxes and insurance, but not amounts paid out of pocket for common area maintenance and operation. The amount reimbursed to the ground tenant is significant, e.g., $28,952.78 in the rent year ending in October 1987. The trial court even included within gross rentals interest paid to the ground tenant on funds held by the property manager before rent was due the landlord. These facts seem to require application of the principle noted above that the court should take into account “the reasonableness of respective interpretations advocated by the parties.” <span class="italic">Stender v. Twin City Foods, Inc.</span>, 82 Wash.2d 250, 254 (1973).</p>
<p class="indent">Continuing the interpretation confusion is the fact that the lease provides that its term shall be 99 years. Paragraph 3 provides: “The rental shall be Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) per year * * * of each year during the term of this lease.” The lease later describes the $5,000 as “minimum rent payment hereunder” with an adjustment consistent with the Consumer Price Index.</p>
<p class="indent">The lease goes on to provide that “[i]n addition to the above mentioned rental,” there shall be paid a percentage of net rent after the third year. Thus, from the third year through the 15th year, it is clear that the $5,000 is paid in addition to the specified percentage of net rentals. The problem arises from the language applicable to the 16th year and subsequent years. It provides that the rental shall be “as computed above” (i.e., the adjusted $5,000 plus 10 percent of net rentals) or “it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals, whichever is greater.” The obvious question is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page83" class="pagebreak">83</span>whether the minimum rent is in addition to the 50 percent or is no longer to be considered. Preceding the 50 percent language the lease provides in two separate paragraphs that the $5,000, as adjusted, shall be paid “each year during the term hereof.” The lease defines the “term” as 99 years. If the rent is to be calculated under the phrase “or it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals,” without the additional minimum rent, there is a conflict with the provision that the $5,000, as adjusted, shall be paid every year during the 99–year term.</p>
<p class="indent">Avoidance of this conflict presents another problem, however. If $5,000 is to be paid every year during the lease term, in addition to a percentage of net rentals, then the language applicable to the 16th year and thereafter seems to make no sense. That is, $5,000 (as adjusted) plus 10 percent of net rentals would be compared to $5,000 (as adjusted) plus 50 percent of net rentals.</p>
<p class="indent">Another significant question of intent and meaning arises from the listing of permissible deductions from gross rentals to arrive at net rentals. This question exists even under the landlord’s contention that the only deductions from gross rentals are those defined in the lease. The question comes from the authorization to deduct “real estate commissions not to exceed five (5%) per cent of the gross rentals for the first ten (10) years and two-and-a-half (2½%) per cent of the gross rentals thereafter.” The landlord contends that the limitation for deductible real estate commissions refers to the years of the master lease. That is, during the first 10 years of the 99–year term, the ground tenant can deduct up to 5 percent of the gross rentals for real estate commissions and only 2½ percent for the remaining 89 years. The ground tenant argues that this limitation refers to the length of the terms of the subleases. Thus, if, in the 20th year of the master lease, there was negotiated a 15–year sublease, the ground tenant could deduct up to 5 percent of the gross rent for real estate commissions from that particular lease for 10 years and up to 2½ percent for the remaining 5 years. Again, the differences in the respective contentions are significant. In the lease year ending in October 1986, the ground tenant paid and deducted real estate commissions of $30,141; the landlord’s interpretation allowed only $5,067.78.</p>
<p class="indent">A major point of dispute is how to arrive at “net rentals” for the 50/50 percent division after the 15th year. Stated again, the lease provides that at that time: “[T]he rental shall be as computed above, or it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals, whichever is greater.” The phrase “as computed above” can only refer to the preceding paragraph which calls for the minimum $5,000, as adjusted, plus 10 percent of the net rentals. “Net rentals” is defined as “gross rentals [undefined] from the actual tenants, less payments made for taxes and assessments, insurance on said premises, management fees not to exceed five (5%) per cent of gross rentals and real estate commissions * * * [as above described], and depreciation actually taken for income tax purposes.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page84" class="pagebreak">84</div>
<p class="indent">The question is whether the phrase “net rentals” to which the 50 percent applies means the same as is defined in the preceding paragraph and particularly whether the deductions from gross rentals are limited to those authorized in arriving at the sum to which the “10 percent of net rentals” is applied. What the parties intended is not clear. When calculating the sum to which the 10 percent applies, after the 15th year, reference is made to the methodology of the preceding paragraph. The 50 percent calculation is preceded by the word “or” and “net rentals” is not referenced to the preceding paragraph as it is in the first part of the sentence. The ground tenant argues that the change from a $5,000 adjusted minimum plus 10 percent of the defined net rentals to 50 percent of undefined net rentals necessarily means that the parties intended a different formula to arrive at a 50/50 percent division of net rentals. He supports his position with the fact that this change in formula coincided with the termination of the known term of the 15–year lease of the first subtenant, that the ground tenant’s improvements represent two-thirds of the assessed value of the land and improvements, and that the interpretation and intent he advances is that commonly understood by those operating within the realm of long-term ground leases. This latter point is supported by affidavits from persons with knowledge of such standards.</p>
<p class="indent">From accountings in the record, the tenant constructs a model of net incomes to each party under the landlord’s theory. In his worst scenario the landlord in 1 year nets $63,280 and the tenant $1,160. In the best year for the tenant, his figures show $80,108 to the landlord and $59,106 to the tenant. The tenant contends that over a 5–year period the average net return is 77 percent to the landlord and 23 percent to the tenant. By setting forth the tenant’s contentions on this point we do not mean to imply that they are correct or factually established. What the illustrations do raise is the initial question whether the parties in fact did intend such results. If they did so intend, so be it. However, if it is determined that was not their intent, then the court must determine a more reasonable interpretation from all the circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">In conclusion, it is apparent from our analysis of the contract language that there are certain ambiguities appearing on the face of the lease instrument. Lest there be any doubt as to our holding, we expressly state that we are not implicitly applying the “plain meaning rule.” Whether or not ambiguity is apparent from the face of a contract, evidence of the circumstances of the making of the contract is admissible. We reject the plain meaning rule and expressly adopt the context rule as the applicable rule for ascertaining the parties’ intent and interpreting written contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court is reversed and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page85" class="pagebreak">85</div>
<p id="sec42" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. This case involves the interpretation of the rent clause in a 99-year lease. Those making an agreement with a term greatly exceeding their life expectancies may provide for future contingencies as best they can, but their ability to do so inevitably will be limited. In this case the lease fixes a base rent ($5,000) that is to increase after 15 years to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index, reflecting inflation. In addition, the tenant is to pay 10% of “net rentals” it receives from those to whom it sublets the property. It seems safe to assume that this percentage rent was larger than the base rent, certainly during the 15-year term when the property was leased to a supermarket. Thirty years later the parties find themselves in a dispute over the meaning of this clause. To what sources might the trial court turn on retrial to find out what the clause means? How available is each kind of evidence likely to be after more than 30 years?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What is wrong with this rent clause that creates the need for interpretation? Sometimes interpretation is needed because the parties failed to deal with a situation. Interpretation fills in gaps. Sometimes interpretation is needed because the parties did not express themselves clearly and it is necessary to figure out what the words mean. It may be that they made a typographical or grammatical mistake that interferes with understanding. We all use familiar words in unclear or incorrect ways and only realize the problem when someone points out the obscurity or when a situation arises that demands we think more precisely about the terms used. Some people may think they speak with perfect precision, but few approach this goal. Indeed, for most purposes it wouldn’t be worth the time and effort to sharpen each statement until it is as precise as possible. Instead, we interject “You know what I mean?” in every other sentence and move ahead. Such attempts at precision are likely to be futile in any event; in the real world we often only appreciate the problems <span class="italic">after</span> they arise, not by anticipation.</p>
<p class="indent">Other times interpretation is necessary because the parties each think the contract term has an unambiguous meaning, but they differ on what that meaning is. In this case the claim might be that the terms defining gross rent and net rent are ambiguous and might mean any one of several things, or the claim might be that the contract defines the terms in inconsistent ways in different parts of the document, or it might be that the narrow meaning of the words used produces a nonsensical result as is shown by the parties’ practices for more than 30 years. Finally, there apparently were some judges in Washington, at least until this decision, who believed that words and sentences have a single plain meaning and that the job of the judge is to determine and apply the words on the page without consideration of any confusing context.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page86" class="pagebreak">86</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Who drafted this troublesome clause? In a portion of this opinion omitted here, the court states that the lease was drafted by the landlord’s attorney and recites the ancient canon that ambiguous contract terms are to be interpreted against the party who drafted them. This idea is sometimes referred to by the Latin term <span class="italic">contra proferendum.</span> That principle sounds sensible enough, but in this case both sides were represented by counsel in a large transaction, and the dispute focuses on the central term of the agreement, a rent clause, that both sides presumably focused on and negotiated. Weren’t the tenant and his lawyer just as responsible for getting the rent term right as the landlord? Didn’t these clients pay these lawyers to draft them a lease? If the lawyers draft an inadequate rent term, shouldn’t they be liable for their clients’ losses? After all, if you hire a surgeon to remove your appendix and she doesn’t do it correctly, you may have a claim for malpractice.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. In <span class="italic">Hearst Communications, Inc. v. Seattle Times Co.</span>, 154 Wash.2d 493 (2005), the Washington Supreme Court acknowledged that notwithstanding <span class="italic">Berg</span>’s emphasis on context, including relevant extrinsic evidence, Washington continued to adhere to the objective theory of contract: The goal of the interpretive process is “to determine the parties’ intent by focusing on the objective manifestations in the agreement, rather than on the unexpressed subjective intent of the parties.” <span class="italic">Id.</span> at 503. Can you reconcile the objective theory of contract with <span class="italic">Berg</span>’s methodology for contract interpretation?</p>
