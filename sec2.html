<h2 id="sec44" class="chap_tit"><span class="bold">R<small>EMEDIES:</small> H<small>OW THE</small> L<small>AW</small> E<small>NFORCES</small> P<small>ROMISES</small></span></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">How</span></span> society enforces a promise is intimately related to <span class="bold"><span class="italic">why</span></span> promises are enforced. Through the complexities of contract enforcement runs a simple principle: The basic source of contract obligations is the undertaking of the promisor to the promisee. When the promisee’s expectation is disappointed, its remedy is based on the value of the promised performance to the promisee. As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., put it in T<small>HE</small> C<small>OMMON</small> L<small>AW</small> 234–37 (Howe ed., 1963):</p>
<p class="blockquote">The only universal consequence of a legally binding promise is that the law makes the promisor pay damages if the promised event does not come to pass. In every case it leaves him free from interference until the time for fulfillment has gone by, and therefore free to break his contract if he chooses…. When a man commits a tort, he incurs, by force of the law, a liability to damages, measured by certain rules. When a man makes a contract, he incurs, by force of the law, a liability to damages, unless a certain promised event comes to pass. But, unlike the case of torts, as the contract is by mutual consent, the parties themselves, expressly or by implication, fix the rule by which the damages are to be measured. The old law seems to have regarded it as technically in the election of the promisor to perform or to pay damages. It is true that, as people when contracting contemplate performance, not breach, they commonly say little or nothing as to what shall happen in the latter event, and the common rules have been worked out by common sense, which has established what the parties probably would have said if they had spoken about the matter….</p>
<p class="indent">If promise-enforcement stemmed from a high value on the moral quality of keeping one’s word, those who break their promises would be seen as morally deficient and deserving punishment. Breach of contract might be treated as a crime and subject to heavy afflictive sanctions. At the very least, an emphasis on promise-keeping might lead to a set of remedies which would force people to keep their promises and in which court orders to a breaching party to perform would play a large role. What more obvious and accurate reflection of this moral imperative would there be than for the judges in <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span> to order Southland to deliver the plywood to Best?</p>
<p class="indent">The law, however, does not treat contract breach as a moral fault or a crime or an occasion for punitive damages, even when the harm is clear and the failure to perform deliberate. Why does the law attach no great stigma to those who fail to keep their promises? The social values underlying this attitude are not hard to find. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page88" class="pagebreak">88</span>Modern capitalist society places a high value on producing material goods and facilitating profitable market exchange. Business planning, the rational allocation of resources, and the extension of credit all depend on contracting in risky situations. Because it is desirable that people contract, it is important that the law not erect discouragingly high barriers that would make it too hard to get out of contracts that turn sour. The material plenty of modern life is said to depend on cheap contract.</p>
<p class="indent">These assumptions can be challenged on many levels. Some may doubt whether the heavy emphasis on material plenty is socially healthy. Others may wonder why we should encourage economic activity by those who will only commit themselves if assured that they can bug out if things don’t work to their liking. Others question whether the marginal gain from such economic activity offsets the great loss and dislocation from disappointed contract expectations caused by letting promisors breach without penalty. Such issues are worthy of extended discussion, but they cannot be resolved definitively in this course. See Seana V. Shiffrin, <span class="italic">The Divergence of Contract and Promise</span>, 120 H<small>ARV</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 708 (2007).</p>
<p class="indent">In any event, American law generally does not make people perform their promises, but instead awards money damages as a substitute for the promised performance. None of the judges in <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span> considers ordering Southland to deliver the plywood to Best. Instead, Best seeks a sum of money that will compensate it for the loss of that promised performance. Very soon you will become aware that money damages often are an imperfect substitute for performance. A general characteristic of contract law is that it leaves disappointed parties inadequately compensated for their losses when the other side fails to perform. One source of this inadequacy is that the rules governing contract damages fail to recognize or, by making proof difficult, severely limit the disappointed party’s ability to recover many actual losses. Another important limit on the usefulness of giving damages as a substitute for performance is the uncertainty and other costs of collecting damages.</p>
<p class="indent">A prevailing plaintiff is not guaranteed payment of court-assessed damages. If the defendant does not voluntarily pay a court judgment, the plaintiff (now a “judgment creditor”) may cause the sheriff to levy upon and seize the defendant’s property, which the sheriff will then sell, subject to any prior liens, paying the plaintiff only after deducting his own fees out of the proceeds. But the judgment debtor may have no property to seize in the jurisdiction, or the property he has may be exempt from execution under the law. In many cases, a judgment amounts to no more than a hunting license, but the rules of the hunt are limiting, there is often little game in the forest, and there are likely to be other hunters after the same quarry. The net result is that often even after a full and final adjudication of a breach of a contractual promise, there will be no <span class="italic">effective</span> legal remedy. Nor is the judgment, even if collected, likely to fully compensate the injured party for the out-of-pocket <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page89" class="pagebreak">89</span>expenses of hiring an attorney or for the market interest lost on the money paid late. In short, the law is surprisingly tender to contract breakers.</p>
<p class="indent">Remedies awarded for breach of promise primarily vindicate narrow economic interests. Compensation usually is limited to out-of-pocket and market losses. Why should nonviolent larceny be punished, but those who breach faith by failing to perform their promises only pay economic damages? Penal sanctions are not reserved only for shocking or depraved behavior. Traffic regulations are enforced by fines and incarceration, as well as the generous damage rules of tort law. What value choices justify treating these rules as subject to such heavy sanctions but being so tender to promise breakers?</p>
<p class="indent">The standard approach to contract remedies tends to treat all kinds of promises alike. This produces an analysis that makes sense for promises strongly grounded in purely economic calculations (isolated sales transactions are the model) but unsatisfying for contracts that have strong non-economic dimensions. The law does recognize non-economic injuries in limited cases when it finds that the parties contemplated mental distress as a foreseeable consequence of breach. Mental suffering damages have been applied to funeral directors who breach the funeral contract by dumping the body unceremonially on the floor or mixing the loved one’s ashes with those of unknown persons. In general, however, this approach is rarely and narrowly applied. Many of the cases that are likely to be most troubling regarding contract remedies involve relationships with duration, reliance by parties on the continued performance of the promise, or strong emotional elements that are crucial to the motivation of the agreement. Yet there seems to be little inclination to follow a general principle that contract law should consider such elements in every case.</p>
<p class="indent">This Chapter repeatedly points out the weaknesses of contract remedies and how frequently disappointed contract makers are undercompensated for their losses by contract law. In the next Chapter, we will examine how the law tries to make up for these weaknesses and reaches out for more adequate remedies. In the end, you are likely to remain somewhat disappointed. When it is said that someone has a legal right, that statement in effect is a prediction that a court will award a remedy. In general, people who feel the other side has not performed a contract want what is coming to them, not just an impressive piece of paper proclaiming that they are right. If there is no effective remedy for its violation, a legal right remains, at least to lawyers and clients, a rather abstract value.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, do not fall too soon into the lawyer’s tendency of identifying all remedies with court remedies. The law reflects deep social values that have their own strong sanctioning power. By telling people what is right and wrong, the law leads most people to do the right thing. Rebecca Stone, <span class="italic">Contracts from the Internal Point of View</span>, 117 C<small>OLUM</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. __ (2017). It is less the fear of damages than the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page90" class="pagebreak">90</span>commitment to social values that leads people to honor their obligations. Our behavior is influenced by nonlegal community and group sanctions and the fear of loss of reputation. This is particularly true of contracts because most contracts are not isolated deals between strangers. Most bargains are business transactions among people whose lives and livelihoods depend on developing relationships that enable them to engage in profitable deals. This course emphasizes legal remedies, but the law may operate best when its values and community values are so closely aligned that relatively weak legal remedies are sufficient to motivate compliance.</p>

<p id="sec45" class="noindent">■ P<small>ARSONS</small>, C.J. in <span class="italic">Frye v. Hubbell</span>, 74 N.H. 358, 374 (1907):</p>
<p class="indent">One may be morally bound to do precisely in terms as he agrees; but he is legally bound to do, as a practical proposition, whatever the theory may be, only what he can be compelled by law to do. The common law does not compel men to do as they agree. It gives damages for the failure to perform legal or contractual duties, but except in a few instances only can the specific performance of the contract be enforced. If A owes B a promissory note, no form of action is known by which B can compel A to pay it when due. If A does not pay as promised, in an action of assumpsit B can recover damages because of the breach of A’s promise. Since the abolition of imprisonment for debt, the law does not take any steps to compel A to pay the damages. A’s property, if he has any subject to execution, the law will seize and apply on B’s damages. So that the most that A, who owes B a note, can be legally compelled to do is to suffer his property to be applied to pay B’s damages. As to permit this is all A can be compelled to do, it is all that he is legally bound to do. The law does not prohibit his breach of his contract, but leaves him free to break it if he chooses, giving the other party the remedy of damages. The damages the law awards for the non-payment of money is interest, and for the expense of obtaining judgment and execution costs. If costs always equal the expense of litigation, if interest is always full recompense for delayed payment, and if an execution is always equivalent to money in hand then a present part payment of a debt in cash is in fact never beneficial to the creditor or detrimental to the debtor, and can never be a consideration for a discharge of the balance. Whatever the conclusions of scholastic logic, as men having some acquaintance with affairs, judges are bound to know that none of these propositions are always, if ever true.</p>

<p id="sec48" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">White v. Benkowski</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Wisconsin Supreme Court, 1967.</p>
<p class="sectionb">37 Wis.2d 285, 155 N.W.2d 74.</p>
<p class="indent">This case involves a neighborhood squabble between two adjacent property owners.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to November 28, 1962, Virgil and Gwynneth White, the plaintiffs, were desirous of purchasing a home in Oak Creek. Unfortunately, the particular home that the Whites were interested in was without a water supply. Despite this fact, the Whites purchased the home.</p>
<p class="indent">The adjacent home was owned and occupied by Paul and Ruth Benkowski, the defendants. The Benkowskis had a well in their yard which had piping that connected with the Whites’ home.</p>
<p class="indent">On November 28, 1962, the Whites and Benkowskis entered into a written agreement wherein the Benkowskis promised to supply water to the White home for ten years or until an earlier date when either water was supplied by the municipality, the well became inadequate, or the Whites drilled their own well. The Whites promised to pay $3 a month for the water and one-half the cost of any future repairs or maintenance that the Benkowski well might require. As part of the transaction, but not included in the written agreement, the Whites gave the Benkowskis $400 which was used to purchase and install a new pump and an additional tank that would increase the capacity of the well.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, the relationship between the new neighbors was friendly. With the passing of time, however, their relationship deteriorated and the neighbors actually became hostile. In 1964, the water supply, which was controlled by the Benkowskis, was intermittently shut off. Mrs. White kept a record of the dates and durations that her water supply was not operative. Her record showed that the water was shut off on the following occasions:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) March 5, 1964, from 7:10 p.m. to 7:25 p.m.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) March 9, 1964, from 3:40 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) March 11, 1964, from 6:00 p.m. to 6:15 p.m.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) June 10, 1964, from 6:20 p.m. to 7:03 p.m.</p>
<p class="noindent">The record also discloses that the water was shut off completely or partially for varying lengths of time on July 1, 6, 7, and 17, 1964, and on November 25, 1964.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page92" class="pagebreak">92</div>
<p class="indent">Mr. Benkowski claimed that the water was shut off either to allow accumulated sand in the pipes to settle or to remind the Whites that their use of the water was excessive. Mr. White claimed that the Benkowskis breached their contract by shutting off the water.</p>
<p class="indent">Following the date when the water was last shut off (November 25, 1964), the Whites commenced an action to recover compensatory and punitive damages for an alleged violation of the agreement to supply water. A jury trial was held….</p>
<p class="indent">Before the case was submitted to the jury, the defendants moved to strike the verdict’s punitive-damage question. The court reserved its ruling on the motion. The jury returned a verdict which found that the Benkowskis maliciously shut off the Whites’ water supply for harassment purposes. Compensatory damages were set at $10 and punitive damages at $2,000. On motions after verdict, the court reduced the compensatory award to $1 and granted defendants’ motion to strike the punitive-damage question and answer.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ W<small>ILKIE</small>, J. Two issues are raised on this appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">1. Was the trial court correct in reducing the award of compensatory damages from $10 to $1?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Are punitive damages available in actions for breach of contract?</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">Reduction of Jury Award</span></p>
<p class="indentn">The evidence of damage adduced during the trial here was that the water supply had been shut off during several short periods. Three incidents of inconvenience resulting from these shut-offs were detailed by the plaintiffs. Mrs. White testified that the lack of water in the bathroom on one occasion caused an odor and that on two other occasions she was forced to take her children to a neighbor’s home to bathe them. Based on this evidence, the court instructed the jury that:</p>
<p class="blockquote">* * * in an action for a breach of contract the plaintiff is entitled to such damages as shall have been sustained by him which resulted naturally and directly from the breach if you find that the defendants did in fact breach the contract. Such damages include pecuniary loss and inconvenience suffered as a natural result of the breach and are called compensatory damages. In this case the plaintiffs have proved no pecuniary damages which you or the Court could compute. In a situation where there has been a breach of contract which you find to have damaged the plaintiff but for which the plaintiffs have proven no actual damages, the plaintiffs may recover nominal damages.</p>
<p class="indent">By nominal damages is meant trivial—a trivial sum of money.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page93" class="pagebreak">93</div>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs did not object to this instruction. In the trial court’s decision on motions after verdict it states that the court so instructed the jury because, based on the fact that the plaintiffs paid for services they did not receive, their loss in proportion to the contract rate was approximately 25 cents. This rationale indicates that the court disregarded or overlooked Mrs. White’s testimony of inconvenience. In viewing the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs, there was some injury. The plaintiffs are not required to ascertain their damages with mathematical precision, but rather the trier of fact must set damages at a reasonable amount. Notwithstanding this instruction, the jury set the plaintiffs’ damages at $10. The court was in error in reducing that amount to $1.</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">Punitive Damages</span></p>
<p class="indentn">“If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.”</p>
<p class="indent">Over one hundred years ago this court held that, under proper circumstances, a plaintiff was entitled to recover exemplary or punitive damages.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Kink v. Combs</span> is the most recent case in this state which deals with the practice of permitting punitive damages. In <span class="italic">Kink</span> the court relied on <span class="italic">Fuchs v. Kupper</span> and reaffirmed its adherence to the rule of punitive damages.</p>
<p class="indent">In Wisconsin compensatory damages are given to make whole the damage or injury suffered by the injured party. On the other hand, punitive damages are given</p>
<p class="blockquote">* * * on the basis of punishment to the injured party not because he has been injured, which injury has been compensated with compensatory damages, but to punish the wrongdoer for his malice and to deter others from like conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus we reach the question of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to punitive damages for a breach of the water agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">The overwhelming weight of authority supports the proposition that punitive damages are not recoverable in actions for breach of contract. In C<small>HITTY ON</small> C<small>ONTRACTS</small>, the author states that the right to receive punitive damages for breach of contract is now confined to the single case of damages for breach of a promise to marry.</p>
<p class="indent">Simpson states:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Although damages in excess of compensation for loss are in some instances permitted in tort actions by way of punishment * * * in contract actions the damages recoverable are limited to compensation for pecuniary loss sustained by the breach.</p>
<p class="noindent">Corbin states that as a general rule punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page94" class="pagebreak">94</div>
<p class="indent">In Wisconsin, the early case of <span class="italic">Gordon v. Brewster</span> involved the breach of an employment contract. The trial court instructed the jury that if the nonperformance of the contract was attributable to the defendant’s wrongful act of discharging the plaintiff, then that would go to increase the damages sustained. On appeal, this court said that the instruction was unfortunate and might have led the jurors to suppose that they could give something more than actual compensation in a breach of contract case. We find no Wisconsin case in which breach of contract (other than breach of promise to marry) has led to the award of punitive damages.</p>
<p class="indent">Persuasive authority from other jurisdictions supports the proposition (without exception) that punitive damages are not available in breach of contract actions. This is true even if the breach, as in the instant case, is willful.</p>
<p class="indent">Although it is well recognized that breach of a contractual duty may be a tort, in such situations the contract creates the relation out of which grows the duty to use care in the performance of a responsibility prescribed by the contract. Not so here. No tort was pleaded or proved.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversed in part by reinstating the jury verdict relating to compensatory damages and otherwise affirmed. Costs to appellant.</p>
<p id="sec49" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Wasn’t it a tort for the Benkowskis to maliciously turn off the Whites’ water? Did this case come out this way merely because the Whites’ lawyer drafted his pleadings incorrectly?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Apart from “the overwhelming weight of authority,” the Wisconsin Supreme Court doesn’t offer a persuasive explanation why contract damages are limited to “compensation.” Are the reasons that justify the rule so apparent that they need not be identified and discussed? Even if the Court were unwilling to punish breach by exemplary damages in general, why didn’t it consider treating a willful or malicious failure to perform differently from a failure despite a good faith try? Why not two sets of sanctions—a tough one for nasty, willful contract breakers and a softer one for those who innocently or negligently fail to perform?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. If a major purpose of providing official support to promises is to encourage reliance on them because they are important to the functioning of our network of relationships, why not simply impose heavy penalties on those who breach such promises?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The source of the Benkowskis’ legal obligation is their promise to the Whites, whereas the source of the obligation not to jaywalk or to park in certain places is a statute or regulation. Does the source of the obligation provide a basis for imposing different responses to failure? When we seek to bind ourselves specially through <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page95" class="pagebreak">95</span>promise, is the commitment less intense or less compelling than obedience to the general commands of government? We fine jaywalkers and parking violators. Are these more serious breaches of the peace than the Benkowskis maliciously cutting off the White family’s water?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. If Chisler orders goods from Victim and promises to pay for them although he does not intend to do so, he is guilty of a form of theft if he makes off with the goods. Same result if Chisler decides after delivery not to pay for the goods? If not, why not?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Behavior that breaches a contract may also be a crime, though it is not the contract breach that makes the behavior criminal. For example, if a trusted bookkeeper embezzles her employer’s funds, she is obviously in breach of her employment contract. She may also be subject to criminal prosecution, but not because she breached a contract. While this approach is an almost implicit assumption in our legal system, other legal systems treat certain breaches of promise as themselves criminal offenses. Consider § 422 of the Canadian Criminal Code:</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">C<small>RIMINAL</small> C<small>ODE</small>, R.S.C. § 422 (1985) (C<small>AN</small>.):</p>
<p class="blockquotei">(1) Every one who willfully breaks a contract, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the probable consequences of doing so, whether alone or in combination with others, will be</p>

<p class="blockquotei1">(c)    to expose valuable property, real or personal, to destruction or serious injury,</p>
<p class="blockquotei1">(d)    to deprive the inhabitants of a city or place, or part thereof, wholly or to a great extent, of their supply of light, power, gas or water, or</p>

<h3 id="sec50" class="section"><span class="bold">II.    S<small>PECIFIC</small> P<small>ERFORMANCE</small></span></h3>
<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">A legal system unwilling to impose criminal penalties or punitive damages for breach of promise nonetheless may be sufficiently committed to the concept of promise to require the breaching party to render the promised performance. Requiring the breaching party to perform specifically is the closest the law can come to giving the promisee precisely the performance purchased. If a deal is a deal, shouldn’t breaching parties be routinely ordered by the State to perform their part of the bargain? If they are not, it is natural to wonder why.</p>
<p class="indent">One objection to such a seemingly simple solution is that in most cases the exact performance that was bargained for cannot be rendered subsequent to breach, if only because performance later can never be the equivalent of performance at the earlier date specified in the contract. This difference, of course, might be compensated for by also ordering the breaching party to pay a sum of money to the nonbreaching party to compensate her for any loss suffered by the late performance. This, however, is likely to prove a clumsy way to handle a great many breaches. For example, when an undelivered performance can easily be procured by the nonbreaching party from some other source, as in the case of nondelivery of standard merchandise readily available elsewhere, there would seem to be little point in ordering performance by the breaching party. The simple solution in such a case is to compensate the nonbreaching party by awarding her a money judgment to cover whatever losses she suffers in the substitute purchase.</p>
<p class="indent">Another shortcoming of specific performance is that such an order may require subsequent court action to enforce it (a hearing or hearings leading to contempt citations), and thus is costly to employ. Many times a breach occurs because the breaching party is unable to perform and thus ordering him to perform is a futile gesture. Moreover, ordering a defendant to perform under threat of imprisonment implicates long-standing public policy against imprisonment for debt, or—in the case of contracts of employment—against forced labor.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page97" class="pagebreak">97</div>
<p class="indent">For these and other less logical reasons, Anglo–American jurisprudence has long held that specific performance is available only as an extraordinary remedy when the award of money damages would be “inadequate.”</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p id="sec51" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Northern Delaware Industrial Dev. Corp. v. E.W. Bliss Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Delaware Court of Chancery, 1968.</p>
<p class="sectionb">245 A.2d 431.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>ARVEL</small>, V<small>ICE</small> C<small>HANCELLOR</small>. Plaintiffs and defendant are parties to a contract dated May 26th, 1966, under the terms of which defendant agreed to furnish all labor, services, materials and equipment necessary to expand and modernize a steel fabricating plant owned by the plaintiff Phoenix Steel Corporation at Claymont, Delaware. A massive undertaking is called for in the contract, the total price for the work to be performed by the defendant being set in the contract at $27,500,000 and the area of contract performance extending over a plant site of approximately sixty acres.</p>
<p class="indent">Work on the project has not progressed as rapidly as contemplated in the contract and what plaintiffs now seek is an order compelling defendant to requisition 300 more workmen for a night shift, thus requiring defendant to put on the job, as it allegedly contracted to do, the number of men required to make up a full second shift at the Phoenix plant site during the period when one of the Phoenix mills must be shut down in order that its modernization may be carried out under the contract. And while the present record is sparse, there seems to be no doubt but that defendant has fallen behind the work completion schedules set forth in such contract. What plaintiffs apparently seek is a speeding up of work at the site by means of a court-ordered requisitioning by defendant of more laborers.</p>
<p class="indent">The basis for plaintiffs’ application for equitable relief is found in a work proposal made by defendant’s prime subcontractor, Noble J. Dick, Inc., to the Bliss Company, the terms of which are made part of the contract between plaintiffs and defendant. Such proposal stipulates inter alia:</p>
<p class="indents"><span class="bold">T. Working Schedule</span></p>
<p class="noindents">All work is quoted on a normal 40 hour basis—5 days per week except for necessary service tie-ins. The only additional premium time included is that required during the shut-down of #1 mill when two turn-week work is contemplated.</p>
<p class="indent">According to plaintiffs, the phrase “two turn-week work” is a term used in the steel industry to designate the employment of day and night shifts over a full seven day work week, and defendant does not deny this. Plaintiffs therefor reason that inasmuch as at or about the time of the filing of the complaint defendant was operating <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page98" class="pagebreak">98</span>one shift at the site ranging in size from 192 to 337 workers per day, whereas paragraph “T” above referred to contemplates two daily shifts, that they are entitled to a court order directing defendant to employ not less than 300 construction workers on each of two shifts, seven days per week. Plaintiffs seek other relief, including damages, but consideration of such other requested relief will be deferred for the present. Defendants earlier moved for dismissal or a stay because the parties are allegedly contractually bound to arbitrate their differences.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the sole matter now for decision is a question raised by the Court at argument on defendant’s motion, namely whether or not this Court should exercise its jurisdiction to grant plaintiffs’ application for an order for specific performance of an alleged contractual right to have more workers placed on the massive construction project here involved, and order the requisitioning of 300 workers<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_5" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> for a night shift, this being the number of laborers deemed by plaintiffs to be appropriate properly to bring about prompt completion of the job at hand.</p>
<p class="indent">On the basis of the record before me, viewed in the light of the applicable law, I am satisfied that this Court should not, as a result of granting plaintiffs’ prayer for specific performance of an alleged term of a building contract, become committed to supervising the carrying out of a massive, complex, and unfinished construction contract, a result which would necessarily follow as a consequence of ordering defendant to requisition laborers as prayed for. Parenthetically, it is noted that if such laborers are in fact available (which appears not to be the case), their presence at the Claymont site might well impede rather than advance the orderly completion of the steel mill renovation work now under way.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not that a court of equity is without jurisdiction in a proper case to order the completion of an expressly designed and largely completed construction project, particularly where the undertaking to construct is tied in with a contract for the sale of land and the construction in question is largely finished. Furthermore, this is not a case which calls for a building plan so precisely definite as to make compliance therewith subject to effective judicial supervision, but rather an attempt to have the Court as the result of ordering a builder to speed up general work by hiring a night shift of employees (a proposal which was merely “contemplated” by the subcontractor, Dick) to become deeply involved in supervision of a complex construction project located on plaintiffs’ property.</p>
<p class="indent">The point is that a court of equity should not order specific performance of any building contract in a situation in which it would be impractical to carry out such an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page99" class="pagebreak">99</span>order, unless there are special circumstances or the public interest is directly involved.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_6" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> In the case of <span class="italic">City Stores v. Ammerman</span> (D.C.D.C.) which plaintiffs cite to support their application, specific performance was sought of an agreement which contemplated that plaintiff would become a tenant in a designated section of a shopping center to be constructed by defendant. The plans for such center were quite definite and the court was obviously impressed by the fact that unless the relief sought were to be granted, plaintiff would lose out on a promised opportunity to share in the expected profits of a shopping center located in a burgeoning North Virginia suburb. The ruling while perhaps correct under the circumstances of the case has no application here.</p>
<p class="indent">I conclude that to grant specific performance, as prayed for by plaintiffs, would be inappropriate in view of the imprecision of the contract provision relied upon and the impracticability if not impossibility of effective enforcement by the Court of a mandatory order designed to keep a specific number of men on the job at the site of a steel mill which is undergoing extensive modernization and expansion. If plaintiffs have sustained loss as a result of actionable building delays on defendant’s part at the Phoenix plant at Claymont, they may, at an appropriate time, resort to law for a fixing of their claimed damages.</p>
<p class="indent">On notice, an application may be made for the entry of an order of dismissal of this action insofar as it seeks an order for specific performance of the Dick proposal “T”, or, in the alternative, for the removal of such cause of action to a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="sec52" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Isn’t an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure? Consider the effects of this $27.5 million project on the economy of Claymont, Delaware. Will damages be able to compensate for the losses that will be suffered by the steel company in lost sales, the workers in lost wages, and the entire community in lost wealth due to the delay in performance?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The traditional view is that an order for specific performance can only be justified if money damages fail to put the injured party in as good a position as he would have been had the contract been performed. So long as a court is able to identify a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page100" class="pagebreak">100</span>substitute in the market and to calculate, with some certainty, money damages on the basis of that substitute, money damages are considered adequate relief.</p>
<p class="indent">What matters in measuring money damages is the amount, refinement, and reliability of the available information about substitutes for the subject matter of the breached contract. “When the relevant information is thin and unreliable, there is a substantial risk that an award of money damages will either exceed or fall short of the promisee’s actual loss. Of course this risk can always be reduced—but only at great cost when reliable information is difficult to obtain. Conversely, when there is a great deal of consumer behavior generating abundant and highly dependable information about substitutes, the risk of error in measuring the promisee’s loss may be reduced at a much smaller cost. In asserting that the subject matter of a particular contract is unique and has no established market value, a court is really saying that it cannot obtain, at reasonable cost, enough information about substitutes to permit it to calculate an award of money damages without imposing an unacceptably high risk of undercompensation on the injured promisee. Conceived in this way, the uniqueness test seems economically sound.” Anthony T. Kronman, <span class="italic">Specific Performance</span>, 45 U. C<small>HI</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 351, 362 (1978).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The implications for economic efficiency of making specific performance more readily available are uncertain. A party entering a contract might pay the other side to limit recourse to specific performance in the event of breach. Or breaching promisors might “bribe” promisees to release them from specifically performing and thus incurring costs greater than the value of the promised performance to the promisee. This suggests that so long as applicable law allows parties to “contract around” equitable remedies, efficient allocation of resources will not be affected by the use of equitable over legal remedies. Consider on the other hand this Reporter’s Note to Chapter 16 (Remedies) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">…</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The important role that the institution of contract plays in the economy has drawn the attention of economists to the law of contract remedies. In classic economic theory the mechanism of exchange resulting from bargain is essential to the voluntary reallocation of goods, labor and other resources in a socially desirable manner. However, a party may err in calculating the net benefit to be expected from the performance of a bargain, or circumstances may so change as to disappoint his expectations. A contract that he once thought would be profitable may therefore become unprofitable for him. If the contract is still profitable for the other party, however, a question arises as to whether the reluctant party should be compelled to perform. The answer provided by at least some economic analysis tends to confirm the traditional response of common-law judges in dealing with this question.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page101" class="pagebreak">101</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The traditional goal of the law of contract remedies has not been compulsion of the promisor to perform his promise but compensation of the promisee for the loss resulting from breach. “Willful” breaches have not been distinguished from other breaches, punitive damages have not been awarded for breach of contract, and specific performance has not been granted where compensation in damages is an adequate substitute for the injured party. In general, therefore, a party may find it advantageous to refuse to perform a contract if he will still have a net gain after he has fully compensated the injured party for the resulting loss.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">This traditional response is not without its shortcomings. Its focus on the pecuniary aspects of breach fails to take account of notions of the sanctity of contract and the resulting moral obligation to honor one’s promises. The analysis of breach of contract in purely economic terms assumes an ability to measure value with a certainty that is not often possible in the judicial process. The analysis also ignores the “transaction costs” inherent in the bargaining process and in the resolution of disputes, a defect that is especially significant where the amount in controversy is small. However, the main thrust of the preceding economic analysis lends some support to traditional contract doctrine in this area.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Compare the appropriateness of an order of specific performance that requires that a contractor hire three hundred more workers with one that requires completion of the construction project on or before the date specified in the contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Supervision of a decree for specific performance of the construction project conceivably could entail an extensive and long-term involvement by the court and, in any event, management responsibilities beyond that required to execute a money judgment through a typical sheriff’s sale. Yet courts have for centuries been involved in the kind of long-term supervision which construction of the steel plant might require. Probating estates, supervising trusts, and administering bankruptcies can often be matters of great complexity, commitment and duration. Courts are so regularly involved in these matters that we notice nothing unusual if a court must oversee the operation of an airline, retail chain, or gambling casino.</p>
<p class="indent">Is the supervision of the construction of the steel plant pursuant to a decree for specific performance somehow illegitimate because of the absence of a complex statutory framework? Is the supervision of a construction project ill-advised because of the court’s lack of expertise? How much do courts know about running an airline or casino-hotel in bankruptcy proceedings or about the value and marketing of an art collection included in a large estate?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page102" class="pagebreak">102</div>
<p id="sec53" class="notes"><span class="bold">HISTORICAL NOTE: LAW AND EQUITY</span></p>
<p class="indent">Discussions of specific performance are likely to rely heavily on aphorisms sprinkled around the opinion which distinguish between “courts of equity” and “courts of law.” “Equity will not compel specific performance of an agreement to lend money” because a breach “can always be fully compensated by damages.” And “[t]he fact that a party can avail himself of a remedy in a court of law will not preclude him from obtaining relief in a court of equity….” One might ask who “equity” is and why does it have a court of its own where someone can obtain “relief” different from the “remedy” available in a court of law? Why does our legal system claim that money damages are the rule for contract cases and specific performance the exception, while most other legal systems in the world at least claim the opposite? (Be aware that whatever different legal systems claim, in most practical situations courts around the world tend to come out in about the same place.)</p>
<p class="indent">Many legal concepts simply make no sense without an appreciation of the historic experience out of which they grew. Law tends to be rationalistic in argument and format, but as Holmes taught, “the life of the law is not logic, but experience.” Times change, revolutions wash away institutions, but the old spirit often lives on in the new. Without some familiarity with the historical experience, you are doomed to remain forever puzzled by the law’s major features.</p>
<p class="indent">From the time of the great Roman lawyers onward, a distinction has been drawn between the substantive content of legal rules and the procedural rules that govern legal process. Most legal education for two millennia (including your own) has emphasized the conceptual structure of abstract substantive rules in isolation from, and in preference to, the grubby details of procedure. From either a practical or an historic perspective, however, the distinction is artificial and, if anything, it is procedure that determines substance, rather than the other way around. Justice Robert Jackson, the last U.S. Supreme Court Justice to learn law in a lawyer’s office rather than a law school, stated the historic truth when he observed that the substantive law often grows in the interstices of procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Specific performance is not a favored remedy at common law because historically this procedure was associated with a set of courts and political officials who competed for power with common law judges. To bring an action in one of the King’s Courts in England before the 19th century reforms, the plaintiff would have to obtain a writ from the Office of the Lord Chancellor, known as Chancery, by showing that the claim fell into the increasingly technical definitions of claims cognizable by a royal court. In medieval times the Lord Chancellor usually was a clerk, in both connotations of that term. He was a literate administrator, able to keep files and write documents in an age in which those skills were scarce. He possessed those skills because he was a cleric, a churchman, and frequently the King’s confessor. It <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page103" class="pagebreak">103</span>was the job of the Chancellor to decide whether cases fit in the conventional categories and occasionally to open a new category when circumstances required it. The motivation to open new categories of claims was not merely administrative. As the King’s confessor, the keeper of the royal conscience, the Chancellor was open to claims of right based on the King’s obligation to do justice. When the remedies of the law failed to provide justice, the Chancellor would do equity and provide relief.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chancellor’s Court or “the court of equity” started as an interstitial forum limited to hearing “suits in equity” when “the legal remedy” (that is, the remedy provided by the common law courts) was inadequate. The Chancellor’s view of what he could do and why he could do it was more open-ended than that of the judges sitting as common law courts. Chancellor’s courts were heavily influenced by canon law and, like Church courts, ordered defendants to act personally for the good of their souls. Equitable decrees directed a defendant to do or not to do something. A disobedient defendant could be fined and imprisoned for contempt.</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, the common law courts seldom ordered the defendant to do anything. The King’s central interests were land and military order in the countryside. A common law judgment characteristically declared that the plaintiff recover from the defendant a sum of money. If a judgment debtor did not pay voluntarily, his real and personal property were subject to seizure and sale by the sheriff, who began as the King’s resident military officer in the county. If no assets could be identified and seized, the common law court could do no more—the judgment went unsatisfied. The commands issued by the common law court thus typically were addressed to royal officers to execute against the defendant’s property, not directly to defendants.</p>
<p class="indent">During the Tudor and Stuart revolutions of the 16th and 17th centuries, the medieval order was replaced by an increasingly centralized national state. The limiting jurisdictional concepts of the common law proved a constraint not only on judges but upon kings. The Crown and its bureaucratic servants became stronger and eventually claimed the right to rule absolutely without the restraints of law and its cumbersome procedures. In time, the law and professional lawyers became a major political group opposing this new royal power. Judges and Chancellors competed for power, and the common law and equity each insisted on its primacy. In the end, King James I determined that the Chancellor would prevail if his jurisdiction were properly invoked, but that first recourse must be to the common law. Equity would not act in cases properly cognizable at law; if damages provided an adequate remedy, the Chancellor would not intervene.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 19th century the separate court systems of law and equity were abolished along with the forms of action in England and most American states. Delaware maintains one of the few separate equity courts in the nation. Elsewhere, there is one court of general jurisdiction in all civil cases. But lawyers’ habits die hard when they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page104" class="pagebreak">104</span>have the weight of so many generations behind them. On any given Monday morning in most large cities, one is likely to discover that some of the judges sitting in the courthouse are hearing “legal motions,” while others preside over a separate “writs and receivers’ department” or a courtroom with some other arcane title where equitable relief is granted. Moreover, the forms of action may be dead, but you are likely to learn when you enter practice to separate your contract claims from those sounding in tort, to keep the basic contract claim (special assumpsit) separate from the “common counts,” and otherwise imitate in practice distinctions the law claims to have abandoned long before your great grandfather was born.</p>
<p class="indent">The very mention of specific performance triggers in the minds of judges and lawyers alike special labels, special rules, and even special feelings. To some degree, this response simply reflects the continued state of the law. Both the Second Restatement and the Uniform Commercial Code preserve the remedial hierarchy and measure requests for specific performance by standards that, by and large, were first developed in the English courts of equity. While the drafters desired to foster “a more liberal attitude” (UCC § 2–716, Comment 1), they preserved the old bottom line: Specific performance shall be granted only if legal remedies fail in their purpose.</p>

<p id="sec54" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">American Broadcasting Companies v. Wolf</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1981.</p>
<p class="sectionb">52 N.Y.2d 394, 438 N.Y.S.2d 482, 420 N.E.2d 363.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ C<small>OOKE</small>, C.J. This case provides an interesting insight into the fierce competition in the television industry for popular performers and favorable ratings. It requires legal resolution of a rather novel employment imbroglio.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue is whether plaintiff American Broadcasting Companies, Incorporated (ABC), is entitled to equitable relief against defendant Warner Wolf, a New York City sportscaster, because of Wolf’s breach of a good faith negotiation provision of a now expired broadcasting contract with ABC. In the present circumstances, it is concluded that the equitable relief sought by plaintiff—which would have the effect of forcing Wolf off the air—may not be granted.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Warner Wolf, a sportscaster who has developed a rather colorful and unique on-the-air personality, had been employed by ABC since 1976. In February, 1978, ABC and Wolf entered into an employment agreement which, following exercise of renewal option, was to terminate on March 5, 1980. The contract contained a clause, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page105" class="pagebreak">105</span>known as a good-faith negotiation and first-refusal provision, that is at the crux of this litigation:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">You agree, if we so elect, during the last ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the extended term of this agreement, to enter into good faith negotiations with us for the extension of this agreement on mutually agreeable terms. You further agree that for the first forty-five (45) days of this renegotiation period, you will not negotiate for your services with any other person or company other than WABC–TV or ABC. In the event we are unable to reach an agreement for an extension by the expiration of the extended term hereof, you agree that you will not accept, in any market for a period of three (3) months following expiration of the extended term of this agreement, any offer of employment as a sportscaster, sports news reporter, commentator, program host, or analyst in broadcasting (including television, cable television, pay television and radio) without first giving us, in writing, an opportunity to employ you on substantially similar terms and you agree to enter into an agreement with us on such terms.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under this provision, Wolf was bound to negotiate in good faith with ABC for the 90–day period from December 6, 1979 through March 4, 1980. For the first 45 days, December 6 through January 19, the negotiation with ABC was to be exclusive. Following expiration of the 90–day negotiating period and the contract on March 5, 1980, Wolf was required, before <span class="italic">accepting</span> any other offer, to afford ABC a right of first refusal; he could comply with this provision either by refraining from accepting another offer or by first tendering the offer to ABC. The first-refusal period expired on June 3, 1980 and on June 4 Wolf was free to accept any job opportunity, without obligation to ABC.</p>
<p class="indent">Wolf first met with ABC executives in September, 1979 to discuss the terms of a renewal contract. Counterproposals were exchanged, and the parties agreed to finalize the matter by October 15. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to ABC, Wolf met with representatives of CBS in early October. Wolf related his employment requirements and also discussed the first refusal-good faith negotiation clause of his ABC contract. Wolf furnished CBS a copy of that portion of the ABC agreement. On October 12, ABC officials and Wolf met, but were unable to reach agreement on a renewal contract. A few days later, on October 16 Wolf again discussed employment possibilities with CBS.</p>
<p class="indent">Not until January 2, 1980 did ABC again contact Wolf. At that time, ABC expressed its willingness to meet substantially all of his demands. Wolf rejected the offer, however, citing ABC’s delay in communicating with him and his desire to explore his options in light of the impending expiration of the 45–day exclusive negotiation period.</p>
<p class="indent">On February 1, 1980, after termination of that exclusive period, Wolf and CBS orally agreed on the terms of Wolf’s employment as sportscaster for WCBS–TV, a CBS-owned affiliate in New York. During the next two days, CBS informed Wolf that it had prepared two agreements and divided his annual compensation between <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page106" class="pagebreak">106</span>the two: one covered his services as an on-the-air sportscaster, and the other was an off-the-air production agreement for sports specials Wolf was to produce. The production agreement contained an exclusivity clause which barred Wolf from performing “services of any nature for” or permitting the use of his “name, likeness, voice or endorsement by, any person, firm or corporation” during the term of the agreement, unless CBS consented. The contract had an effective date of March 6, 1980.</p>
<p class="indent">Wolf signed the CBS production agreement on February 4, 1980. At the same time, CBS agreed in writing, in consideration of $100 received from Wolf, to hold open an offer of employment to Wolf as sportscaster until June 4, 1980, the date on which Wolf became free from ABC’s right of first refusal. The next day, February 5, Wolf submitted a letter of resignation to ABC.</p>
<p class="indent">Representatives of ABC met with Wolf on February 6 and made various offers and promises that Wolf rejected. Wolf informed ABC that they had delayed negotiations with him and downgraded his worth. He stated he had no future with the company. He told the officials he had made a “gentlemen’s agreement” and would leave ABC on March 5. Later in February, Wolf and ABC agreed that Wolf would continue to appear on the air during a portion of the first-refusal period, from March 6 until May 28.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_7" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">ABC commenced this action on May 6, 1980, by which time Wolf’s move to CBS had become public knowledge. The complaint alleged that Wolf, induced by CBS breached both the good-faith negotiation and first-refusal provisions of his contract with ABC. ABC sought specific enforcement of its right of first refusal and an injunction against Wolf’s employment as a sportscaster with CBS.</p>
<p class="indent">After a trial, Supreme Court found no breach of the contract, and went on to note that, in any event, equitable relief would be inappropriate. A divided Appellate Division, while concluding that Wolf had breached both the good-faith negotiation and first-refusal provisions, nonetheless affirmed on the ground that equitable intervention was unwarranted. There should be an affirmance.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Initially, we agree with the Appellate Division that defendant Wolf breached his obligation to negotiate in good faith with ABC from December, 1979 through March, 1980. When Wolf signed the production agreement with CBS on February 4, 1980, he obligated himself not to render services “of any nature” to any person, firm or corporation on and after March 6, 1980. Quite simply, then, beginning on February <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page107" class="pagebreak">107</span>4 Wolf was unable to extend his contract with ABC; his contract with CBS precluded him from legally serving ABC in any capacity after March 5. Given Wolf’s existing obligation to CBS, any negotiations he engaged in with ABC, without the consent of CBS, after February 4 were meaningless and could not have been in good faith.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, there is no basis in the record for the Appellate Division’s conclusion that Wolf violated the first-refusal provision by entering into an oral sportscasting contract with CBS on February 4. The first-refusal provision required Wolf, for a period of 90 days after termination of the ABC agreement, either to refrain from accepting an offer of employment or to first submit the offer to ABC for its consideration. By its own terms, the right of first refusal did not apply to offers accepted by Wolf prior to the March 5 termination of the ABC employment contract. It is apparent, therefore, that Wolf could not have breached the right of first refusal by accepting an offer during the term of his employment with ABC. Rather, his conduct violates only the good-faith negotiation clause of the contract. The question is whether this breach entitled ABC to injunctive relief that would bar Wolf from continued employment at CBS. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to trace the principles of specific performance applicable to personal service contracts.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III</span></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">-A-</span></p>
<p class="indent">Courts of equity historically have refused to order an individual to perform a contract for personal services. Originally this rule evolved because of the inherent difficulties courts would encounter in supervising the performance of uniquely personal efforts.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_8" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> During the Civil War era, there emerged a more compelling reason for not directing the performance of personal services: the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of involuntary servitude. It has been strongly suggested that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page108" class="pagebreak">108</span>judicial compulsion of services would violate the express command of that amendment. For practical, policy and constitutional reasons, therefore, courts continue to decline to affirmatively enforce employment contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the years, however, in certain narrowly tailored situations, the law fashioned other remedies for failure to perform an employment agreement. Thus, where an employee refuses to render services to an employer in violation of an existing contract, and the services are unique or extraordinary, an injunction may issue to prevent the employee from furnishing those services to another person for the duration of the contract. Such “negative enforcement” was initially available only when the employee had expressly stipulated not to compete with the employer for the term of the engagement. Later cases permitted injunctive relief where the circumstances justified implication of a negative covenant. In these situations, an injunction is warranted because the employee either expressly or by clear implication agreed not to work elsewhere for the period of his contract. And, since the services must be unique before negative enforcement will be granted, irreparable harm will befall the employer should the employee be permitted to labor for a competitor.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">-B-</span></p>
<p class="indent">After a personal service contract terminates, the availability of equitable relief against the former employee diminishes appreciably. Since the period of service has expired, it is impossible to decree affirmative or negative specific performance. Only if the employee has expressly agreed not to compete with the employer following the term of the contract, or is threatening to disclose trade secrets or commit another tortious act, is injunctive relief generally available at the behest of the employer. Even where there is an express anticompetitive covenant, however, it will be rigorously examined and specifically enforced only if it satisfies certain established requirements. Indeed, a court normally will not decree specific enforcement of an employee’s anticompetitive covenant unless necessary to protect the trade secrets, customer lists or good will of the employer’s business, or perhaps when the employer is exposed to special harm because of the unique nature of the employee’s services.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_9" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-9" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></sup> And, an otherwise valid covenant will not be enforced if it is unreasonable in time, space or scope or would operate in a harsh or oppressive manner. There is, in short, general judicial disfavor of anticompetitive covenants contained in employment contracts.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page109" class="pagebreak">109</div>
<p class="indent">Underlying the strict approach to enforcement of these covenants is the notion that, once the term of an employment agreement has expired, the general public policy favoring robust and uninhibited competition should not give way merely because a particular employer wishes to insulate himself from competition. Important, too, are the “powerful considerations of public policy which militate against sanctioning the loss of a man’s livelihood.” At the same time, the employer is entitled to protection from unfair or illegal conduct that causes economic injury. The rules governing enforcement of anticompetitive covenants and the availability of equitable relief after termination of employment are designed to foster these interests of the employer without impairing the employee’s ability to earn a living or the general competitive mold of society.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">-C-</span></p>
<p class="indent">Specific enforcement of personal service contracts thus turns initially upon whether the term of employment has expired. If the employee refuses to perform during the period of employment, was furnishing unique services, has expressly or by clear implication agreed not to compete for the duration of the contract and the employer is exposed to irreparable injury, it may be appropriate to restrain the employee from competing until the agreement expires. Once the employment contract has terminated, by contrast, equitable relief is potentially available only to prevent injury from unfair competition or similar tortious behavior or to enforce an express and valid anticompetitive covenant. In the absence of such circumstances, the general policy of unfettered competition should prevail.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">Applying these principles, it is apparent that ABC’s request for injunctive relief must fail. There is no existing employment agreement between the parties; the original contract terminated in March, 1980. Thus, the negative enforcement that might be appropriate during the term of employment is unwarranted here. Nor is there an express anticompetitive covenant that defendant Wolf is violating, or any claim of special injury from tortious conduct such as exploitation of trade secrets. In short, ABC seeks to premise equitable relief after termination of the employment upon a simple, albeit serious, breach of a general contract negotiation clause. To grant an injunction in that situation would be to unduly interfere with an individual’s livelihood and to inhibit free competition where there is no corresponding injury to the employer other than the loss of a competitive edge. Indeed, if relief were granted here, any breach of an employment contract provision relating to renewal negotiations logically would serve as the basis for an open-ended restraint upon the employee’s ability to earn a living should he ultimately choose not to extend his employment. Our public policy, which favors the free exchange of goods and services through established market mechanisms, dictates otherwise.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page110" class="pagebreak">110</div>
<p class="indent">Equally unavailing is ABC’s request that the court create a noncompetitive covenant by implication. Although in a proper case an implied-in-fact covenant not to compete for the term of employment may be found to exist, anticompetitive covenants covering the postemployment period will not be implied.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_10" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-10" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup> Indeed, even an express covenant will be scrutinized and enforced only in accordance with established principles.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that ABC has not been damaged in some fashion or that Wolf should escape responsibility for the breach of his good-faith negotiation obligation. Rather, we merely conclude that ABC is not entitled to equitable relief. Because of the unique circumstances presented, however, this decision is without prejudice to ABC’s right to pursue relief in the form of monetary damages, if it be so advised.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ F<small>UCHSBERG</small>, J. (dissenting).</p>
<p class="indent">I agree with all the members of this court, as had all the Justices at the Appellate Division, that the defendant Wolf breached his undisputed obligation to negotiate in good faith for renewal of his contract with ABC. Where we part company is in the majority’s unwillingness to mold an equitable decree, even one more limited than the harsh one the plaintiff proposed, to right the wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">Central to the disposition of this case is the first-refusal provision. Its terms are worth recounting. They plainly provide that, in the 90–day period immediately succeeding the termination of his ABC contract, before Wolf could accept a position as sportscaster with another company, he first had to afford ABC the opportunity to engage him on like terms. True, he was not required to entertain offers, whether from ABC or anyone else, during that period. In that event he, of course, would be off the air for that 90 days, during which ABC could attempt to orient its listeners from Wolf to his successor. On the other hand, if Wolf wished to continue to broadcast actively during the 90 days, ABC’s right of first refusal put it in a position to make sure that Wolf was not doing so for a competitor. One way or the other, however labeled, the total effect of the first refusal agreement was that of an express conditional covenant under which Wolf could be restricted from appearing on the air other than for ABC for the 90–day posttermination period.</p>
<p class="indent">One need not be in the broadcasting business to understand that the restriction ABC bargained for, and Wolf granted, when they entered into the original employment contract was not inconsequential. The earnings of broadcasting companies are directly related to the “ratings” they receive. This, in turn, is at least in part dependent on the popularity of personalities like Wolf. It therefore was to ABC’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page111" class="pagebreak">111</span>advantage, once Wolf came into its employ, especially since he was new to the New York market, that it enhance his popularity by featuring, advertising and otherwise promoting him. This meant that the loyalty of at least part of the station’s listening audience would become identified with Wolf, thus enhancing his potential value to competitors, as witness the fact that, in place of the $250,000 he was receiving during his last year with ABC, he was able to command $400,000 to $450,000 per annum in his CBS “deal.” A reasonable opportunity during which ABC could cope with such an assault on its good will had to be behind the clause in question.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, it is undisputed that, when in late February Wolf executed the contract for an extension of employment during the 90–day hiatus for which the parties had bargained, ABC had every right to expect that Wolf had not already committed himself to an exclusivity provision in a producer’s contract with CBS in violation of the good-faith negotiation clause. Surely, had ABC been aware of this gross breach, had it not been duped into giving an uninformed consent, it would not have agreed to serve as a self-destructive vehicle for the further enhancement of Wolf’s potential for taking his ABC-earned following with him.</p>
<p class="indent">In the face of these considerations, the majority rationalizes its position of powerlessness to grant equitable relief by choosing to interpret the contract as though there were no restrictive covenant, express or implied. However, as demonstrated, there is, in fact, an express three-month negative covenant which, because of Wolf’s misconduct, ABC was effectively denied the opportunity to exercise. Enforcement of this covenant, by enjoining Wolf from broadcasting for a three-month period, would depart from no entrenched legal precedent. Rather, it would accord with equity’s boasted flexibility.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Should ABC take up the Court of Appeals on its invitation to seek monetary damages? What sort of damages will it be able to prove?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. While many American jurisdictions, like New York, will enforce covenants not to compete in employment contracts that are limited in time and scope in at least some circumstances, <span class="italic">see also</span> Restatement (Second) § 186, some states, notably California, do not. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP</span>, 189 P.3d 285 (Cal. 2008). California courts invalidate such covenants in light of California’s public policy favoring open competition and trade. <span class="italic">See Hill Med. Corp. v. Wycoff</span>, 103 Cal. Rptr. 2d 779 (Ct. App. 2001). Some commentators have linked the economic vitality of California’s Silicon Valley to non-enforcement of covenants not to compete, noting that the California rule facilitates the movement of talent and dissemination of knowledge from established firms to start-ups and competitors, encouraging innovation. Ronald Gilson, <span class="italic">The Legal Infrastructure of High Technology Industrial Districts:</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page112" class="pagebreak">112</span><span class="italic">Silicon Valley, Route 128, and Covenants Not to Compete</span>, 74 N.Y.U.

<p class="indent">The decision below illustrates a modern trend to more liberally award specific performance to remedy certain contract breaches. Even though these cases proclaim a greater receptivity toward specific performance, the judges who write these opinions, like the lawyers who practice before them and the drafters of the Restatement and the UCC, think in terms of the remedial hierarchy established by the Chancery courts and even criticize its effects by presupposing that it is correct.</p>
<p id="sec56" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Property Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1992.</p>
<p class="sectionb">966 F.2d 273.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>OSNER</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indentn">This appeal from the grant of a permanent injunction raises fundamental issues concerning the propriety of injunctive relief. The essential facts are simple. Walgreen has operated a pharmacy in the Southgate Mall in Milwaukee since its opening in 1951. Its current lease, signed in 1971 and carrying a 30-year, 6-month term, contains, as had the only previous lease, a clause in which the landlord, Sara Creek, promises not to lease space in the mall to anyone else who wants to operate a pharmacy or a store containing a pharmacy.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1990, fearful that its largest tenant—what in real estate parlance is called the “anchor tenant”—having gone broke was about to close its store, Sara Creek informed Walgreen that it intended to buy out the anchor tenant and install in its place a discount store operated by Phar-Mor Corporation, a “deep discount” chain, rather than, like Walgreen, just a “discount” chain. Phar-Mor’s store would occupy 100,000 square feet, of which 12,000 would be occupied by a pharmacy the same size as Walgreen’s. The entrances to the two stores would be within a couple of hundred feet of each other.</p>
<p class="indent">Walgreen filed this diversity suit for breach of contract against Sara Creek and Phar-Mor and asked for an injunction against Sara Creek’s letting the anchor premises to Phar-Mor. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge found a breach of Walgreen’s lease and entered a permanent injunction against Sara Creek’s letting the anchor tenant premises to Phar-Mor until the expiration of Walgreen’s lease. He did this over the defendants’ objection that Walgreen had failed to show that its <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page113" class="pagebreak">113</span>remedy at law—damages—for the breach of the exclusivity clause was inadequate. Sara Creek had put on an expert witness who testified that Walgreen’s damages could be readily estimated, and Walgreen had countered with evidence from its employees that its damages would be very difficult to compute, among other reasons because they included intangibles such as loss of goodwill.</p>
<p class="indent">Sara Creek reminds us that damages are the norm in breach of contract as in other cases. Many breaches, it points out, are “efficient” in the sense that they allow resources to be moved into a more valuable use. Perhaps this is one—the value of Phar-Mor’s occupancy of the anchor premises may exceed the cost to Walgreen of facing increased competition. If so, society will be better off if Walgreen is paid its damages, equal to that cost, and Phar-Mor is allowed to move in rather than being kept out by an injunction. That is why injunctions are not granted as a matter of course, but only when the plaintiff’s damages remedy is inadequate. Walgreen’s is not, Sara Creek argues; the projection of business losses due to increased competition is a routine exercise in calculation. Damages representing either the present value of lost future profits or (what should be the equivalent) the diminution in the value of the leasehold have either been awarded or deemed the proper remedy in a number of reported cases for breach of an exclusivity clause in a shopping-center lease. Why, Sara Creek asks, should they not be adequate here?</p>
<p class="indent">Sara Creek makes a beguiling argument that contains much truth, but we do not think it should carry the day. For if, as just noted, damages have been awarded in some cases of breach of an exclusivity clause in a shopping-center lease, injunctions have been issued in others. The choice between remedies requires a balancing of the costs and benefits of the alternatives. The task of striking the balance is for the trial judge, subject to deferential appellate review in recognition of its particularistic, judgmental, fact-bound character. As we said in an appeal from a grant of a preliminary injunction—but the point is applicable to review of a permanent injunction as well—“The question for us [appellate judges] is whether the [district] judge exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances, not what we would have done if we had been in his shoes.” <span class="italic">Roland Machinery Co. v. Dresser Industries, Inc.,</span> 749 F.2d 380, 390 (7th Cir.1984).</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff who seeks an injunction has the burden of persuasion—damages are the norm, so the plaintiff must show why his case is abnormal. But when, as in this case, the issue is whether to grant a permanent injunction, not whether to grant a temporary one, the burden is to show that damages are inadequate, not that the denial of the injunction will work irreparable harm. “Irreparable” in the injunction context means not rectifiable by the entry of a final judgment. It has nothing to do with whether to grant a permanent injunction, which, in the usual case anyway, <span class="italic">is</span> the final judgment. The use of “irreparable harm” or “irreparable injury” as synonyms for inadequate remedy at law is a confusing usage. It should be avoided.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page114" class="pagebreak">114</div>
<p class="indent">The benefits of substituting an injunction for damages are twofold. First, it shifts the burden of determining the cost of the defendant’s conduct from the court to the parties. If it is true that Walgreen’s damages are smaller than the gain to Sara Creek from allowing a second pharmacy into the shopping mall, then there must be a price for dissolving the injunction that will make both parties better off. Thus, the effect of upholding the injunction would be to substitute for the costly processes of forensic fact determination the less costly processes of private negotiation. Second, a premise of our free-market system, and the lesson of experience here and abroad as well, is that prices and costs are more accurately determined by the market than by government. A battle of experts is a less reliable method of determining the actual cost to Walgreen of facing new competition than negotiations between Walgreen and Sara Creek over the price at which Walgreen would feel adequately compensated for having to face that competition.</p>
<p class="indent">That is the benefit side of injunctive relief but there is a cost side as well. Many injunctions require continuing supervision by the court, and that is costly. A request for specific performance (a form of mandatory injunction) of a franchise agreement was refused on this ground in <span class="italic">North American Financial Group, Ltd. v. S.M.R. Enterprises, Inc.</span>; see Edward Yorio, <span class="italic">Contract Enforcement: Specific Performance and Injunctions</span> § 3.3.2 (1989). This ground was also stressed in <span class="italic">Rental Development Corp. v. Lavery</span>, a case involving a lease. Some injunctions are problematic because they impose costs on third parties. A more subtle cost of injunctive relief arises from the situation that economists call “bilateral monopoly,” in which two parties can deal only with each other: the situation that an injunction creates. The sole seller of widgets selling to the sole buyer of that product would be an example. But so will be the situation confronting Walgreen and Sara Creek if the injunction is upheld. Walgreen can “sell” its injunctive right only to Sara Creek, and Sara Creek can “buy” Walgreen’s surrender of its right to enjoin the leasing of the anchor tenant’s space to Phar-Mor only from Walgreen. The lack of alternatives in bilateral monopoly creates a bargaining range, and the costs of negotiating to a point within that range may be high. Suppose the cost to Walgreen of facing the competition of Phar-Mor at the Southgate Mall would be $1 million, and the benefit to Sara Creek of leasing to Phar-Mor would be $2 million. Then at any price between those figures for a waiver of Walgreen’s injunctive right both parties would be better off, and we expect parties to bargain around a judicial assignment of legal rights if the assignment is inefficient. R.H. Coase, <span class="italic">The Problem of Social Cost</span>, 3 J. Law &amp; Econ. 1 (1960). But each of the parties would like to engross as much of the bargaining range as possible—Walgreen to press the price toward $2 million, Sara Creek to depress it toward $1 million. With so much at stake, both parties will have an incentive to devote substantial resources of time and money to the negotiation process. The process may even break <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page115" class="pagebreak">115</span>down, if one or both parties want to create for future use a reputation as a hard bargainer; and if it does break down, the injunction will have brought about an inefficient result. All these are in one form or another costs of the injunctive process that can be avoided by substituting damages.</p>
<p class="indent">The costs and benefits of the damages remedy are the mirror of those of the injunctive remedy. The damages remedy avoids the cost of continuing supervision and third-party effects, and the cost of bilateral monopoly as well. It imposes costs of its own, however, in the form of diminished accuracy in the determination of value, on the one hand, and of the parties’ expenditures on preparing and presenting evidence of damages, and the time of the court in evaluating the evidence, on the other.</p>
<p class="indent">The weighing up of all these costs and benefits is the analytical procedure that is or at least should be employed by a judge asked to enter a permanent injunction, with the understanding that if the balance is even the injunction should be withheld. The judge is not required to explicate every detail of the analysis and he did not do so here, but as long we are satisfied that his approach is broadly consistent with a proper analysis we shall affirm; and we are satisfied here. The determination of Walgreen’s damages would have been costly in forensic resources and inescapably inaccurate. The lease had ten years to run. So Walgreen would have had to project its sales revenues and costs over the next ten years, and then project the impact on those figures of Phar-Mor’s competition, and then discount that impact to present value. All but the last step would have been fraught with uncertainty.</p>
<p class="indent">We may have given too little weight to such uncertainties in <span class="italic">American Dairy Queen Corp. v. Brown-Port Co.,</span> but in that case the district judge had found that the remedy at law was adequate in the circumstances and the movant had failed to make its best argument for inadequacy in the district court. It is difficult to forecast the profitability of a retail store over a decade, let alone to assess the impact of a particular competitor on that profitability over that period. Of course one can hire an expert to make such predictions, Glen A. Stankee, <span class="italic">Econometric Forecasting of Lost Profits: Using High Technology to Compute Commercial Damages</span>, 61 Fla.B.J. 83 (1987), and if injunctive relief is infeasible the expert’s testimony may provide a tolerable basis for an award of damages. We cited cases in which damages have been awarded for the breach of an exclusivity clause in a shopping-center lease. But they are awarded in such circumstances not because anyone thinks them a clairvoyant forecast but because it is better to give a wronged person a crude remedy than none at all. It is the same theory on which damages are awarded for a disfiguring injury. No one thinks such injuries readily monetizable, but a crude estimate is better than letting the wrongdoer get off scot-free (which, not incidentally, would encourage more such injuries). Sara Creek presented evidence of what happened (very little) to Walgreen when Phar-Mor moved into other shopping malls in which Walgreen has <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page116" class="pagebreak">116</span>a pharmacy, and it was on the right track in putting in comparative evidence. But there was a serious question whether the other malls were actually comparable to the Southgate Mall, so we cannot conclude, in the face of the district judge’s contrary conclusion, that the existence of comparative evidence dissolved the difficulties of computing damages in this case. Sara Creek complains that the judge refused to compel Walgreen to produce all the data that Sara Creek needed to demonstrate the feasibility of forecasting Walgreen’s damages. Walgreen resisted, on grounds of the confidentiality of the data and the cost of producing the massive data that Sara Creek sought. Those are legitimate grounds; and the cost (broadly conceived) they expose of pretrial discovery, in turn presaging complexity at trial, is itself a cost of the damages remedy that injunctive relief saves.</p>
<p class="indent">Damages are not always costly to compute, or difficult to compute accurately. In the standard case of a seller’s breach of a contract for the sale of goods where the buyer covers by purchasing the same product in the market, damages are readily calculable by subtracting the contract price from the market price and multiplying by the quantity specified in the contract. But this is not such a case and here damages would be a costly and inaccurate remedy; and on the other side of the balance some of the costs of an injunction are absent and the cost that is present seems low. The injunction here, like one enforcing a covenant not to compete (standardly enforced by injunction), is a simple negative injunction—Sara Creek is not to lease space in the Southgate Mall to Phar-Mor during the term of Walgreen’s lease—and the costs of judicial supervision and enforcement should be negligible. There is no contention that the injunction will harm an <span class="italic">unrepresented</span> third party. It may harm Phar-Mor but that harm will be reflected in Sara Creek’s offer to Walgreen to dissolve the injunction. (Anyway Phar-Mor <span class="italic">is</span> a party.) The injunction may also, it is true, harm potential customers of Phar-Mor—people who would prefer to shop at a deep-discount store than an ordinary discount store—but their preferences, too, are registered indirectly. The more business Phar-Mor would have, the more rent it will be willing to pay Sara Creek, and therefore the more Sara Creek will be willing to pay Walgreen to dissolve the injunction.</p>
<p class="indent">The only substantial cost of the injunction in this case is that it may set off a round of negotiations between the parties. In some cases, illustrated by <span class="italic">Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.</span>, this consideration alone would be enough to warrant the denial of injunctive relief. The defendant’s factory was emitting cement dust that caused the plaintiffs harm monetized at less than $200,000, and the only way to abate the harm would have been to close down the factory, which had cost $45 million to build. An injunction against the nuisance could therefore have created a huge bargaining range (could, not would, because it is unclear what the current value of the factory was), and the costs of negotiating to a point within it might have been immense. If the market value of the factory was actually $45 million, the plaintiffs <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page117" class="pagebreak">117</span>would be tempted to hold out for a price to dissolve the injunction in the tens of millions and the factory would be tempted to refuse to pay anything more than a few hundred thousand dollars. Negotiations would be unlikely to break down completely, given such a bargaining range, but they might well be protracted and costly. There is nothing so dramatic here. Sara Creek does not argue that it will have to close the mall if enjoined from leasing to Phar-Mor. Phar-Mor is not the only potential anchor tenant. <span class="italic">Liza Danielle, Inc. v. Jamko, Inc.</span>, on which Sara Creek relies, presented the converse case where the grant of the injunction would have forced an existing tenant to close its store.</p>
<p class="indent">To summarize, the judge did not exceed the bounds of reasonable judgment in concluding that the costs (including forgone benefits) of the damages remedy would exceed the costs (including forgone benefits) of an injunction. We need not consider whether, as intimated by Walgreen, exclusivity clauses in shopping-center leases should be considered presumptively enforceable by injunctions. Although we have described the choice between legal and equitable remedies as one for case-by-case determination, the courts have sometimes picked out categories of cases in which injunctive relief is made the norm. The best-known example is specific performance of contracts for the sale of real property. Anthony T. Kronman, <span class="italic">Specific Performance</span>, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 351, 355 and n. 20 (1978). The rule that specific performance will be ordered in such cases as a matter of course is a generalization of the considerations discussed above. Because of the absence of a fully liquid market in real property and the frequent presence of subjective values (many a homeowner, for example, would not sell his house for its market value), the calculation of damages is difficult; and since an order of specific performance to convey a piece of property does not create a continuing relation between the parties, the costs of supervision and enforcement if specific performance is ordered are slight. The exclusivity clause in Walgreen’s lease relates to real estate, but we hesitate to suggest that every contract involving real estate should be enforceable as a matter of course by injunctions. Suppose Sara Creek had covenanted to keep the entrance to Walgreen’s store free of ice and snow, and breached the covenant. An injunction would require continuing supervision, and it would be easy enough if the injunction were denied for Walgreen to hire its own ice and snow remover and charge the cost to Sara Creek. On the other hand, injunctions to enforce exclusivity clauses are quite likely to be justifiable by just the considerations present here—damages are difficult to estimate with any accuracy and the injunction is a one-shot remedy requiring no continuing judicial involvement. So there is an argument for making injunctive relief presumptively appropriate in such cases, but we need not decide in this case how strong an argument.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The unenacted 2003 Draft of UCC Article 2 provides:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 2–716. Specific Performance.</span></h4>
<p class="list">(1) Specific performance may be decreed if the goods or the agreed performance of the party in breach of contract are unique or in other proper circumstances. In a contract other than a consumer contract, specific performance may be decreed if the parties have agreed to that remedy. However, even if the parties agree to specific performance, specific performance may not be decreed if the breaching party’s sole remaining contractual obligation is the payment of money.</p>
<p class="list">(2) The decree for specific performance may include terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court considers just.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that this proposed model law differs from current law by expressly permitting parties to commercial contracts to contract for the remedy of specific performance. Should parties be permitted to contract for specific performance in the event of breach even if that remedy would not otherwise be proper? What about the costs to third parties, other social and legal values and the judicial system itself discussed in <span class="italic">Walgreen</span>? When would a seller of goods ever need or agree to specific performance?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Judge Posner in <span class="italic">Walgreen</span> notes that “courts have sometimes picked out categories of cases in which injunctive relief is made the norm.” He identifies contracts involving the transfer of real estate as one such area where courts have categorically determined that equitable relief is presumptively available—even if on specific facts it seems likely that damages could be calculated with reasonable certainty. Another such area is contracts for the sale of “unique” goods. UCC 2-716. Difficulties in valuing unique property and the lack of fully adequate market substitutes support the common law presumption that specific performance is generally appropriate in such cases.

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">The basic remedy for breach of contract is an award of damages that gives the injured party the financial equivalent of performance. When a person makes a promise, he undertakes to give the promisee the promised performance or a sum of money that will place the promisee in the same economic position he would have been in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page119" class="pagebreak">119</span>had the promise been performed. Thus, the amount of money to which a promisee is entitled if the promise is not kept is defined by the promise. In this sense, the remedy for breach is as much a creature of the parties’ agreement as the other terms of the promise.</p>
<p class="indent">The basic scheme is easy enough to illustrate. Suppose that Southland had promised to sell Best one carload of plywood for $15,000 but failed to deliver. Assume that on the delivery date the market price had risen to $20,000. Obviously, the disappointed Best could obtain the return of any money paid toward the purchase price and would be excused from paying the rest of the price of the contract. But if Best is to receive the full financial equivalent of performance, it must also be given a sum of money equal to however much more it would have cost on the delivery date to go into the market and buy the plywood elsewhere. The basic formula is that the disappointed buyer is entitled to both the difference between contract price and market price and to the cost of finding a new source of supply. This simple concept can be expressed as: (M-K) + I = D, where M is the market price, K is the contract price, I is incidental costs incurred on account of the breach, and D is the total damages.</p>
<p class="indent">This straightforward example suggests some important points about damage rules in contract law. First, the difference between contract price and market price fails to compensate Best for its sense of injury or the bother resulting from the failure of performance. Second, if the plywood is readily available elsewhere and its market price has remained constant, Best can obtain the equivalent of performance merely by going into the market and buying the plywood at current market prices. When the market can supply plywood at or near the contract price, Best’s money damages will ordinarily be very small or nothing at all.</p>
<p class="indent">As attention shifts from the simple case of the disappointed buyer in a sale of goods contract to other contract situations, the factors which must be taken into account in determining how to give the injured party the financial equivalent of performance may shift. Damage rules assume, as one might predict, a somewhat different shape and sound in different contexts, as you shall see as you study cases involving the sale of goods, personal services, and construction. As you progress through cases that describe the basic scheme, keep in mind that at the core some version of the market minus contract (M-K) theme replicates itself in all contexts, and that in operation the rules are modest both in terms of the interest they protect and the damages they award.</p>
<p class="indent">One limitation on all contract damages is the principle that an injured party cannot collect those damages it might have avoided by reasonable action on its part after it knew of the breach. This is called the rule of avoidable consequences or, more commonly but less accurately, the duty to mitigate damages. This rule usually is justified in terms of causation: the damage claimed was caused by the unreasonable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page120" class="pagebreak">120</span>action or inaction of the injured party rather than the breach itself. Consider the manufacturer that does not receive delivery of raw materials needed to continue operation. If the goods are available elsewhere, the manufacturer should obtain them on the open market and thus limit its loss; it may not shutter its plant and claim all resulting losses. Damages are limited to the contract-market differential. While this limitation is usually referred to as the duty to mitigate damages, it is not a duty in the conventional legal sense. The disappointed buyer does not breach an obligation by failing to go to market, but it may not recover damages for losses which it failed to take reasonable actions to avoid.</p>
<p class="indent">Damages are designed to put the injured party in the same position it would have been in if the contract had been performed by both parties. This leads to another limit on recovery: the monetary remedy must be reduced by any amount that the injured plaintiff saved by not being required to complete its performance of the contract. A disappointed buyer, therefore, does not receive the market price of the promised goods, what it will cost to go into the market to buy them. Instead, the buyer receives only the difference between that market price and what is “saved” because the breach excused the buyer from having to perform its promise to pay the contract price for the goods.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept of savings resulting from a breach merges in many situations with the concept of savings made possible by mitigation. If a buyer has not paid the full contract price, the amount it has not yet paid must of course be deducted from any claim based on the market price of the goods contracted for. If its obligation under the contract is to render performance other than payment of money, the value of the performance it now not only does not have to make, but must stop making, must similarly be deducted. The rationale is that it can now use what is “saved” and it is expected to do so, if possible, in such a way as to obtain its full value.</p>
<p class="indent">This simple structure based on giving the disappointed party the financial equivalent of the promised performance is supplemented in a number of situations by two other approaches to compensation for breach of contract. Sometimes, as our original illustration from <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span> suggests, the disappointed party may have made a partial advance payment or expended time and materials in performance of its obligations under the agreement before the other party’s breach. In that case, the injured party will want its money back; it will seek the return of what it has expended in reliance on the other side’s promise. Compensation for expenditures in reliance can be important even in situations when there has been no change in market price and therefore no damages are recoverable to provide the financial equivalent of performance. In addition, the disappointed party may have conferred benefits on the other side that it wants restored to it. These three elements overlap in many ways and all may be present in the same situation. All derive from the concept of compensatory damages, but they are often treated by scholars and courts as if they were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page121" class="pagebreak">121</span>three distinct “interests.” The distinction may help the student analyze problems, but it becomes potentially misleading if the three interests are understood to be exclusive and competitive rather than complementary or alternative ways of describing the same general approach. The <span id="sec59" />Restatement (Second) of Contracts develops this distinction as follows:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 344. Purposes of Remedies.</span></h4>
<p class="blockquote">Judicial remedies under the rules stated in this Restatement serve to protect one or more of the following interests of a promisee:</p>
<p class="list">(a) his “expectation interest,” which is his interest in having the benefit of his bargain by being put in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed,</p>
<p class="list">(b) his “reliance interest,” which is his interest in being reimbursed for loss caused by reliance on the contract by being put in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract not been made, or</p>
<p class="list">(c) his “restitution interest,” which is his interest in having restored to him any benefit that he has conferred on the other party.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1"><span class="italic">a. Three Interests.</span> The law of contract remedies implements the policy in favor of allowing individuals to order their own affairs by making legally enforceable promises. Ordinarily, when a court concludes that there has been a breach of contract, it enforces the broken promise by protecting the expectation that the injured party had when he made the contract. It does this by attempting to put him in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed, that is, had there been no breach. The interest protected in this way is called the “expectation interest.” It is sometimes said to give the injured party the “benefit of the bargain.” This is not, however, the only interest that may be protected.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1">The promisee may have changed his position in reliance on the contract by, for example, incurring expenses in preparing to perform, in performing, or in foregoing opportunities to make other contracts. In that case, the court may recognize a claim based on his reliance rather than on his expectation. It does this by attempting to put him back in the position in which he would have been had the contract not been made. The interest protected in this way is called “reliance interest.” Although it may be equal to the expectation interest, it is ordinarily smaller because it does not include the injured party’s lost profit.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1">In some situations a court will recognize yet a third interest and grant relief to prevent unjust enrichment. This may be done if a party has not only <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page122" class="pagebreak">122</span>changed his own position in reliance on the contract but has also conferred a benefit on the other party by, for example, making a part payment or furnishing services under the contract. The court may then require the other party to disgorge the benefit that he has received by returning it to the party who conferred it. The interest of the claimant protected in this way is called the “restitution interest.” Although it may be equal to the expectation or reliance interest, it is ordinarily smaller because it includes neither the injured party’s lost profit nor that part of his expenditures in reliance that resulted in no benefit to the other party.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1">The interests described in this Section are not inflexible limits on relief and in situations in which a court grants such relief as justice requires, the relief may not correspond precisely to any of these interests….</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 347. Measure of Damages in General.</span></h4>
<p class="blockquote">Subject to the limitations stated in §§ 350–53, the injured party has a right to damages based on his expectation interest as measured by</p>
<p class="list">(a) the loss in the value to him of the other party’s performance caused by its failure or deficiency, plus</p>
<p class="list">(b) any other loss, including incidental or consequential loss, caused by the breach, less</p>

<p id="sec61" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Thorne v. White</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">District of Columbia Municipal Court of Appeals, 1954.</p>
<p class="sectionb">103 A.2d 579.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ Q<small>UINN</small>, J. Appellant, hereinafter referred to as Thorne, contracted to put a new roof on appellee’s residence and to make certain repairs in connection therewith for the sum of $225. Pursuant to the contract, Thorne delivered certain materials to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page123" class="pagebreak">123</span>job and began work. Within a few hours the work was discontinued because of inclement weather. Thorne never returned to the job and a few days later had his materials hauled away. White then entered into an agreement with the Koons Roofing Company to have the work completed at a cost of $582.26. This was $357.26 more than the amount of Thorne’s contract. He sued Thorne for that difference alleging breach of contract. The court, hearing the case without a jury, ruled in favor of White, and Thorne brings this appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">We find no error in the trial court’s ruling that Thorne had breached the contract. He testified that he had not completed the work because White had ordered him to discontinue, but White denied ever having made such a statement. Thus, the issue as to the breach of contract was clearly one of fact. There was ample support in the evidence to sustain the court’s finding.</p>
<p class="indent">The aspect of the case which gives us more concern is the question of damages. White was awarded a judgment for $357.26, which amount represents the difference between the contract price with Thorne and the amount paid to the Koons Company for the completion of the work. This sum would be the correct measure of damages, provided the second contract did not call for additional work not contemplated by nor included in the first one. This is in accord with the general rule that a party damaged by a breach may only recover for losses which are the natural consequence and proximate result of that breach. Damages are awarded for the purpose of compensation and the injured party should not be placed in a better position than he would have been in had no breach occurred. In cases such as the present one the successful plaintiff should only be allowed to recover what it has cost him to complete the same work, over and above the original contract price.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case the trial court found that the two roofing contracts were substantially the same and that the damages were therefore the amount by which Koons’ contract exceeded Thorne’s price. We rule that such a holding was error. Besides the large difference between the two contract prices, the evidence was that Thorne’s contract called for a 4–ply roof, while the second contract was for what was in effect a 5–ply roof; that Thorne was merely to put a new roof over the old one, while the Koons Company entirely removed the old roof; and that several additional items were provided for under the second contract not called for in the first. A representative of the Koons Company testified that these additional items added to the cost of their contract. As the evidence clearly shows that White received more from the Koons Company than he was to receive from Thorne, we think an improper measure of damages was applied.</p>

<p id="sec65" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Freund v. Washington Square Press</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1974.</p>
<p class="sectionb">34 N.Y.2d 379, 357 N.Y.S.2d 857.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ S<small>AMUEL</small> R<small>ABIN</small>, J. In this action for breach of a publishing contract, we must decide what damages are recoverable for defendant’s failure to publish plaintiff’s manuscript. In 1965, plaintiff, an author and a college teacher, and defendant, Washington Square Press, Inc., entered into a written agreement which, in relevant part, provided as follows. Plaintiff (“author”) granted defendant (“publisher”) exclusive rights to publish and sell in book form plaintiff’s work on modern drama. Upon plaintiff’s delivery of the manuscript, defendant agreed to complete payment of a nonreturnable $2,000 “advance.” Thereafter, if defendant deemed the manuscript not “suitable for publication,” it had the right to terminate the agreement by written notice within 60 days of delivery. Unless so terminated, defendant agreed to publish the work in hardbound edition within 18 months and afterwards in paperbound edition. The contract further provided that defendant would pay royalties to plaintiff, based upon specified percentages of sales. (For example, plaintiff was to receive 10% <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page125" class="pagebreak">125</span>of the retail price of the first 10,000 copies sold in the continental United States.) If defendant failed to publish within 18 months, the contract provided that “this agreement shall terminate and the rights herein granted to the Publisher shall revert to the Author. In such event all payments theretofore made to the Author shall belong to the Author without prejudice to any other remedies which the Author may have.” The contract also provided that controversies were to be determined pursuant to the New York simplified procedure for court determination of disputes (CPLR 3031–3037, Consol.Laws, c. 8).</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff performed by delivering his manuscript to defendant and was paid his $2,000 advance. Defendant thereafter merged with another publisher and ceased publishing in hardbound. Although defendant did not exercise its 60–day right to terminate, it has refused to publish the manuscript in any form.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff commenced the instant action pursuant to the simplified procedure practice and initially sought specific performance of the contract. The Trial Term Justice denied specific performance but, finding a valid contract and a breach by defendant, set the matter down for trial on the issue of monetary damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff. At trial, plaintiff sought to prove: (1) delay of his academic promotion; (2) loss of royalties which would have been earned; and (3) the cost of publication if plaintiff had made his own arrangements to publish. The trial court found that plaintiff had been promoted despite defendant’s failure to publish, and that there was no evidence that the breach had caused any delay. Recovery of lost royalties was denied without discussion. The court found, however, that the cost of hardcover publication to plaintiff was the natural and probable consequence of the breach and, based upon expert testimony, awarded $10,000 to cover this cost. It denied recovery of the expenses of paperbound publication on the ground that plaintiff’s proof was conjectural.</p>
<p class="indent">The Appellate Division, (3 to 2) affirmed, finding that the cost of publication was the proper measure of damages. In support of its conclusion, the majority analogized to the construction contract situation where the cost of completion may be the proper measure of damages for a builder’s failure to complete a house or for use of wrong materials. The dissent concluded that the cost of publication is not an appropriate measure of damages and consequently, that plaintiff may recover nominal damages only. We agree with the dissent. In so concluding, we look to the basic purpose of damage recovery and the nature and effect of the parties’ contract.</p>
<p class="indent">It is axiomatic that, except where punitive damages are allowable, the law awards damages for breach of contract to compensate for injury caused by the breach—injury which was foreseeable, i.e., reasonably within the contemplation of the parties, at the time the contract was entered into. Money damages are substitutional relief designed in theory “to put the injured party in as good a position as he would have been put by full performance of the contract, at the least cost to the defendant and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page126" class="pagebreak">126</span>without charging him with harms that he had no sufficient reason to foresee when he made the contract.” (5 Corbin, Contracts, § 1002, pp. 31–32; 11 Williston, Contracts [3d ed.], § 1338, p. 198.) In other words, so far as possible, the law attempts to secure to the injured party the benefit of his bargain, subject to the limitations that the injury—whether it be losses suffered or gains prevented—was foreseeable, and that the amount of damages claimed be measurable with a reasonable degree of certainty and, of course, adequately proven. But it is equally fundamental that the injured party should not recover more from the breach than he would have gained had the contract been fully performed.</p>
<p class="indent">Measurement of damages in this case according to the cost of publication to the plaintiff would confer greater advantage than performance of the contract would have entailed to plaintiff and would place him in a far better position than he would have occupied had the defendant fully performed. Such measurement bears no relation to compensation for plaintiff’s actual loss or anticipated profit. Far beyond compensating plaintiff for the interests he had in the defendant’s performance of the contract—whether restitution, reliance or expectation, an award of the cost of publication would enrich plaintiff at defendant’s expense.</p>
<p class="indent">Pursuant to the contract, plaintiff delivered his manuscript to the defendant. In doing so, he conferred a value on the defendant which, upon defendant’s breach, was required to be restored to him. Special Term, in addition to ordering a trial on the issue of damages, ordered defendant to return the manuscript to plaintiff and plaintiff’s restitution interest in the contract was thereby protected.</p>
<p class="indent">At the trial on the issue of damages, plaintiff alleged no reliance losses suffered in performing the contract or in making necessary preparations to perform. Had such losses, if foreseeable and ascertainable, been incurred, plaintiff would have been entitled to compensation for them.</p>
<p class="indent">As for plaintiff’s expectation interest in the contract, it was basically two-fold—the “advance” and the royalties. (To be sure, plaintiff may have expected to enjoy whatever notoriety, prestige or other benefits that might have attended publication, but even if these expectations were compensable, plaintiff did not attempt at trial to place a monetary value on them.) There is no dispute that plaintiff’s expectancy in the “advance” was fulfilled—he has received his $2,000. His expectancy interest in the royalties—the profit he stood to gain from sale of the published book—while theoretically compensable, was speculative. Although this work is not plaintiff’s first, at trial he provided no stable foundation for a reasonable estimate of royalties he would have earned had defendant not breached its promise to publish. In these circumstances, his claim for royalties falls for uncertainty.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the damages which would have compensated plaintiff for anticipated royalties were not proved with the required certainty, we agree with the dissent in the Appellate Division that nominal damages alone are recoverable. Though these are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page127" class="pagebreak">127</span>damages in name only and not at all compensatory, they are nevertheless awarded as a formal vindication of plaintiff’s legal right to compensation which has not been given a sufficiently certain monetary valuation.</p>
<p class="indent">In our view, the analogy by the majority in the Appellate Division to the construction contract situation was inapposite. In the typical construction contract, the owner agrees to pay money or other consideration to a builder and expects, under the contract, to receive a completed building in return. The value of the promised performance to the owner is the properly constructed building. In this case, unlike the typical construction contract, the value to plaintiff of the promised performance—publication—was a percentage of sales of the books published and not the books themselves. Had the plaintiff contracted for the printing, binding and delivery of a number of hardbound copies of his manuscript, to be sold or disposed of as he wished, then perhaps the construction analogy, and measurement of damages by the cost of replacement or completion, would have some application.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, however, the specific value to plaintiff of the promised publication was the royalties he stood to receive from defendant’s sales of the published book. Essentially, publication represented what it would have cost the defendant to confer that value upon the plaintiff, and, by its breach, defendant saved that cost. The error by the courts below was in measuring damages not by the value to plaintiff of the promised performance but by the cost of that performance to defendant. Damages are not measured, however, by what the defaulting party saved by the breach, but by the natural and probable consequences of the breach <span class="italic">to the plaintiff.</span> In this case, the consequence to plaintiff of defendant’s failure to publish is that he is prevented from realizing the gains promised by the contract—the royalties. But, as we have stated, the amount of royalties plaintiff would have realized was not ascertained with adequate certainty and, as a consequence, plaintiff may recover nominal damages only.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified to the extent of reducing the damage award of $10,000 for the cost of publication to six cents, but with costs and disbursements to the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="sec66" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. By breaching this contract, the defendant publisher saved the expenses of publication, less what it would have realized net from selling the books. So in this case the breaching defendant ends up better off economically by breaching than by performing, while the injured plaintiff receives only nominal damages.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Did the court give Freund the financial equivalent of performance? Why doesn’t Freund have a claim for his lost royalties? Might Freund have done better on a reliance damages or restitution theory? Does the publisher “returning” the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page128" class="pagebreak">128</span>manuscript place Freund in the position he would have been in had there been no contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Why should uncertainties in calculating damages work against the injured plaintiff rather than the breaching the defendant? Isn’t it the defendant’s fault that we find ourselves in a circumstance where calculating damages is so difficult and speculative?</p>

<p id="sec67" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Sullivan v. O’Connor</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, 1973.</p>
<p class="sectionb">363 Mass. 579, 296 N.E.2d 183.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ K<small>APLAN</small>, J. The plaintiff patient secured a jury verdict of $13,500 against the defendant surgeon for breach of contract in respect to an operation upon the plaintiff’s nose. The substituted consolidated bill of exceptions presents questions about the correctness of the judge’s instructions on the issue of damages.</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration was in two counts. In the first count, the plaintiff alleged that she, as patient, entered into a contract with the defendant, a surgeon, wherein the defendant promised to perform plastic surgery on her nose and thereby to enhance her beauty and improve her appearance; that he performed the surgery but failed to achieve the promised result; rather the result of the surgery was to disfigure and deform her nose, to cause her pain in body and mind, and to subject her to other damage and expense. The second count, based on the same transaction, was in the conventional form for malpractice, charging that the defendant had been guilty of negligence in performing the surgery. Answering, the defendant entered a general denial.</p>
<p class="indent">On the plaintiff’s demand, the case was tried by jury. At the close of the evidence, the judge put to the jury, as special questions, the issues of liability under the two counts, and instructed them accordingly. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on the contract count, and for the defendant on the negligence count. The judge then instructed the jury on the issue of damages.</p>
<p class="indent">As background to the instructions and the parties’ exceptions, we mention certain facts as the jury could find them. The plaintiff was a professional entertainer, and this was known to the defendant. The agreement was as alleged in the declaration. More particularly, judging from exhibits, the plaintiff’s nose had been straight, but long and prominent; the defendant undertook by two operations to reduce its prominence and somewhat to shorten it, thus making it more pleasing in relation to the plaintiff’s other features. Actually the plaintiff was obliged to undergo three operations, and her appearance was worsened. Her nose now had a concave line to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page129" class="pagebreak">129</span>about the midpoint, at which it became bulbous; viewed frontally, the nose from bridge to midpoint was flattened and broadened, and the two sides of the tip had lost symmetry. This configuration evidently could not be improved by further surgery. The plaintiff did not demonstrate, however, that her change of appearance had resulted in loss of employment. Payments by the plaintiff covering the defendant’s fee and hospital expenses were stipulated at $622.65.</p>
<p class="indent">The judge instructed the jury, first, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover her out-of-pocket expenses incident to the operations. Second, she could recover the damages flowing directly, naturally, proximately, and foreseeably from the defendant’s breach of promise. These would comprehend damages for any disfigurement of the plaintiff’s nose—that is, any change of appearance for the worse—including the effects of the consciousness of such disfigurement on the plaintiff’s mind, and in this connection the jury should consider the nature of the plaintiff’s profession. Also consequent upon the defendant’s breach, and compensable, were the pain and suffering involved in the third operation, but not in the first two. As there was no proof that any loss of earnings by the plaintiff resulted from the breach, that element should not enter into the calculation of damages.</p>
<p class="indent">By his exceptions the defendant contends that the judge erred in allowing the jury to take into account anything but the plaintiff’s out-of-pocket expenses (presumably at the stipulated amount). The defendant excepted to the judge’s refusal of his request for a general charge to that effect, and, more specifically, to the judge’s refusal of a charge that the plaintiff could not recover for pain and suffering connected with the third operation or for impairment of the plaintiff’s appearance and associated mental distress.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff on her part excepted to the judge’s refusal of a request to charge that the plaintiff could recover the difference in value between the nose as promised and the nose as it appeared after the operations. However, the plaintiff in her brief expressly waives this exception and others made by her in case this court overrules the defendant’s exceptions; thus she would be content to hold the jury’s verdict in her favor.</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that the defendant’s exceptions should be overruled.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been suggested on occasion that agreements between patients and physicians by which the physician undertakes to effect a cure or to bring about a given result should be declared unenforceable on grounds of public policy. But there are many decisions recognizing and enforcing such contracts, and the law of Massachusetts has treated them as valid, although we have had no decision meeting head on the contention that they should be denied legal sanction. These causes of action are, however, considered a little suspect, and thus we find courts straining sometimes to read the pleadings as sounding only in tort for negligence, and not in contract for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page130" class="pagebreak">130</span>breach of promise, despite sedulous efforts by the pleaders to pursue the latter theory.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not hard to see why the courts should be unenthusiastic or skeptical about the contract theory. Considering the uncertainties of medical science and the variations in the physical and psychological conditions of individual patients, doctors can seldom in good faith promise specific results. Therefore it is unlikely that physicians of even average integrity will in fact make such promises. Statements of opinion by the physician with some optimistic coloring are a different thing, and may indeed have therapeutic value. But patients may transform such statements into firm promises in their own minds, especially when they have been disappointed in the event, and testify in that sense to sympathetic juries.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_11" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-11" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> If actions for breach of promise can be readily maintained, doctors, so it is said, will be frightened into practising “defensive medicine.” On the other hand, if these actions were outlawed, leaving only the possibility of suits for malpractice, there is fear that the public might be exposed to the enticements of charlatans, and confidence in the profession might ultimately be shaken. The law has taken the middle of the road position of allowing actions based on alleged contract, but insisting on clear proof. Instructions to the jury may well stress this requirement and point to tests of truth, such as the complexity or difficulty of an operation as bearing on the probability that a given result was promised.</p>
<p class="indent">If an action on the basis of contract is allowed, we have next the question of the measure of damages to be applied where liability is found. Some cases have taken the simple view that the promise by the physician is to be treated like an ordinary commercial promise, and accordingly that the successful plaintiff is entitled to a standard measure of recovery for breach of contract—“compensatory” (“expectancy”) damages, an amount intended to put the plaintiff in the position he would be in if the contract had been performed, or, presumably, at the plaintiff’s election, “restitution” damages, an amount corresponding to any benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant in the performance of the contract disrupted by the defendant’s breach. Thus in <span class="italic">Hawkins v. McGee</span>, 84 N.H. 114, the defendant doctor was taken to have promised the plaintiff to convert his damaged hand by means of an operation into a good or perfect hand, but the doctor so operated as to damage the hand still further. The court, following the usual expectancy formula, would have asked the jury to estimate and award to the plaintiff the difference between the value of a good or perfect hand, as promised, and the value of the hand after the operation. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page131" class="pagebreak">131</span>(The same formula would apply, although the dollar result would be less, if the operation had neither worsened nor improved the condition of the hand.) If the plaintiff had not yet paid the doctor his fee, that amount would be deducted from the recovery. There could be no recovery for the pain and suffering of the operation, since that detriment would have been incurred even if the operation had been successful; one can say that this detriment was not “caused” by the breach. But where the plaintiff by reason of the operation was put to more pain than he would have had to endure, had the doctor performed as promised, he should be compensated for that difference as a proper part of his expectancy recovery. It may be noted that on an alternative count for malpractice the plaintiff in the <span class="italic">Hawkins</span> case had been nonsuited; but on ordinary principles this could not affect the contract claim, for it is hardly a defence to a breach of contract that the promisor acted innocently and without negligence. The New Hampshire court further refined the <span class="italic">Hawkins</span> analysis in <span class="italic">McQuaid v. Michou</span>, 85 N.H. 299, all in the direction of treating the patient-physician cases on the ordinary footing of expectancy.</p>
<p class="indent">Other cases, including a number in New York, without distinctly repudiating the <span class="italic">Hawkins</span> type of analysis, have indicated that a different and generally more lenient measure of damages is to be applied in patient-physician actions based on breach of alleged special agreements to effect a cure, attain a stated result, or employ a given medical method. This measure is expressed in somewhat variant ways, but the substance is that the plaintiff is to recover any expenditures made by him and for other detriment (usually not specifically described in the opinions) following proximately and foreseeably upon the defendant’s failure to carry out his promise. This, be it noted, is not a “restitution” measure, for it is not limited to restoration of the benefit conferred on the defendant (the fee paid) but includes other expenditures, for example, amounts paid for medicine and nurses; so also it would seem according to its logic to take in damages for any worsening of the plaintiff’s condition due to the breach. Nor is it an “expectancy” measure, for it does not appear to contemplate recovery of the whole difference in value between the condition as promised and the condition actually resulting from the treatment. Rather the tendency of the formulation is to put the plaintiff back in the position he occupied just before the parties entered upon the agreement, to compensate him for the detriments he suffered in reliance upon the agreement. This kind of intermediate pattern of recovery for breach of contract is discussed in the suggestive article by Fuller and Perdue, <span class="italic">The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages</span>, where the authors show that, although not attaining the currency of the standard measures, a “reliance” measure has for special reasons been applied by the courts in a variety of settings, including noncommercial settings.</p>
<p class="indent">For breach of the patient-physician agreements under consideration, a recovery limited to restitution seems plainly too meager, if the agreements are to be enforced <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page132" class="pagebreak">132</span>at all. On the other hand, an expectancy recovery may well be excessive. The factors, already mentioned, which have made the cause of action somewhat suspect, also suggest moderation as to the breadth of the recovery that should be permitted. Where, as in the case at bar and in a number of the reported cases, the doctor has been absolved of negligence by the trier, an expectancy measure may be thought harsh. We should recall here that the fee paid by the patient to the doctor for the alleged promise would usually be quite disproportionate to the putative expectancy recovery. To attempt, moreover, to put a value on the condition that would or might have resulted, had the treatment succeeded as promised, may sometimes put an exceptional strain on the imagination of the fact finder. As a general consideration, Fuller and Perdue argue that the reasons for granting damages for broken promises to the extent of the expectancy are at their strongest when the promises are made in a business context, when they have to do with the production or distribution of goods or the allocation of functions in the market place; they become weaker as the context shifts from a commercial to a noncommercial field.</p>
<p class="indent">There is much to be said, then, for applying a reliance measure to the present facts, and we have only to add that our cases are not unreceptive to the use of that formula in special situations. We have, however, had no previous occasion to apply it to patient-physician cases.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_12" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-12" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The question of recovery on a reliance basis for pain and suffering or mental distress requires further attention. We find expressions in the decisions that pain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page133" class="pagebreak">133</span>and suffering (or the like) are simply not compensable in actions for breach of contract. The defendant seemingly espouses this proposition in the present case. True, if the buyer under a contract for the purchase of a lot of merchandise, in suing for the seller’s breach, should claim damages for mental anguish caused by his disappointment in the transaction, he would not succeed; he would be told, perhaps, that the asserted psychological injury was not fairly foreseeable by the defendant as a probable consequence of the breach of such a business contract. But there is no general rule barring such items of damage in actions for breach of contract. It is all a question of the subject matter and background of the contract, and when the contract calls for an operation on the person of the plaintiff, psychological as well as physical injury may be expected to figure somewhere in the recovery, depending on the particular circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, it is said in a few of the New York cases, concerned with the classification of actions for statute of limitations purposes, that the absence of allegations demanding recovery for pain and suffering is characteristic of a contract claim by a patient against a physician, that such allegations rather belong in a claim for malpractice. These remarks seem unduly sweeping. Suffering or distress resulting from the breach going beyond that which was envisaged by the treatment as agreed, should be compensable on the same ground as the worsening of the patient’s conditions because of the breach. Indeed it can be argued that the very suffering or distress “contracted for”—that which would have been incurred if the treatment achieved the promised result—should also be compensable on the theory underlying the New York cases. For that suffering is “wasted” if the treatment fails. Otherwise stated, compensation for this waste is arguably required in order to complete the restoration of the status quo ante.</p>
<p class="indent">In the light of the foregoing discussion, all the defendant’s exceptions fail: the plaintiff was not confined to the recovery of her out-of-pocket expenditures; she was entitled to recover also for the worsening of her condition, and for the pain and suffering and mental distress involved in the third operation. These items were compensable on either an expectancy or a reliance view. We might have been required to elect between the two views if the pain and suffering connected with the first two operations contemplated by the agreement, or the whole difference in value between the present and the promised conditions, were being claimed as elements of damage. But the plaintiff waives her possible claim to the former element, and to so much of the latter as represents the difference in value between the promised condition and the condition before the operations.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff’s exceptions waived.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s exceptions overruled.</p>

Murphy who has a morbid fear of death, dying and cadavers, emphatically rejects the allograft option but agrees to hire Dr. Implicito to perform the autograft procedure.

<p id="sec70" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Anglia Television Ltd. v. Reed</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Court of Appeal, Civil Division, 1971.</p>
<p class="sectionb">[1972] 1 Q.B. 60, [1971] All E.R. 690.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ L<small>ORD</small> D<small>ENNING</small>, M<small>ASTER OF THE</small> R<small>OLLS</small>. Anglia Television Ltd. were minded in 1968 to make a film of a play for television entitled <span class="italic">The Man in the Wood</span>. It portrayed an American married to an English woman. The American has an adventure in an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page135" class="pagebreak">135</span>English wood. The film was to last for 90 minutes. Anglia Television made many arrangements in advance. They arranged for a place where the play was to be filmed. They employed a director, a designer and a stage manager, and so forth. They involved themselves in much expense. All this was done before they got the leading man. They required a strong actor capable of holding the play together. He was to be on the scene the whole time. Anglia Television eventually found the man. He was Mr. Robert Reed, an American who has a very high reputation as an actor. He was very suitable for this part. By telephone conversation on 30th August 1968 it was agreed by Mr. Reed through his agent that he would come to England and be available between 9th September and 11th October 1968 to rehearse and play in this film. He was to get a performance fee of £1,050, living expenses of £100 a week, his first class fares to and from the United States, and so forth. It was all subject to the permit of the Ministry of Labour for him to come here. That was duly given on 2nd September 1968. So the contract was concluded. But unfortunately there was some muddle with the bookings. It appears that Mr. Reed’s agent had already booked him in America for some other play. So on 3rd September 1968 the agent said that Mr. Reed would not come to England to perform in this play. He repudiated his contract. Anglia Television tried hard to find a substitute but could not do so. So on 11th September they accepted his repudiation. They abandoned the proposed film. They gave notice to the people whom they had engaged and so forth.</p>
<p class="indent">Anglia Television then sued Mr. Reed for damages. He did not dispute his liability, but a question arose as to the damages. Anglia Television do not claim their profit. They cannot say what their profit would have been on this contract if Mr. Reed had come here and performed it. So, instead of claim for loss of profits, they claim for the wasted expenditure. They had incurred the director’s fees, the designer’s fees, the stage manager’s and assistant manager’s fees, and so on. It comes in all to £2,750. Anglia Television say that all that money was wasted because Mr. Reed did not perform his contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Reed’s advisers take a point of law. They submit that Anglia Television cannot recover for expenditure incurred <span class="italic">before</span> the contract was concluded with Mr. Reed. They can only recover the expenditure <span class="italic">after</span> the contract was concluded. They say that the expenditure <span class="italic">after</span> the contract was only £854.65, and that is all that Anglia Television can recover. The master rejected that contention; he held that Anglia Television could recover the whole £2,750; and now Mr. Reed appeals to this court.</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel for Mr. Reed has referred us to the recent unreported case of <span class="italic">Perestrello &amp; Compania Limitada v. United Paint Co. Ltd. (No. 2)</span>, in which Thesiger, J., quoted the words of Lord Tindal, CJ, in 1835 in <span class="italic">Hodges v. Earl of Litchfield</span>:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“The expenses preliminary to the contract ought not to be allowed. The party enters into them for his own benefit at a time when it is uncertain whether there will be any contract or not.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page136" class="pagebreak">136</div>
<p class="indent">Thesiger, J., applied those words, saying: “In my judgment pre-contract expenditure, though thrown away, is not recoverable …”</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot accept the proposition as stated. It seems to me that a plaintiff in such a case as this had an election: he can either claim for his loss of profits; or for his wasted expenditure. But he must elect between them. He cannot claim both. If he has not suffered any loss of profits—or if he cannot prove what his profits would have been—he can claim in the alternative the expenditure which has been thrown away, that is, wasted, by reason of the breach….</p>
<p class="indent">If the plaintiff claims the wasted expenditure, he is not limited to the expenditure incurred <span class="italic">after</span> the contract was concluded. He can claim also the expenditure incurred <span class="italic">before</span> the contract, provided that it was such as would reasonably be in the contemplation of the parties as likely to be wasted if the contract was broken. Applying that principle here, it is plain that, when Mr. Reed entered into this contract, he must have known perfectly well that much expenditure had already been incurred on director’s fees and the like. He must have contemplated—or, at any rate, it is reasonably to be imputed to him—that if he broke his contract, all that expenditure would be wasted, whether or not it was incurred before or after the contract. He must pay damages for all the expenditure so wasted and thrown away. This view is supported by the recent decision of Brightman, J., in <span class="italic">Lloyd v. Stanbury</span>. There was a contract for the sale of land. In anticipation of the contract—and before it was concluded—the purchaser went to much expense in moving a caravan to the site and in getting his furniture there. The seller afterwards entered into a contract to sell the land to the purchaser, but afterwards broke his contract. The land had not increased in value, so the purchaser could not claim for any loss of profit. But Brightman, J., held that he could recover the cost of moving the caravan and furniture, because it was “within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was signed.” That decision is in accord with correct principle, namely, that wasted expenditure can be recovered when it is wasted by reason of the defendant’s breach of contract. It is true that, if the defendant had never entered into the contract, he would not be liable, and the expenditure would have been incurred by the plaintiff without redress; but, the defendant having made his contract and broken it, it does not lie in his mouth to say he is not liable, when it was because of his breach that the expenditure has been wasted.</p>
<p class="indent">I think the master was quite right and this appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<p id="sec71" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Anglia Television recovers its outlays on the whole project to make <span class="italic">The Man in the Wood</span>. Can this result be explained in terms of the three interests described in Restatement, Second, § 344? Anglia conferred no benefit on Reed, so the available <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page137" class="pagebreak">137</span>options are the expectancy and the reliance interests. In what sense does the award of these outlays give Anglia the financial equivalent of performance? How can it be claimed that Anglia was relying on Reed in making outlays before it had a contract with him?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What is the significance of the fact that Anglia abandoned the project?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. What might Lord Denning mean when he says that Anglia Television couldn’t find a substitute? Was Robert Reed the only actor in the world who could play the role?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Compare Lord Denning’s analysis of wasted pre-contractual expenditures in <span class="italic">Anglia Television</span> with Judge Richard Posner’s analysis of the recoverability of fixed overhead expenses in <span class="italic">Autotrol Corp. v. Continental Water Sys. Corp</span>., 918 F.2d 689 (7th Cir. 1990):</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The question of the proper treatment of overhead expenses arises more frequently in cases in which the plaintiff is seeking not the expenses themselves—they have not been incurred—but the price of a contract that has not yet been fully performed, and the defendant asks that the overhead expenses assigned by the plaintiff on the uncompleted portion of the contract be deducted, on the theory that they were saved by the breach and therefore that their inclusion would exaggerate the plaintiff’s loss. The proper analysis of that case is symmetrical with the proper analysis of our case. If the plaintiff can either cut his overhead expenses or recover them in a substitute contract, then he indeed has not lost them as a result of the breach and they should not be figured in his damages. But if he cannot do either of these things—if in other words these really are fixed costs—then the breach gives him no scope to economize and there should be no deduction.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The breach in this case of course occurred after the overhead expenses were incurred. This sequence meant that the breach, far from enabling those expenses to be covered in a substitute contract, converted them from a bookkeeping entry into a loss, because it was too late for the plaintiff to make the substitute contract that would have enabled the plaintiff to recover the expenses. If there had been a contract price, therefore, the jury would not have been entitled to subtract the overhead expenses from it in figuring Autotrol’s damages. The only thing to be subtracted would be expenses not yet incurred, and therefore saved by the breach. But there was no contract price. Autotrol was not selling something to Continental; they were joint venturers. That made figuring profits difficult and the implicit theory of the damages award is that Autotrol would have had zero profits on the venture, and is thus conservative. The defendants do not deny <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page138" class="pagebreak">138</span>that Autotrol would have done well enough on the contract to cover the overhead expenses allocated to it, and with that concession Autotrol’s case is complete.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The assumption of zero profits is based on the rule of Texas law “that the loss of anticipated profits from a new business is too speculative and conjectural to support a recovery of damages.” Were it not for that rule Autotrol would not be seeking reliance damages, but instead expectation damages, and the issue of overhead expenses to which we have been devoting such complex attention would be simplified.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Alfred Thompson Denning (1899-1999) was one of the greatest English judges of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, perhaps of all time. He had a distinguished, but at times controversial, appellate career as a law lord sitting in the House of Lords (predecessor to the current Supreme Court of the United Kingdom) and as Master of Rolls, the senior appellate judge on the Court of Appeal, the second highest court in the British system. Note the discursive quality of Lord Denning’s <span class="italic">Anglia Television</span> opinion which reflects traditional English appellate practice featuring extemporaneous <span class="italic">seriatim</span> oral rulings by impressively bewigged lords bedecked in scarlet robes immediately following often extended oral argument by counsel. Appellate practice in the United States relies predominantly on more formal and elaborate written briefs by the parties and written opinions of the court. American appellate courts commonly dispense with oral argument altogether in many less difficult matters, and rarely, if ever, make oral rulings on the merits from the bench.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec72" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">3.    Restitution Interest</span></h5>
<p class="indent">A court may also award contract damages based on an injured party’s restitution interest to restore to the injured party any value that it may have conferred on the breaching party. This concept of restitutionary damages stems from the same fundamental idea as the alternative body of restitution doctrine we will study in Chapter Three. The distinction, however, is important. Here, the restitutionary interest describes a type of contract damages. In Chapter Three, restitution (also known as quantum meruit or unjust enrichment) constitutes an alternative doctrinal basis for recovery often available in contexts where no action for breach of contract can be supported or where standard contract doctrine yields a less favorable recovery.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>ETERS</small>, C.J. in <span id="sec73" class="italic">Bernstein v. Nemeyer</span>, 213 Conn. 665, 673-74 (1990):</p>
<p class="indentn">When a court grants [the remedy of restitution] for breach, the party in breach is required to account for a benefit that has been conferred on him by the injured party * * *. In contrast to cases in which the court grants specific performance or awards damages as a remedy for breach, the effort is not to enforce the promise by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page139" class="pagebreak">139</span>protecting the injured party’s expectation or reliance interest, but to prevent unjust enrichment of the party in breach by protecting the injured party’s restitution interest. The objective is not to put the injured party in as good a position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed, nor even to put the injured party back in the position he would have been in if the contract had not been made; it is, rather, to put the party in breach back in the position he would have been in if the contract had not been made. E. A. Farnsworth, Contracts (1982) § 12.19. When an injured party seeks an award of money to protect his restitutionary interest, any award “may as justice requires be measured by either (a) the reasonable value to the other party of what he received * * * or (b) the extent to which the other party’s property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 371 (1981).</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Contract doctrine favors expectation and reliance interest remedies, and contract damages based on a restitutionary interest have been rarely awarded. But recently some commentators, drawing some support from the new Restatement (Third) of Restitution, and criticizing the under-compensatory effect of the traditional rules, have urged a renewed emphasis on disgorgement by the breaching party as a measure of contract damages. Steve Thel &amp; Peter Siegelman, <span class="italic">You</span> Do <span class="italic">Have to Keep Your Promises: A Disgorgement Theory of Contract Remedies</span>, 52 W<small>M</small>. &amp; M<small>ARY</small> L. R<small>EV</small>. 1181 (2011). Restitution as an alternative to contract damages (rather than a measure of recovery in contract itself), however, remains a far more common approach in practice, as we shall see in Chapter Three.</p>

<p id="sec75" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, 1929.</p>
<p class="sectionb">35 F.2d 301.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>ARKER</small>, J. This was an action at law instituted in the court below by the Luten Bridge Company, as plaintiff, to recover of Rockingham County, North Carolina, an amount alleged to be due under a contract for the construction of a bridge. The county admits the execution and breach of the contract, but contends that notice of cancellation was given the bridge company before the erection of the bridge was commenced, and that it is liable only for the damages which the company would have sustained, if it had abandoned construction at that time. The judge below refused to strike out an answer filed by certain members of the board of commissioners <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page140" class="pagebreak">140</span>of the county, admitting liability in accordance with the prayer of the complaint, allowed this pleading to be introduced in evidence as the answer of the county, excluded evidence offered by the county in support of its contentions as to notice of cancellation and damages, and instructed a verdict for plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. From judgment on this verdict the county has appealed.</p>
<p class="indent">As the county now admits the execution and validity of the contract, and the breach on its part, the ultimate question in the case is one as to the measure of plaintiff’s recovery….</p>
<p class="indent">… [W]e do not think that, after the county had given notice, while the contract was still executory, that it did not desire the bridge built and would not pay for it, plaintiff could proceed to build it and recover the contract price. It is true that the county had no right to rescind the contract, and the notice given plaintiff amounted to a breach on its part; but, after plaintiff had received notice of the breach, it was its duty to do nothing to increase the damages flowing therefrom. If A enters into a binding contract to build a house for B, B, of course, has no right to rescind the contract without A’s consent. But if, before the house is built, he decides that he does not want it, and notifies A to that effect, A has no right to proceed with the building and thus pile up damages. His remedy is to treat the contract as broken when he receives the notice, and sue for the recovery of such damages as he may have sustained from the breach, including any profit which he would have realized upon performance, as well as any other losses which may have resulted to him. In the case at bar, the county decided not to build the road of which the bridge was to be a part, and did not build it. The bridge, built in the midst of the forest, is of no value to the county because of this change of circumstances. When, therefore, the county gave notice to the plaintiff that it would not proceed with the project, plaintiff should have desisted from further work. It had no right thus to pile up damages by proceeding with the erection of a useless bridge.</p>
<p class="indent">The contrary view was expressed by Lord Cockburn in <span class="italic">Frost v. Knight</span>, L.R. 7 Ex. 111, but, as pointed out by Prof. Williston (Williston on Contracts, vol. 3, p. 2347), it is not in harmony with the decisions in this country. The American rule and the reasons supporting it are well stated by Prof. Williston as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">There is a line of cases running back to 1845 which holds that after an absolute repudiation or refusal to perform by one party to a contract, the other party cannot continue to perform and recover damages based on full performance. This rule is only a particular application of the general rule of damages that a plaintiff cannot hold a defendant liable for damages which need not have been incurred; or, as it is often stated, the plaintiff must, so far as he can without loss to himself, mitigate the damages caused by the defendant’s wrongful act. The application of this rule to the matter in question is obvious. If a man engages to have work done, and afterwards repudiates his contract before the work has been <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page141" class="pagebreak">141</span>begun or when it has been only partially done, it is inflicting damage on the defendant without benefit to the plaintiff to allow the latter to insist on proceeding with the contract. The work may be useless to the defendant, and yet he would be forced to pay the full contract price. On the other hand, the plaintiff is interested only in the profit he will make out of the contract. If he receives this it is equally advantageous for him to use his time otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">The leading case on the subject in this country is the New York case of <span class="italic">Clark v. Marsiglia</span>, 1 Denio (N.Y.) 317. In that case defendant had employed plaintiff to paint certain pictures for him, but countermanded the order before the work was finished. Plaintiff, however, went on and completed the work and sued for the contract price. In reversing a judgment for plaintiff, the court said:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The plaintiff was allowed to recover as though there had been no countermand of the order; and in this the court erred. The defendant, by requiring the plaintiff to stop work upon the paintings, violated his contract, and thereby incurred a liability to pay such damages as the plaintiff should sustain. Such damages would include a recompense for the labor done and materials used, and such further sum in damages as might, upon legal principles, be assessed for the breach of the contract; but the plaintiff had no right, by obstinately persisting in the work, to make the penalty upon the defendant greater than it would otherwise have been.</p>
<p class="indent">… It follows that there was error in directing a verdict for plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. The measure of plaintiff’s damage, upon its appearing that notice was duly given not to build the bridge, is an amount sufficient to compensate plaintiff for labor and materials expended and expense incurred in the part performance of the contract, prior to its repudiation, plus the profit which would have been realized if it had been carried out in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversed.</p>
<p id="sec76" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Why are some county commissioners admitting liability to Luten Bridge Co. and other commissioners seeking to strike the admission? If the county commission was divided and some were in favor of canceling the bridge project, while others were urging its completion, what would you advise Luten Bridge Co. to do?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. In this case, the builder could not continue to build after being told not to. This makes good sense. And so long as the builder gets the full profit that it would have made on the job if it had been permitted to complete that job, there’s no reason for it to complain.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page142" class="pagebreak">142</div>
<p class="indent">But what about the laborers who were counting on the job with Luten Bridge Co.? Will they be paid their wages? The only way Luten Bridge can be made whole by paying it only its lost profit is if it “saves” the workers’ wages. Does the county owe the workers a duty? One might say that the costs of the breach are borne not by the breaching promisor and not by the promisee, whose profits are protected, but by those who lose because of the breach when the parties to the contract “save” their wages.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. What about the time now available to it because of the County’s breach? If the bridge company immediately took another bridge job on which it made a tremendous profit, should this be used to reduce its damages against the County? Does this depend on how many bridge jobs the company could handle at one time? Suppose it lost money on the second job?</p>
<p class="indent">If the court is committed to making breach as cheap as possible, why doesn’t it really make Luten Bridge use its time well? Wouldn’t it make economic sense to subtract from Luten’s lost profit that profit that Luten might have earned had it put to work those resources “freed up” as a result of Rockingham County’s breach?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The bridge to nowhere made famous in this case still stands. Subsequently connected to roads on each end in 1968, in 2003 the bridge closed to vehicular traffic, but it remains open to pedestrians and supports a sewer main.

<p class="indent">The plaintiff entered upon his service under the contract, at the time mentioned therein, and continued to perform the theatrical characterizations assigned to him, without any suggestion of incompetency, and to receive the stipulated weekly salary, until the end of the eighteenth week; when he was discharged by the defendants, as they contended before the jury for incompetency under the rule; but, as the plaintiff there contended, for the reason that he declined to accept twenty-four dollars per week during the remainder of his term of service.</p>
<p class="indent">Three days after his discharge and before the expiration of the nineteenth week, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for the defendants’ breach of the contract. The action was not premature. The contract was entire and indivisible. The performance of it had been commenced, and the plaintiff been discharged and thereby been prevented from the further execution of it; and the action was not brought until after the discharge and consequent breach. The doctrine of <span class="italic">Daniels v. Newton</span>, 114 Mass. 530, is not opposed to this. Neither do the defendants insist that the action was prematurely commenced; but they contend that the verdict should be set aside as being against the weight of evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The verdict was for the plaintiff. The jury must, therefore, have found the real cause of his discharge to be his refusal to consent to the proposed reduction of his salary. The evidence upon this point was quite conflicting. Considering that all the company were notified, at the same time, that their respective salaries would be reduced one-third, without assigning any such cause as incompetency; that no suggestion of the plaintiff’s incompetency was ever made to him, prior to his discharge; and that his written discharge was equally silent upon that subject, we fail to find sufficient reason for disturbing the verdict upon this ground of the motion, especially since the jury might well find as they did on this branch of the case, provided they believed the testimony in behalf of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several classes of cases founded both in tort and in contract, wherein the plaintiff is entitled to recover, not only the damages actually sustained when the action was commenced, or at the time of the trial, but also whatever the evidence proves he will be likely to suffer thereafter from the same cause. Among the torts coming within this rule, are personal injuries caused by the wrongful acts or negligence of others. The injury continuing beyond the time of trial, the future as well as the past is to be considered, since no other action can be maintained. So in cases of contract the performance of which is to extend through a period of time which has <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page144" class="pagebreak">144</span>not elapsed when the breach is made and the action brought therefor and the trial had. Among these are actions on bonds or unsealed contracts stipulating for the support of persons during their natural life.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract in controversy falls within the same rule. Although, as practically construed by the parties, the salary was payable weekly, still, when the plaintiff was peremptorily discharged from all further service during the remainder of the season, such discharge conferred upon him the right to treat the contract as entirely at an end, and to bring his action to recover damages for the breach. In such action he is entitled to a just recompense for the actual injury sustained by the illegal discharge. Prima facie, such recompense would be the stipulated wages for the remaining eighteen weeks. This, however, would not necessarily be the sum which he would be entitled to; for in cases of contract as well as of tort, it is generally incumbent upon an injured party to do whatever he reasonably can, and to improve all reasonable and proper opportunities to lessen the injury. The plaintiff could not be justified in lying idle after the breach; but he was bound to use ordinary diligence in securing employment elsewhere, during the remainder of the term; and whatever sum he actually earned or might have earned by the use of reasonable diligence, should be deducted from the amount of the unpaid stipulated wages. And this balance with interest thereon should be the amount of the verdict. Applying the rule mentioned, the verdict will be found too large.</p>
<p class="indent">By the plaintiff’s own testimony, he received only $60, from all sources after his discharge—$25 in February and $35 from the 10th to the 20th of April, at Booth’s. His last engagement was for eight weeks, commencing April 10, which he abandoned on the 20th, thus voluntarily omitting an opportunity to earn $57, prior to the expiration of his engagement with the defendants, when the law required him to improve such an opportunity, if reasonable and proper. We think he should have continued the last engagement until May 6, instead of abandoning it and urging a trial in April, especially inasmuch as he could have obtained a trial in May, just as well. The instructions taken together were as favorable to the defendants as they were entitled to.</p>
<p class="indent">If, therefore, the plaintiff will remit $57, he may have judgment for the balance of the verdict; otherwise the entry must be verdict set aside and new trial granted.</p>

<p class="noindent-squ1">■ B<small>URKE</small>, J. Defendant Twentieth Century–Fox Film Corporation appeals from a summary judgment granting to plaintiff the recovery of agreed compensation under <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page145" class="pagebreak">145</span>a written contract for her services as an actress in a motion picture. As will appear, we have concluded that the trial court correctly ruled in plaintiff’s favor and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff is well known as an actress, and in the contract between plaintiff and defendant is sometimes referred to as the “Artist.” Under the contract, dated August 6, 1965, plaintiff was to play the female lead in defendant’s contemplated production of a motion picture entitled “Bloomer Girl.” The contract provided that defendant would pay plaintiff a minimum “guaranteed compensation” of $53,571.42 per week for 14 weeks commencing May 23, 1966, for a total of $750,000. Prior to May 1966 defendant decided not to produce the picture and by a letter dated April 4, 1966, it notified plaintiff of that decision and that it would not “comply with our obligations to you under” the written contract.</p>
<p class="indent">By the same letter and with the professed purpose “to avoid any damage to you,” defendant instead offered to employ plaintiff as the leading actress in another film tentatively entitled “Big Country, Big Man” (hereinafter, “Big Country”). The compensation offered was identical, as were 31 of the 34 numbered provisions or articles of the original contract.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_13" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-13" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> Unlike “Bloomer Girl,” however, which was to have been a musical production, “Big Country” was a dramatic “western type” movie. “Bloomer Girl” was to have been filmed in California; “Big Country” was to be produced in Australia. Also, certain terms in the proffered contract varied from those of the original.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_14" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-14" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> Plaintiff was given one week within which to accept; she did <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page146" class="pagebreak">146</span>not, and the offer lapsed. Plaintiff then commenced this action seeking recovery of the agreed guaranteed compensation.</p>
<p class="indent">The complaint sets forth two causes of action. The first is for money due under the contract; the second, based upon the same allegations as the first, is for damages resulting from defendant’s breach of contract. Defendant in its answer admits the existence and validity of the contract, that plaintiff complied with all the conditions, covenants and promises and stood ready to complete the performance, and that defendant breached and “anticipatorily repudiated” the contract. It denies, however, that any money is due to plaintiff either under the contract or as a result of its breach, and pleads as an affirmative defense to both causes of action plaintiff’s allegedly deliberate failure to mitigate damages, asserting that she unreasonably refused to accept its offer of the leading role in “Big Country.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff moved for summary judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, the motion was granted, and summary judgment for $750,000 plus interest was entered in plaintiff’s favor. This appeal by defendant followed.</p>
<p class="indent">The familiar rules are that the matter to be determined by the trial court on a motion for summary judgment is whether facts have been presented which give rise to a triable factual issue. The court may not pass upon the issue itself. Summary judgment is proper only if the affidavits or declarations in support of the moving party would be sufficient to sustain a judgment in his favor and his opponent does not by affidavit show facts sufficient to present a triable issue of fact. The affidavits of the moving party are strictly construed, and doubts as to the propriety of summary judgment should be resolved against granting the motion. Such summary procedure is drastic and should be used with caution so that it does not become a substitute for the open trial method of determining facts. The moving party cannot depend upon allegations in his own pleadings to cure deficient affidavits, nor can his adversary rely upon his own pleadings in lieu or in support of affidavits in opposition to a motion; however, a party can rely on his adversary’s pleadings to establish facts not contained in his own affidavits. Also, the court may consider facts stipulated to by the parties and facts which are properly the subject of judicial notice.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page147" class="pagebreak">147</div>
<p class="indent">As stated, defendant’s sole defense to this action which resulted from its deliberate breach of contract is that in rejecting defendant’s substitute offer of employment plaintiff unreasonably refused to mitigate damages.</p>
<p class="indent">The general rule is that the measure of recovery by a wrongfully discharged employee is the amount of salary agreed upon for the period of service, less the amount which the employer affirmatively proves the employee has earned or with reasonable effort might have earned from other employment. However, before projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation, the employer must show that the other employment was comparable, or substantially similar, to that of which the employee has been deprived; the employee’s rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages.</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case defendant has raised no issue of <span class="italic">reasonableness of efforts</span> by plaintiff to obtain other employment; the sole issue is whether plaintiff’s refusal of defendant’s substitute offer of “Big Country” may be used in mitigation. Nor, if the “Big Country” offer was of employment different or inferior when compared with the original “Bloomer Girl” employment, is there an issue as to whether or not plaintiff acted reasonably in refusing the substitute offer. Despite defendant’s arguments to the contrary, no case cited or which our research has discovered holds or suggests that reasonableness is an element of a wrongfully discharged employee’s option to reject, or fail to seek, different or inferior employment lest the possible earnings therefrom be charged against him in mitigation of damages.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_15" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-15" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Applying the foregoing rules to the record in the present case, with all intendments in favor of the party opposing the summary judgment motion—here, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page148" class="pagebreak">148</span>defendant—it is clear that the trial court correctly ruled that plaintiff’s failure to accept defendant’s tendered substitute employment could not be applied in mitigation of damages because the offer of the “Big Country” lead was of employment both different and inferior, and that no factual dispute was presented on that issue. The mere circumstance that “Bloomer Girl” was to be a musical review calling upon plaintiff’s talents as a dancer as well as an actress, and was to be produced in the City of Los Angeles, whereas “Big Country” was a straight dramatic role in a “Western Type” story taking place in an opal mine in Australia, demonstrates the difference in kind between the two employments; the female lead as a dramatic actress in a western style motion picture can by no stretch of imagination be considered the equivalent of or substantially similar to the lead in a song-and-dance production.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, the substitute “Big Country” offer proposed to eliminate or impair the director and screenplay approvals accorded to plaintiff under the original “Bloomer Girl” contract (see fn. 2, ante), and thus constituted an offer of inferior employment. No expertise or judicial notice is required in order to hold that the deprivation or infringement of an employee’s rights held under an original employment contract converts the available “other employment” relied upon by the employer to mitigate damages, into inferior employment which the employee need not seek or accept.</p>
<p class="indent">Statements found in affidavits submitted by defendant in opposition to plaintiff’s summary judgment motion, to the effect that the “Big Country” offer was not of employment different from or inferior to that under the “Bloomer Girl” contract, merely repeat the allegations of defendant’s answer to the complaint in this action, constitute only conclusionary assertions with respect to undisputed facts, and do not give rise to a triable factual issue so as to defeat the motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">In view of the determination that defendant failed to present any facts showing the existence of a factual issue with respect to its sole defense—plaintiff’s rejection of its substitute employment offer in mitigation of damages—we need not consider plaintiff’s further contention that for various reasons, including the provisions of the original contract set forth in footnote 1, <span class="italic">ante</span>, plaintiff was excused from attempting to mitigate damages.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment is affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ S<small>ULLIVAN</small>, A<small>CTING</small> C<small>HIEF</small> J<small>USTICE</small> (dissenting). The basic question in this case is whether or not plaintiff acted reasonably in rejecting defendant’s offer of alternate employment. The answer depends upon whether that offer (starring in “Big Country, Big Man”) was an offer of work that was substantially similar to her former <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page149" class="pagebreak">149</span>employment (starring in “Bloomer Girl”) or of work that was of a different or inferior kind. To my mind this is a factual issue which the trial court should not have determined on a motion for summary judgment. The majority have not only repeated this error but have compounded it by applying the rules governing mitigation of damages in the employer-employee context in a misleading fashion. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="indent">The familiar rule requiring a plaintiff in a tort or contract action to mitigate damages embodies notions of fairness and socially responsible behavior which are fundamental to our jurisprudence. Most broadly stated, it precludes the recovery of damages which, through the exercise of due diligence, could have been avoided. Thus, in essence, it is a rule requiring reasonable conduct in commercial affairs. This general principle governs the obligations of an employee after his employer has wrongfully repudiated or terminated the employment contract. Rather than permitting the employee simply to remain idle during the balance of the contract period, the law requires him to make a reasonable effort to secure other employment.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_16" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-16" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> He is not obliged, however, to seek or accept any and all types of work which may be available. Only work which is in the same field and which is of the same quality need be accepted.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_17" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Over the years the courts have employed various phrases to define the type of employment which the employee, upon his wrongful discharge, is under an obligation to accept. Thus in California alone it has been held that he must accept employment which is “substantially similar”; “comparable employment”; employment “in the same general line of the first employment”; “equivalent to his prior position”; “employment in a similar capacity”; employment which is “not * * * of a different or inferior kind * * *.”</p>
<p class="indent">For reasons which are unexplained, the majority cite several of these cases yet select from among the various judicial formulations which contain one particular phrase, “Not of a different or inferior kind,” with which to analyze this case. I have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" class="pagebreak">150</span>discovered no historical or theoretical reason to adopt this phrase, which is simply a negative restatement of the affirmative standards set out in the above cases, as the exclusive standard. Indeed, its emergence is an example of the dubious phenomenon of the law responding not to rational judicial choice or changing social conditions, but to unrecognized changes in the language of opinions or legal treatises. However, the phrase is a serviceable one and my concern is not with its use as the standard but rather with what I consider its distortion.</p>
<p class="indent">The relevant language excuses acceptance only of employment which is of a <span class="italic">different kind.</span> It has never been the law that the mere existence of <span class="italic">differences between two jobs in the same field</span> is sufficient, as a matter of law, to excuse an employee wrongfully discharged from one from accepting the other in order to mitigate damages. Such an approach would effectively eliminate any obligation of an employee to attempt to minimize damage arising from a wrongful discharge. The only alternative job offer an employee would be required to accept would be an offer of his former job by his former employer.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the majority appear to hold that there was a difference “in kind” between the employment offered plaintiff in “Bloomer Girl” and that offered in “Big Country,” an examination of the opinion makes crystal clear that the majority merely point out differences between the two <span class="italic">films</span> (an obvious circumstance) and then apodictically assert that these constitute a difference in the <span class="italic">kind of employment.</span> The entire rationale of the majority boils down to this: that the “<span class="italic">mere circumstances</span>” that “Bloomer Girl” was to be a musical review while “Big Country” was a straight drama “demonstrates the difference in kind” since a female lead in a western is not “the equivalent of or substantially similar to” a lead in a musical. This is merely attempting to prove the proposition by repeating it. It shows that the vehicles for the display of the star’s talents are different but it does not prove that her employment as a star in such vehicles is of necessity different <span class="italic">in kind</span> and either inferior or superior.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that the approach taken by the majority (a superficial listing of differences with no attempt to assess their significance) may subvert a valuable legal doctrine.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_18" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-18" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup> The inquiry in cases such as this should not be whether differences between the two jobs exist (there will always be differences) but whether the differences which are present are substantial enough to constitute differences in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" class="pagebreak">151</span><span class="italic">kind</span> of employment or, alternatively, whether they render the substitute work employment of an <span class="italic">inferior kind.</span></p>
<p class="indent">It seems to me that <span class="italic">this</span> inquiry involves, in the instant case at least, factual determinations which are improper on a motion for summary judgment. Resolving whether or not one job is substantially similar to another or whether, on the other hand, it is of a different or inferior kind, will often (as here) require a critical appraisal of the similarities and differences between them in light of the importance of these differences to the employee. This necessitates a weighing of the evidence, and it is precisely this undertaking which is forbidden on summary judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that summary judgment would never be available in an action by an employee in which the employer raises the defense of failure to mitigate damages. No case has come to my attention, however, in which summary judgment has been granted on the issue of whether an employee was obliged to accept available alternate employment. Nevertheless, there may well be cases in which the substitute employment is so manifestly of a dissimilar or inferior sort, the declarations of the plaintiff so complete and those of the defendant so conclusionary and inadequate that no factual issues exist for which a trial is required. This, however, is not such a case.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not intuitively obvious, to me at least, that the leading female role in a dramatic motion picture is a radically different endeavor from the leading female role in a musical comedy film. Nor is it plain to me that the rather qualified rights of director and screenplay approval contained in the first contract are highly significant matters either in the entertainment industry in general or to this plaintiff in particular. Certainly, none of the declarations introduced by plaintiff in support of her motion shed any light on these issues.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_19" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-19" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></sup> Nor do they attempt to explain why she declined the offer of starring in “Big Country, Big Man.” Nevertheless, the trial court <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page152" class="pagebreak">152</span>granted the motion, declaring that these approval rights were “critical” and that their elimination altered “the essential nature of the employment.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, there was nothing properly before the trial court by which the importance of the approval rights could be ascertained, much less evaluated. Thus, in order to grant the motion for summary judgment, the trial court misused judicial notice. In upholding the summary judgment, the majority here rely upon per se rules which distort the process of determining whether or not an employee is obliged to accept particular employment in mitigation of damages.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that the judgment should be reversed so that the issue of whether or not the offer of the lead role in “Big Country, Big Man” was of employment comparable to that of the lead role in “Bloomer Girl” may be determined at trial….</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Ms. Parker is best known by her stage name, Shirley MacLaine. Her filmography includes scores of pictures of all genres: dramas, westerns, comedies, and musicals. But she danced in only a small minority of those films. Were her roles in those other films necessarily “different and inferior” to those she danced in—even the one in which she earned her Best Actress Academy Award (<span class="italic">Terms of Endearment</span>)? Does the majority opinion in this case properly apply the summary judgment standard it adopts? That is, do the affidavits establish that no reasonable jury could find that the second movie role is not different or inferior employment to the first?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Does someone have to do business with a dirty contract breaker to avoid consequences? Suppose Fox repudiated the contract with Parker not to abandon the project but to hire Parker’s younger arch-rival, Jennifer Lawrence? Suppose further that the deal with J-Law fell through and Fox re-extended the offer to Parker. Would Parker forfeit any right to damages if she refused a second, identical offer by Fox to do <span class="italic">Bloomer Girl</span>, even though now she neither trusts nor wants to work for Fox?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Consider the uncertainties facing a counselor advising an employee soon after breach by the employer. If you advise the worker to take another job, the earnings on that job are likely to reduce damages. Yet if you advise the worker that the available work is different and inferior, you run the risk that if a court later disagrees with your guess, damages will be reduced anyway by what the worker might have earned. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page153" class="pagebreak">153</span>In such a situation isn’t any sensible counselor going to advise the worker to take any job that comes along and seems roughly similar to the old one?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Compare the mitigation standard in <span class="italic">Parker</span> with that applied in <span class="italic">In re WorldCom, Inc.</span>, 361 B.R. 675 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2007). Michael Jordan (of Chicago Bulls fame) and MCI entered into a 10-year $20 million endorsement agreement in 1995. In 2002 MCI filed for bankruptcy. In 2003 Jordan filed a claim against MCI seeking $2 million for each of the years 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. MCI argued it was under no obligation to pay for contract years 2004 and 2005 because Jordan failed to mitigate damages by not pursuing other endorsement opportunities. Jordan replied (not unlike Parker) that he acted reasonably when he chose not to pursue other endorsement deals. But unlike the California Supreme Court, the <span class="italic">WorldCom</span> court held that Jordan’s blanket claim that seeking another endorsement deal could dilute the value of his endorsement or damage his reputation was not convincing. The court reasoned that replacing the MCI deal with another endorsement would maintain the status quo, not dilute Jordan’s endorsement value. The court did not find any support for the proposition that making a new endorsement would harm Jordan’s reputation. Aren’t the differences between various firms who might wish to promote themselves with Michael Jordan’s endorsement at least as great as the differences between <span class="italic">Bloomer Girl</span> and <span class="italic">Big Country Big Man</span>? Should Jordan have to endorse other firms’ products and services to mitigate damages because of MCI’s breach?</p>

<p class="indent">The rule as to avoidable consequences is applicable in this situation for the reason that the employee’s privilege to earn wages under a new employer is directly due to his discharge by the first employer. The discharge causes injury, but it also sets free valuable time for use in other service. This is true, and the rule is applicable, only in case the new service that the employee can obtain is of a kind that he could not properly have performed if the employer had not discharged him from the first contract.</p>
<p class="indent">If a discharged employee engages in business instead of working for wages, the profits that he makes in such an enterprise have been held to be deductible from the amount to which he would otherwise be entitled as damages. It is very doubtful whether such a deduction should ever be allowed. Even if the enterprise is of such a character that the employee could not have engaged in it except for the fact of his discharge, the business risks are such that he cannot reasonably be expected to incur them; and if he chooses to engage in the business, investing capital therein, the risk <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" class="pagebreak">154</span>of gain or loss should be his. Whether or not he goes into another business or makes a gain or loss therein, his damages should be measured by the wages promised less what he could earn by reasonable effort in a similar position of employment.</p>
<p class="indent">It has frequently been said that the employee is under a “duty” to mitigate damages by looking for other work and accepting it if it can be obtained. Accurately speaking, however, this is not the case. It makes no difference whatever whether the employee actually uses the time that is set free for his use by the employer’s discharge or does not use it. His recoverable damages are exactly the same in either case. He is legally privileged to throw away his time if he so desires.</p>
<p class="indent">The burden of proof is on the employer to show that similar employment could be obtained by reasonable effort. Any serious doubt as to whether the obtainable service is similar in a sufficient degree to that required by the broken contract is resolved against the employer.</p>
<p class="indent">There are cases in which a wrongful discharge by an employer causes other injury to the employee than the mere loss of money wages. The discharge may cause loss of opportunity to learn a trade or to acquire a valuable reputation. If such injury is caused and the employer had reason to foresee such an injury at the time that the contract of employment was made, damages are recoverable for such a consequential injury if its amount in money can be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty. The agreed wages may themselves be uncertain in amount, as where the amount to be paid for the service consisted in commissions on business to be done or in a share of the profits to be made. The employee is not refused a remedy because of this kind of uncertainty, but in his evidence he must lay a substantial basis for making an estimate of the amount that he would have received under the contract, had there been no discharge.</p>

The appeal concerns the right of a retail dealer to recover loss of profits and incidental damages upon the buyer’s repudiation of a contract governed by the Uniform Commercial Code. This is, indeed, the correct measure of damage in an appropriate case and to this extent the code (§ 2–708, subsection [2]), effected a substantial change from prior law, whereby damages were ordinarily limited to “the difference between the contract price and the market or current price.” Upon the record before us, the courts below erred in declining to give effect to the new statute and so the order appealed from must be reversed.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs contracted to purchase from defendant a new boat of a specified model for the price of $12,587.40, against which they made a deposit of $40. They shortly increased the deposit to $4,250 in consideration of the defendant dealer’s agreement to arrange with the manufacturer for immediate delivery on the basis of “a firm sale,” instead of the delivery within approximately four to six weeks originally specified. Some six days after the date of the contract plaintiffs’ lawyer sent to defendant a letter rescinding the sales contract for the reason that plaintiff Neri was about to undergo hospitalization and surgery, in consequence of which, according to the letter, it would be “impossible for Mr. Neri to make any payments.” The boat had already been ordered from the manufacturer and was delivered to defendant at or before the time the attorney’s letter was received. Defendant declined to refund plaintiffs’ deposit and this action to recover it was commenced. Defendant counterclaimed, alleging plaintiffs’ breach of the contract and defendant’s resultant damage in the amount of $4,250, for which sum defendant demanded judgment. Upon motion, defendant had summary judgment on the issue of liability tendered by its counterclaim; and Special Term directed an assessment of damages, upon which it would be determined whether plaintiffs were entitled to the return of any portion of their down payment.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon the trial so directed, it was shown that the boat ordered and received by defendant in accordance with plaintiffs’ contract of purchase was sold some four months later to another buyer for the same price as that negotiated with plaintiffs. From this proof the plaintiffs argue that defendant’s loss on its contract was recouped, while defendant argues that but for plaintiffs’ default, it would have sold two boats and have earned two profits instead of one. Defendant proved, without <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page156" class="pagebreak">156</span>contradiction, that its profit on the sale under the contract in suit would have been $2,579 and that during the period the boat remained unsold incidental expenses aggregating $674 for storage, upkeep, finance charges and insurance were incurred. Additionally, defendant proved and sought to recover attorneys’ fees of $1,250.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court found “untenable” defendant’s claim for loss of profit, inasmuch as the boat was later sold for the same price that plaintiffs had contracted to pay; found, too, that defendant had failed to prove any incidental damages; further found “that the terms of section 2–718, subsection 2(b), of the Uniform Commercial Code are applicable and same make adequate and fair provision to place the sellers in as good a position as performance would have done” and, in accordance with paragraph (b) of subsection (2) thus relied upon, awarded defendant $500 upon its counterclaim and directed that plaintiffs recover the balance of their deposit, amounting to $3,750. The ensuing judgment was affirmed, without opinion, at the Appellate Division, and defendant’s appeal to this court was taken by our leave.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue is governed in the first instance by section 2–718 of the Uniform Commercial Code which provides, among other things, that the buyer, despite his breach, may have restitution of the amount by which his payment exceeds: (a) reasonable liquidated damages stipulated by the contract or (b) absent such stipulation, 20% of the value of the buyer’s total performance or $500, whichever is smaller (§ 2–718, subsection [2], pars. [a], [b]). As above noted, the trial court awarded defendant an offset in the amount of $500 under paragraph (b) and directed restitution to plaintiffs of the balance. Section 2–718, however, establishes, in paragraph (a) of subsection (3), an alternative right of offset in favor of the seller, as follows: “(3) The buyer’s right to restitution under subsection (2) is subject to offset to the extent that the seller establishes (a) a right to recover damages under the provisions of this Article other than subsection (1).”</p>
<p class="indent">Among “the provisions of this Article other than subsection (1)” are those to be found in section 2–708, which the courts below did not apply. Subsection (1) of that section provides that “the measure of damages for non-acceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in this Article (Section 2–710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer’s breach.” However, this provision is made expressly subject to subsection (2), providing: “(2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this Article (Section 2–710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page157" class="pagebreak">157</div>
<p class="indent">It is evident, first, that this retail seller is entitled to its profit and, second, that the last sentence of subsection (2), as hereinbefore quoted, referring to “due credit for payments or proceeds of resale” is inapplicable to this retail sales contract. Closely parallel to the factual situation now before us is that hypothesized by Dean Hawkland as illustrative of the operation of the rules:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Thus, if a private party agrees to sell his automobile to a buyer for $2,000, a breach by the buyer would cause the seller no loss (except incidental damages, i.e., expense of a new sale) if the seller was able to sell the automobile to another buyer for $2,000. But the situation is different with dealers having an unlimited supply of standard-priced goods. Thus, if an automobile dealer agrees to sell a car to a buyer at the standard price of $2,000, a breach by the buyer injures the dealer, even though he is able to sell the automobile to another for $2,000. If the dealer has an inexhaustible supply of cars, the resale to replace the breaching buyer costs the dealer a sale, because, had the breaching buyer performed, the dealer would have made two sales instead of one. The buyer’s breach, in such a case, depletes the dealer’s sales to the extent of one, and the measure of damages should be the dealer’s profit on one sale….</p>
<p class="indent">It follows that plaintiffs are entitled to restitution of the sum of $4,250 paid by them on account of the contract price less an offset to defendant in the amount of $3,253 on account of its lost profit of $2,579 and its incidental damages of $674.</p>
<p id="sec84" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Isn’t a “middleman” seller’s damage almost always his “lost profit”? What is he in business for—to dispose of one lot of goods or to make as many sales as he can? Does the fact, then, that he can sell an article again after he has lost its first sale make him whole? Couldn’t he have made the second sale, too, thus making two profits, if the first buyer hadn’t breached? How can he possibly “avoid consequences”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Assume Retail Marine, after Neri’s breach, had sold the boat that Neri had contracted for to another dealer at cost and then claimed the difference between contract and its resale price. Would you feel better about the result if the court gave Retail Marine that difference?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. UCC § 2-708(2) appears to require “due credit for payment or proceeds of resale” in calculating lost profit damages. If the resale price equals the contract price, doesn’t duly crediting sale proceeds eliminate any damages? <span class="italic">See</span> John Breen, <span class="italic">The Lost Volume Seller and Lost Profits Under 2-708(2): A Conceptual and Linguistic Critique</span>, 50 U. M<small>IAMI</small> L. R<small>EV</small>. 779 (1996).</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page158" class="pagebreak">158</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. What if the market price actually went up during the period? Does Retail Marine still suffer loss of profit anticipated on its sale to Neri?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Recall <span class="italic">Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Company</span>, p. 139. If Luten Bridge Company had stopped construction of the bridge when notified of the county’s repudiation, would the damages that it should receive be influenced by its efforts to mitigate damages in seeking alternative work? Is the answer the same whether Luten Bridge Company is just old man Luten who can only build one bridge at a time or a large firm able to manage twenty projects at the same time?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. It is unclear whether retailers in competitive markets actually suffer lost profits from buyers’ wrongful refusals to accept and pay for goods in the absence of a change in market price. The problem of the “lost volume seller” has long been a favorite analytical exercise for economists and their fellow travelers in the legal academy. For a summary of the various approaches to the problem see Robert Scott, <span class="italic">The Case for Market Damages: Revisiting the Lost Profits Puzzle</span>, 57 U. C<small>HI</small>. L.

<p class="indent">A major theme throughout your legal education will be the interrelation of substantive rules of liability and the procedural rules which establish how disputes are heard and resolved. Procedural rules often determine the reality and the content of substantive rules. Traditional pleading rules and habits have had a particularly substantial impact on contract damage rules. As a matter of pleading, some kinds of damages need only be stated generally to be recoverable. The plaintiff merely pleads a cause of action and then demands judgment in the sum of X-dollars, without having to specify just how that figure was computed. Under such an allegation, plaintiff may proceed to prove its damages for those kinds of losses that are always available under such a claim.</p>
<p class="indent">These damages are referred to as general damages, and the rationale for allowing them is that it is clearly foreseeable that this type of damage will occur if the contract is breached, despite the best efforts of the injured party to avoid them. There is no need under the pleading rules to give the defendant notice as to these damages because everyone knows such elements are part of the story. The difference between market and contract price in the sale of goods case is an example of a loss that can always be proved under a general damage pleading.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page159" class="pagebreak">159</div>
<p class="indent">But there are other kinds of losses that a plaintiff may recover only if it pleads them specially in a specific allegation. These are called special damages and are typified by the consequential damage a disappointed party suffers, such as a loss of customers or lost profits or damages to property caused by a breach.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether a particular item of damages is general or special is primarily a matter of custom and can only be answered with assurance in any given case by looking to see how such matters are pled in the relevant jurisdiction. But these pleading habits are too deeply ingrained in the law to be ignored, and they continue to be applied under modern pleading rules. <span class="italic">See, e.g.</span>, F<small>ED</small>. R. C<small>IV</small>. P. 9(g).</p>
<p class="indent">Our tradition of trial by jury in civil cases also has influenced the development of contract damage rules. Historically, questions of damages were treated primarily as issues of fact to be decided by the jury, rather than matters of law for the trial judge. Appellate courts came to discuss damage issues relatively late in history and still do so only rarely. The first few paragraphs of Baron Alderson’s opinion in <span class="italic">Hadley v. Baxendale</span>, which follows, reflect that as late as 1854 it was felt necessary to defend the idea that an appellate court should announce rules to guide the jury in such matters.</p>
<p class="indent">Although there is no longer any dispute that damage computations are the appropriate subject for legal rules, useful statements of such rules are still hard to find. One major reason is the procedural context in which these questions are likely to arise. The issue of damages is left to the jury, and the instructions the trial judge will give the jury are likely to be vague and general. Under typical procedural rules, the jury does not state how it arrived at its damage award; its verdict typically announces merely, “We find for the plaintiff in the sum of X dollars.” In most cases, there will be a variety of evidence that the jury was free to accept or reject in deciding a case and in computing damages. Moreover, the common experience is that the jury’s computations are very mysterious things, and the arithmetic often will not match precisely any obvious view of the evidence. The appellate court called upon to review such a verdict will likely be unable to determine how the jury computed the damages and whether it used an appropriate legal standard.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if it appears that something is wrong somewhere with the jury’s computations, the court is often reluctant to intervene and send the case back for a new trial that may cost more than the dollar difference between the jury’s verdict and correctly computed damages. Practically speaking most appellate courts leave damages to the rough judgment of the finder of fact except in the most egregious cases.</p>

<p class="indent">A more practical advantage in looking at a contract as the taking of a risk is to be found in the light which it throws upon the measure of damages. If a breach of contract were regarded in the same light as a tort, it would seem that if, in the course of performance of the contract the promisor should be notified of any particular consequence which would result from its not being performed, he should be held liable for that consequence in the event of non-performance. Such a suggestion has been made. But it has not been accepted as the law. On the contrary, according to the opinion of a very able judge, which seems to be generally followed, notice, even at the time of making the contract, of special circumstances out of which special damages would arise in case of breach, is not sufficient unless the assumption of that risk is to be taken as having fairly entered into the contract.</p>
<p id="sec87" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Hadley v. Baxendale</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Court of Exchequer, 1854.</p>
<p class="sectionb">9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng.Rep. 145.</p>
<p class="indent">At the trial before Crompton, J., at the last Gloucester Assizes, it appeared that the plaintiffs carried on an extensive business as millers at Gloucester; and that on the 11th of May, their mill was stopped by a breakage of the crank shaft by which the mill was worked. The steam-engine was manufactured by Messrs. Joyce &amp; Co., the engineers, at Greenwich, and it became necessary to send the shaft as a pattern for a new one to Greenwich. The fracture was discovered on the 12th, and on the 13th the plaintiffs sent one of their servants to the office of the defendants, who are the well-known carriers trading under the name of Pickford &amp; Co., for the purpose of having the shaft carried to Greenwich. The plaintiffs’ servant told the clerk that the mill was stopped, and that the shaft must be sent immediately; and in answer to the inquiry when the shaft would be taken, the answer was, that if it was sent up by twelve o’clock any day, it would be delivered at Greenwich on the following day. On the following day the shaft was taken by the defendants, before noon, for the purpose of being conveyed to Greenwich, and the sum of 2<span class="italic">l.</span> 4<span class="italic">s.</span> was paid for its carriage for the whole distance; at the same time the defendants’ clerk was told that a special entry, if required, should be made to hasten its delivery. The delivery of the shaft at Greenwich was delayed by some neglect; and the consequence was, that the plaintiffs did not receive the new shaft for several days after they would otherwise have done, and the working of their mill was thereby delayed, and they thereby lost the profits they would otherwise have received.</p>
<p class="indent">On the part of the defendants, it was objected that these damages were too remote, and that the defendants were not liable with respect to them. The learned Judge left the case generally to the jury, who found a verdict with £25 damages beyond the amount paid into Court.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page161" class="pagebreak">161</div>
<p class="indent">Whateley, in last Michaelmas Term, obtained a rule nisi for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ A<small>LDERSON</small>, B. We think that there ought to be a new trial in this case; but, in so doing, we deem it to be expedient and necessary to state explicitly the rule which the Judge, at the next trial, ought, in our opinion, to direct the jury to be governed by when they estimate the damages.</p>
<p class="indent">It is, indeed, of the last importance that we should do this; for, if the jury are left without any definite rule to guide them, it will, in such cases as these, manifestly lead to the greatest injustice. The Courts have done this on several occasions; and, in <span class="italic">Blake v. Midland Railway Company</span>, 18 Q.B. 93, the Court granted a new trial on this very ground, that the rule had not been definitely laid down to the jury by the learned Judge at Nisi Prius.</p>
<p class="indent">“There are certain established rules,” this Court says, in <span class="italic">Alder v. Keighley</span>, 15 M. &amp; W. 117, “according to which the jury ought to find.” And the Court, in that case, adds: “and here there is a clear rule, that the amount which would have been received if the contract had been kept, is the measure of damages if the contract is broken.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now we think the proper rule in such a case as the present is this:—Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it. Now, if the special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated. But, on the other hand, if these special circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, he, at the most, could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally, and in the great multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">For, had the special circumstances been known, the parties might have specially provided for the breach of contract by special terms as to the damages in that case; and of this advantage it would be very unjust to deprive them. Now the above principles are those by which we think the jury ought to be guided in estimating the damages arising out of any breach of contract. It is said, that other cases such as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" class="pagebreak">162</span>breaches of contract in the nonpayment of money, or in the not making a good title to land, are to be treated as exceptions from this, and as governed by a conventional rule. But as, in such cases, both parties must be supposed to be cognizant of that well-known rule, these cases may, we think, be more properly classed under the rule above enunciated as to cases under known special circumstances, because there both parties may reasonably be presumed to contemplate the estimation of the amount of damages according to the conventional rule. Now, in the present case, if we are to apply the principles above laid down, we find that the only circumstances here communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants at the time the contract was made, were, that the article to be carried was the broken shaft of a mill, and that the plaintiffs were the millers of that mill.</p>
<p class="indent">But how do these circumstances shew reasonably that the profits of the mill must be stopped by an unreasonable delay in the delivery of the broken shaft by the carrier to the third person? Suppose the plaintiffs had another shaft in their possession put up or putting up at the time, and that they only wished to send back the broken shaft to the engineer who made it; it is clear that this would be quite consistent with the above circumstances, and yet the unreasonable delay in the delivery would have no effect upon the intermediate profits of the mill. Or, again, suppose that, at the time of the delivery to the carrier, the machinery of the mill had been in other respects defective, then, also, the same results would follow. Here it is true that the shaft was actually sent back to serve as a model for a new one, and that the want of a new one was the only cause of the stoppage of the mill, and that the loss of profits really arose from not sending down the new shaft in proper time, and that this arose from the delay in delivering the broken one to serve as a model. But it is obvious that, in the great multitude of cases of millers sending off broken shafts to third persons by a carrier under ordinary circumstances, such consequences would not, in all probability, have occurred; and these special circumstances were here never communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants. It follows therefore, that the loss of profits here cannot reasonably be considered such a consequence of the breach of contract as could have been fairly and reasonably contemplated by both the parties when they made this contract. For such loss would neither have flowed naturally from the breach of this contract in the great multitude of such cases occurring under ordinary circumstances, nor were the special circumstances, which, perhaps, would have made it a reasonable and natural consequence of such breach of contract, communicated to or known by the defendants. The Judge ought, therefore, to have told the jury that, upon the facts then before them they ought not to take the loss of profits into consideration at all in estimating the damages. There must therefore be a new trial in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">Rule absolute.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" class="pagebreak">163</div>
<p id="sec88" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. If the plaintiff cannot recover for the “lost profits” caused by the mill’s shutdown for the period of the delayed delivery, what damages can it recover? Does a crankshaft have a pure use-value as such? If not, what general damages can be said to flow from a breach such as this one?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If Hadley’s employee had served notice, would Hadley have made its case that special circumstance had been communicated and that it was therefore entitled to consequential damages? Were <span class="italic">Hadley</span> litigated today, would comment <span class="italic">f</span> to Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 351 justify the same outcome?</p>
<p class="blockquotei1"><span class="italic">f.    Other Limitations on Damages.</span> It is not always in the interest of justice to require the party in breach to pay damages for all of the foreseeable loss that he has caused. There are unusual instances in which it appears from the circumstances either that the parties assumed that one of them would not bear the risk of a particular loss or that, although there was no such assumption, it would be unjust to put the risk on that party. One such circumstance is an extreme disproportion between the loss and the price charged by the party whose liability for that loss is in question. The fact that the price is relatively small suggests that it was not intended to cover the risk of such liability. Another such circumstance is an informality of dealing, including the absence of a detailed written contract, which indicates that there was no careful attempt to allocate all of the risks. The fact that the parties did not attempt to delineate with precision all of the risks justifies a court in attempting to allocate them fairly. The limitations dealt with in this Section are more likely to be imposed in connection with contracts that do not arise in a commercial setting. Typical examples of limitations imposed on damages under this discretionary power involve the denial of recovery for loss of profits and the restriction of damages to loss incurred in reliance on the contract. Sometimes these limits are covertly imposed, by means of an especially demanding requirement of foreseeability or of certainty. The rule stated in this Section recognizes that what is done in such cases is the imposition of a limitation in the interests of justice.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The facts recited in the case report state that the carrier’s failure to deliver the shaft on time was the result of some neglect. Why couldn’t Hadley have recovered on a tort theory? Suppose that the defendant was an expert shaft engineer who carelessly repaired the shaft. Would you be more likely to say either “that’s a tort” or at least that losses from careless repair were in the contemplation of the parties?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page164" class="pagebreak">164</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The defining limits placed upon contract damages by the rule in <span class="italic">Hadley v. Baxendale</span> was timely, for this case arose as the industrial revolution was transforming life in England. The case can be understood in historical context as a mark of the ascendency of the capitalist class, which was heavily dependent on limited liability of new corporate enterprises for their contracts to enable capitalists to calculate with greater assurance the expected return on their investments. More specifically, <span class="italic">Hadley</span> is a carrier case and announces a rule highly important to the various new means of communications and transportation that were emerging. Post, telegraph, railroads and steamships were making cheap mass communications possible. But a common carrier cannot routinely carry parcels and letters bearing penny stamps for great distances if loss of the item carried might impose liability for all conceivable consequences. The burden of loss is more efficiently shifted to insurance obtained by the shipper, who knows of and can protect itself against such losses. <span class="italic">Hadley</span> thus moved the law of damages into a new age in which the liabilities of enterprises in general, and of carriers in particular, for consequences of the contract breach were held to manageable levels.</p>

<p class="indentn">This is an action of contract brought by the plaintiff in error, a Kentucky corporation, against the defendant in error, a Texas corporation, for breach of a contract to sell and deliver crude oil. The defendant excepted to certain allegations of damage, and pleaded that the damages had been claimed and magnified fraudulently for the purpose of giving the United States circuit court jurisdiction, when in truth they were less than $2,000. The judge sustained the exceptions. He also tried the question of jurisdiction before hearing the merits, refused the plaintiff a jury, found that the plea was sustained, and dismissed the cause. The plaintiff excepted to all the rulings and action of the court, and brings the case here by writ of error. If the rulings and findings were right, there is no question that the judge was right in dismissing the suit; but the grounds upon which he went are re-examinable here.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract was made through a broker, it would seem by writing, and, at all events, was admitted to be correctly stated in the following letter:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page165" class="pagebreak">165</div>
<p class="blockquotes">Dallas, Texas, 7/30/97. Landa Oil Company, New Braunfels, Texas.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Gentlemen:</p>
<p class="blockquote_indl">Referring to the exchange of our telegrams to-day, we have sold for your account to the Globe Refining Company, Louisville, Kentucky, ten (10) tanks prime crude C/S oil at the price of 15¾ cents per gallon of 7½ pounds, f.o.b. buyers’ tank at your mill. Weights and quality guaranteed.</p>
<p class="blockquote_indl">Terms: Sight draft without exchange b/ldg. attached. Sellers paying commission.</p>
<p class="blockquote_indl">Shipment: Part last half August and balance first half September. Shipping instructions to be furnished by the Globe Refining Company.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Thomas &amp; Green, as Broker</p>
<p class="indent">Having this contract before us, we proceed to consider the allegations of special damage over and above the difference between the contract price of the oil and the price at the time of the breach, which was the measure adopted by the judge. These allegations must be read with care, for it is obvious that the pleader has gone as far as he dared to go, and to the verge of anything that could be justified under the contract, if not beyond.</p>
<p class="indent">It is alleged that it was agreed and understood that the plaintiff would send its tank cars to the defendant’s mills, and that the defendant promptly would fill them with oil (so far, simply following the contract), and that the plaintiff sent tanks. “In order to do this, the plaintiff was under the necessity of obligating itself unconditionally to the railroad company (and of which the defendant had notice) to pay to it for the transportation of the cars from said Louisville to said New Braunfels in the sum of $900,” which sum plaintiff had to pay, “and was incurred as an advancement on said oil contract.” This is the first item. The last words quoted mean only that the sum paid would have been allowed by the railroad as part payment of the return charges had the tanks been filled and sent back over the same road.</p>
<p class="indent">Next it is alleged that the defendant, contemplating a breach of the contract, caused the plaintiff to send its cars a thousand miles, at a cost of $1,000; that defendant canceled its contract on the 2d of September, but did not notify the plaintiff until the 14th, when, if the plaintiff had known of the cancellation, it would have been supplying itself from other sources; that plaintiff (no doubt defendant is meant) did so wilfully and maliciously, causing an unnecessary loss of $2,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Next it is alleged that, by reason of the breach of contract and want of notice, plaintiff lost the use of its tanks for thirty days,—a loss estimated at $700 more. Next it is alleged that the plaintiff had arranged with its own customers to furnish the oil in question within a certain time, which contemplated sharp compliance with the contract by the defendant; “all of which facts, as above stated were well known to the defendant and defendant had contracted to that end with the plaintiff.” This <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page166" class="pagebreak">166</span>item is put at $740, with $1,000 more for loss of customers, credit, and reputation. Finally, at the end of the petition, it is alleged generally that it was known to defendant, and in contemplation of the contract, that plaintiff would have to send tanks at great expense from distant points, and that plaintiff “was required to pay additional freight in order to rearrange the destination of the various tanks and other points.” Then it is alleged that by reason of the defendant’s breach, the plaintiff had to pay $350 additional freight.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever may be the scope of the allegations which we have quoted, it will be seen that none of the items was contemplated expressly by the words of the bargain. Those words are before us in writing, and go no further than to contemplate that when the deliveries were to take place the buyer’s tanks should be at the defendant’s mill. Under such circumstances the question is suggested how far the express terms of a writing, admitted to be complete, can be enlarged by averment and oral evidence; and, if they can be enlarged in that way, what averments are sufficient. When a man commits a tort, he incurs, by force of the law, a liability to damages, measured by certain rules. When a man makes a contract, he incurs, by force of the law, a liability to damages, unless a certain promised event comes to pass. But, unlike the case of torts, as the contract is by mutual consent, the parties themselves, expressly or by implication, fix the rule by which the damages are to be measured. The old law seems to have regarded it as technically in the election of the promisor to perform or to pay damages. It is true that, as people when contracting contemplate performance, not breach, they commonly say little or nothing as to what shall happen in the latter event, and the common rules have been worked out by common sense, which has established what the parties probably would have said if they had spoken about the matter. But a man never can be absolutely certain of performing any contract when the time of performance arrives, and, in many cases, he obviously is taking the risk of an event which is wholly, or to an appreciable extent, beyond his control. The extent of liability in such cases is likely to be within his contemplation, and, whether it is or not, should be worked out on terms which it fairly may be presumed he would have assented to if they had been presented to his mind. For instance, in the present case, the defendant’s mill and all its oil might have been burned before the time came for delivery. Such a misfortune would not have been an excuse, although probably it would have prevented performance of the contract. If a contract is broken, the measure of damages generally is the same, whatever the cause of the breach. We have to consider, therefore, what the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover in that case, and that depends on what liability the defendant fairly may be supposed to have assumed consciously, or to have warranted the plaintiff reasonably to suppose that it assumed, when the contract was made.</p>
<p class="indent">This point of view is taken by implication in the rule that “a person can only be held to be responsible for such consequences as may be reasonably supposed to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page167" class="pagebreak">167</span>in the contemplation of the parties at the time of making the contract.” The suggestion thrown out by Bramwell, B., in <span class="italic">Gee v. Lancashire &amp; Y.R. Co.</span>, 6 Hurlst. &amp; N. 211, 218, that perhaps notice after the contract was made and before breach would be enough, is not accepted by the later decisions. The consequences must be contemplated at the time of the making of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The question arises, then, What is sufficient to show that the consequences were in contemplation of the parties, in the sense of the vendor taking the risk? It has been held that it may be proved by oral evidence when the contract is in writing. But, in the language quoted, with seeming approbation, by Blackburn, J., from Mayne on Damages, 2d ed. 10, in <span class="italic">Elbinger Actien–Gesellschafft v. Armstrong</span>, L.R. 9 Q.B. 473, 478, “it may be asked, with great deference, whether the mere fact of such consequences being communicated to the other party will be sufficient, without going on to show that he was told that he would be answerable for them, and consented to undertake such a liability.” Mr. Justice Willes answered this question, so far as it was in his power, in <span class="italic">British Columbia &amp; V.I. Spar, Lumber, &amp; Saw–Mill Co. v. Nettleship</span>, L.R. 3 C.P. 499, 500:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">I am disposed to take the narrow view that one of two contracting parties ought not to be allowed to obtain an advantage which he has not paid for. * * * If that [a liability for the full profits that might be made by machinery which the defendant was transporting, if the plaintiff’s trade should prove successful and without a rival] had been presented to the mind of the ship owner at the time of making the contract, as the basis upon which he was contracting, he would at once have rejected it. And though he knew, from the shippers, the use they intended to make of the articles, it could not be contended that the mere fact of knowledge, without more, would be a reason for imposing upon him a greater degree of liability than would otherwise have been cast upon him. To my mind, that leads to the inevitable conclusion that the mere fact of knowledge cannot increase the liability. The knowledge must be brought home to the party sought to be charged, under such circumstances that he must know that the person he contracts with reasonably believes that he accepts the contract with the special condition attached to it.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be said with safety that mere notice to a seller of some interest or probable action of the buyer is not enough necessarily and as matter of law to charge the seller with special damage on that account if he fails to deliver the goods. With that established, we recur to the allegations. With regard to the first, it is obvious that the plaintiff was free to bring its tanks from where it liked,—a thousand miles away or an adjoining yard,—so far as the contract was concerned. The allegation hardly amounts to saying that the defendant had notice that the plaintiff was likely to send its cars from a distance. It is not alleged that the defendant had notice that the plaintiff had to bind itself to pay $900, at the time when the contract was made, and it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page168" class="pagebreak">168</span>nowhere is alleged that the defendant assumed any liability in respect of this uncertain element of charge. The same observations may be made with regard to the claim for loss of use of the tanks and to the final allegations as to sending the tanks from distant points. It is true that this last was alleged to have been in contemplation of the contract, if we give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt in construing a somewhat confused sentence. But, having the contract before us, we can see that this ambiguous expression cannot be taken to mean more than notice, and notice of a fact which would depend upon the accidents of the future.</p>
<p class="indent">It is to be said further, with regard to the foregoing items, that they were the expenses which the plaintiff was willing to incur for performance. If it had received the oil, there were deductions from any profit which the plaintiff would have made. But, if it gets the difference between the contract price and the market price, it gets what represents the value of the oil in its hands, and to allow these items in addition would be making the defendant pay twice for the same thing.</p>
<p class="indent">It must not be forgotten that we are dealing with pleadings, not evidence, and with pleadings which, as we have said, evidently put the plaintiff’s case as high as it possibly can be put. There are no inferences to be drawn, and therefore cases like <span class="italic">Hammond v. Bussey,</span> L.R. 20 Q.B.Div. 79, do not apply. It is a simple question of allegations which, by declining to amend, the plaintiff has admitted that it cannot reinforce. This consideration applies with special force to the attempt to hold the defendant liable for the breach of the plaintiff’s contract with third persons. The allegation is that the fact that the plaintiff had contracts over was well known to the defendant, and that “defendant had contracted to that end with the plaintiff.” Whether, if we were sitting as a jury, this would warrant an inference that the defendant assumed an additional liability, we need not consider. It is enough to say that it does not allege the conclusion of fact so definitely that it must be assumed to be true. With the contract before us it is in a high degree improbable that any such conclusion could have been made good.</p>
<p class="indent">The only other allegation needing to be dealt with is that the defendant maliciously caused the plaintiff to send the tanks a thousand miles, contemplating a breach of its contract. So far as this item has not been answered by what has been said, it is necessary only to add a few words. The fact alleged has no relation to the time of the contract. Therefore it cannot affect the damages, the measure of which was fixed at that time. The motive for the breach commonly is immaterial in an action on the contract. It is in this case. Whether, under any circumstances, it might give rise to an action of tort, is not material here.</p>
<p class="indent">The allowance of the exceptions made the trial of the plea superfluous. If the question of fact was to be tried as to whether the amount of damages that fairly could be claimed was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction, the court had authority to try it. In coming to his conclusion, apart from what was apparent on the face of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page169" class="pagebreak">169</span>pleadings, the judge no doubt was influenced largely by a letter from the plaintiff to the defendant, inclosing an itemized bill for $1,021.28. This letter suggested no further claim except for “any additional mileage we may have to pay.” Of course, if the judge accepted the plaintiff’s own view of its case as expressed here, the pretence of jurisdiction was at an end. Some attempt was made to make out this was an offer of compromise, and inadmissible. But the letter did not purport to be anything of the sort; it was an out and out adverse demand.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec90" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The price of the oil in this case was quoted “F.O.B.” or “free-on-board.” This means that the seller was obligated under this contract to load the oil on buyer’s railroad cars and that the contract price therefore included the price of the goods plus the cost of lading. The cost of transportation from seller’s mill to buyer’s place of business was not included in the price and was the buyer’s responsibility. Other common sale terms are “F.A.S.” or “free-along-side” which indicates that lading and shipping are both buyer’s responsibility and the price includes only the cost of the goods themselves which are to be delivered alongside buyer’s ship, truck or car, and “C&amp;F” or “cost of goods and freight” which indicates that the seller will deliver the goods to buyer at its place of business and the price includes cost of goods, lading and shipping.

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Was other cottonseed oil available to the buyer at or near New Braunfels? If so, and if it refused to buy it, choosing instead to bring its tank cars back to Louisville empty, was its inability to collect for freight and car rental due to lack of “notice” to seller that it was sending cars to New Braunfels, or to its failure to mitigate damages by making a substitute purchase so as to put the cars to use?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. What is buyer’s “cost” on this oil? If it is the F.O.B. mill price plus transportation to his place of business, does giving him the cost of additional transportation to and from the next available source of oil give him a double recovery?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. If Justice Holmes had adopted the following formula as the measure of damages in the case—“The difference between the cost of oil at New Braunfels plus transportation to Louisville and the cost of oil at the nearest available market plus transportation to Louisville, plus so much of the transport already paid by the buyer as was rendered useless by the seller’s breach”—would he have equally well disposed of most of the elements of buyer’s claimed damages?</p>

<p class="noindent-squ1">■ J<small>OHNSON</small>, J. Defendants appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiff for breach of a franchise agreement. In what apparently is a case of first impression not only in California but the entire nation we consider whether a franchisee’s failure to timely pay some past royalty fees entitles a franchisor to both terminate the franchise agreement and receive an award of over seven years in “future lost royalties.” We conclude the franchisee’s breach was not the “proximate” or “natural and direct” cause of the franchisor’s loss of future royalties in this case. Furthermore, in the circumstances of this case, these damages are “excessive,” “oppressive,” and “disproportionate” to the loss. Accordingly we hold these lost future royalties are not a proper element of contract damages in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. F<small>ACTS AND</small> P<small>ROCEEDINGS</small> B<small>ELOW</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Respondent and plaintiff Postal Instant Press, Inc. (PIP) is an internationally known franchisor of printing businesses. In 1979 PIP entered into a 20–year franchise agreement with appellants and defendants, Sue and Steve Sealy (collectively the Sealys). PIP agreed to provide its trademark and certain services to the Sealys in exchange for royalty fees of 6 percent of gross revenues and advertising fees of 1 percent of gross. According to the franchise agreement the Sealys were to pay these fees to PIP monthly.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page171" class="pagebreak">171</div>
<p class="indent">Among its other terms, the lengthy franchise agreement also lists a number of possible failures on the part of the franchisee, any one of which would constitute a “material breach.” In the event the franchisee commits a “material breach” the franchisor is entitled to “[t]erminate this Agreement, and thereafter bring such action * * * and to recover such damages, including but not limited to the benefit of its bargain hereunder * * * .” One of these “material breaches” is any failure to make a monthly royalty or advertising fee within ten days after notice it is unpaid.</p>
<p class="indent">This 20–year franchise agreement remained in effect for almost 13 years. In the late 1980’s, however, the Sealys failed to timely make several of their monthly royalty and advertising fee payments. The Sealys paid some of these fees late and PIP negotiated a note with the Sealys covering other overdue payments. Then in 1991, the Sealys again failed to make several of these regular payments and fell delinquent on the note as well. Ultimately, on January 22, 1992, PIP declared the overdue payments for past royalties constituted a material breach and sent the Sealys a termination letter. In pertinent part this letter advises the Sealys:</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt1">You are no longer authorized to hold yourself out as a Postal Instant Press (“PIP”) franchisee, to hold out your business as a PIP store, to conduct business under the PIP name, to perform any act that might tend to give the public the impression that you are operating a PIP Store, to use any of the PIP trade and service marks * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">Elsewhere this termination letter warns the Sealys to “Cease * * * Immediately” conducting any operation as a print shop and refers to a noncompete clause found in Paragraph VIII of the agreement. (Respondent concedes this “non-compete” clause is invalid under public policy and does not seek to enforce it in this case).</p>
<p class="indent">One month later, on February 28, 1992, PIP filed a breach of contract action against the Sealys. In this action, PIP sought $77,300 in unpaid past royalties (including the sum which had been reduced to a note) along with interest, attorney fees and costs. In addition, the franchisor sought “future royalties and payments for the remaining unfulfilled term of the Franchise Agreement in the principal amount of at least $495,699.”</p>
<p class="indent">After a bench trial, the court awarded PIP a total of $432,510.35 plus prejudgment interest, attorney fees, and expenses and costs. The court measured the expectation damage award according to unpaid royalty and advertising fund contributions from the date of termination through the remainder of the contract term, a period of seven and one-half years. Based upon defendants’ sales history, sales figures from 1990 and 1991 were averaged and, without applying any inflation or growth factor, PIP deducted its incremental costs of performance and discounted the amount to present value or $301,334. Thus, the “estimated future profits” damages represent over two-thirds of the total judgment.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page172" class="pagebreak">172</div>
<p class="indent">Appellants do not dispute the portion of the judgment representing damages for past royalty and advertising fees they owe and thus those damages are not a part of this appeal. However, appellants do challenge the trial court’s award of unpaid future royalty and advertising fees for the remaining term of the Franchise Agreement, a period of almost eight years. This portion of the award is $301,344 and is the subject of this appeal.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II.</span></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">B<small>REACH OF</small> C<small>ONTRACT</small> D<small>AMAGES FOR</small> “L<small>OST</small> F<small>UTURE</small> E<small>XPECTED</small> P<small>ROFITS</small>”<small> ARE</small> L<small>IMITED TO</small> T<small>HOSE THE</small> L<small>OSS OF</small> W<small>HICH ARE</small> “P<small>ROXIMATELY</small> C<small>AUSED</small>”<small> AND A</small> “N<small>ATURAL AND</small> D<small>IRECT</small> C<small>ONSEQUENCE</small>”<small> OF THE</small> D<small>EFENDANT</small>’<small>S</small> B<small>REACH</small> I<small>TSELF</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Under general contract principles, when one party breaches a contract the other party ordinarily is entitled to damages sufficient to make that party “whole,” that is, enough to place the non-breaching party in the same position as if the breach had not occurred. This includes future profits the breach prevented the non-breaching party from earning at least to the extent those future profits can be estimated with reasonable certainty.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court ruled that under these general contract principles PIP was entitled to estimated future royalties this franchisor would have earned in the coming year. This period extended from the time its franchisee, the Sealys, breached the franchise contract by failing to timely make certain royalty payments until the end of the term of this contract, a duration of almost eight years. We disagree. In so ruling, the trial court overlooked an important limitation embedded in the general rule.</p>
<p class="indent">Under contract principles, the non-breaching party is entitled to recover only those damages, including lost future profits, which are “proximately caused” by the specific breach. 1 Witkin, Summary of California Law (9th ed.), Contracts, § 815 [“It is essential to establish a causal connection between the breach and the damages sought.”] Or, to put it another way, the breaching party is only liable to place the non-breaching party in the same position as if the specific breach had not occurred. Or, to phrase it still a third way, the breaching party is only responsible to give the non-breaching party the benefit of the bargain to the extent the specific breach deprived that party of its bargain.</p>
<p class="indent">In the context of franchisor-franchisee relationships, this principle is illustrated by cases from other jurisdictions awarding parties future profits when the breach itself prevented the party from earning those profits. In most of these cases it is the franchisor who breached and the franchisee who is collecting damages. For example, if the franchisor wrongfully terminates the franchise, courts have held the franchisee entitled to the future profits it would have earned had the franchise remained in effect. Similarly, if the franchisor fails to provide clear title to its trademark so the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page173" class="pagebreak">173</span>franchisee cannot sell the franchised product or service, courts have held the franchisee is entitled to the profits it would have earned on sales of that product or service during the term of the franchise agreement. Once again, if the franchisor wrongfully terminates a product line, courts have awarded the franchisee the future profits it would have earned on sales of the discontinued product.</p>
<p class="indent">In the above cases, it is easy to determine the lost profits were a “natural and direct consequence of the breach.” Because the franchisor in these cases committed breaches which directly prevented the franchisee from earning the profits it reasonably could have expected to have earned under the contract, the franchisee is entitled to those lost profits as damages. Notably, however, at least one appellate court refused to award lost future profits in a franchise context because it deemed such damages too speculative.</p>
<p class="indent">As mentioned earlier, we have found no cases in any jurisdiction, however, holding “lost future profit” damages for the type of breach involved in the instant case. Here the franchisee breached the franchise contract by failing to timely make some past royalty payments. There is a “natural and direct” causal connection between the franchisee’s breaches and the loss of those past royalty payments. As a direct result of these breaches the franchisor lost those past royalty payments. To be made “whole” or in the other terminology, to gain the “benefit of its bargain” the franchisor must receive those past, unpaid royalty payments.</p>
<p class="indent">But the franchisee’s failure to timely make these past royalty payments is not a “natural and direct” cause of the franchisor’s failure to receive future royalty payments. Indeed the franchisor could have remained entitled to those future royalties for the full term of the franchise contract even if it sued to collect the past payments. Nothing in the franchisee’s failure to pay past royalties in any sense prevented the franchisor from earning and receiving its future royalty payments. No, it was the franchisor’s own decision to terminate the franchise agreement that deprived it of its entitlement to those future royalty payments. At worst, if the franchisor had not terminated the franchise agreement it might have been required to sue again or perhaps again and again to compel the franchisee to pay those future royalties in a timely fashion as those royalties accrued. (However, given the strong lesson the Sealys would have learned in having to pay PIP’s attorney fees as well as interest and costs, it seems highly unlikely they would have ever again been late in making their royalty payments after losing this, the first collection action brought against them.)<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_21" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-21" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page174" class="pagebreak">174</div>
<p class="indent">PIP points to several California cases in which courts have awarded lost future profits in other contexts. But in none of these was the defendant’s breach a mere failure to pay moneys owed for past performance. Instead they involved total failures to perform at all.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, in <span class="italic">Hollywood Cleaning &amp; Pressing Co. v. Hollywood Laundry Service, Inc.</span> (1932), the defendant contracted to promote a cleaning service and subcontract exclusively with plaintiff for a ten-year period, then stopped performing at all after a short time. The breach was total and akin to those involved in the franchise cases discussed above where the franchisor wrongfully terminates the franchise or closes down a product line. So it is not surprising the California Supreme Court allowed the plaintiff to recover future profits it was prevented from earning as a direct result of defendant’s breach.</p>
<p class="indent">Another case PIP cites follows a similar scenario. In <span class="italic">Gold Min. &amp; Water Co. v. Swinerton</span> (1943), a lessor granted a lessee the right to extract minerals from a tract of land in return for a royalty based on the minerals extracted. Shortly thereafter, the lessor denied the lessee’s request to assign the lease. The lessee then repudiated the lease and refused to perform. The California Supreme Court allowed the plaintiff lessor to recover its lost future profits, in this case the royalty payments it would have earned on the extracted minerals had the lessee performed. But once again the defendant’s breach was a total failure to perform under the contract which directly prevented the plaintiff from earning those royalty payments. The lessee’s breach in <span class="italic">Gold Mining</span> was not his failure to make one or more of the periodic royalty payments he would have owed the lessor if he had performed his contractual duty to extract minerals. Instead his breach was his failure to perform his duty to extract the minerals in the first place. So once again this case is no authority for awarding future lost profits as a penalty for failing to timely pay past profits.</p>
<p class="indent">Not only is this a case of first impression, but it is difficult to locate close analogies.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_22" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-22" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> However, a franchise bears many similarities to a license and the relationship <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page175" class="pagebreak">175</span>between franchisor and franchisee is similar to that of licensor and licensee. So it is instructive to find a California court held a non-breaching party’s decision to terminate a license because of the other party’s breach also terminated the licensee’s duty to pay future royalties under the license. (<span class="italic">Fageol &amp; Tate v. Baird–Bailhache Co.</span> (1931)). In that case, the court held:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The provision for the termination of the contract upon default of the licensee was for the benefit of the licensors. Upon default of the licensee, the licensors could either terminate the contract by giving the thirty-day notice therein provided for or they could elect to continue the contract in force and insist on the payment of the royalties as they accrued. They could not do both * * *. The license of the appellant to manufacture and sell the patented articles ceased * * * and their obligation to pay future royalties ceased as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise in the instant case, once PIP terminated the Franchise Agreement the right of the Sealys to sell their printing services as a PIP franchise ceased, and so it would seem “their obligation to pay future royalties ceased as well.”</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude the Sealys’ breach in failing to timely pay past royalties and advertising fees was not a “proximate” or “natural and direct” cause of PIP’s loss of future royalties and advertising fees. Failing to make those payments did not prevent PIP from receiving royalties on future revenues the Sealys’ produced under the Franchise Agreement. It was only when PIP elected to terminate that agreement that it ended the Sealys’ ability to produce revenues as a PIP franchisee and also ended its own right to collect royalties on those revenues. Accordingly, these future profits are not a form of damages to which PIP is entitled for this particular breach of the franchise agreement. At the same time, we wish to make it clear we are not holding franchisors can never collect lost future royalties for franchisees’ breaches of the franchise agreement. That entitlement depends on the nature of the breach and whether the breach itself prevents the franchisor from earning those future royalties.</p>

<p class="indent">This prohibition is found in Civil Code section 3359. “Damages must, in all cases, be reasonable, and where an obligation of any kind appears to create a right to unconscionable and grossly oppressive damages, contrary to substantial justice, no more than reasonable damages can be recovered.” The limitation applies to contract as well as tort damages. The Restatement contains a similar limitation which applies specifically to contract damages. This one recognizes the potential of “future lost profit” awards in particular to produce excessive compensation for the plaintiff. “A court may limit damages for foreseeable loss by excluding recovery for loss of profits, * * * if it concludes that in the circumstances justice so requires in order to avoid disproportionate compensation.” (Restatement 2d Contracts § 351(3).)</p>
<p class="indent">In our view, PIP’s entitlement to recover its past unpaid royalties, along with attorneys fees and costs, along with its right to immediately install a new franchisee in what formerly had been the Sealys’ exclusive territory provides it with a full measure of “reasonable” damages. But a further award of “lost future royalties” provides PIP with “disproportionate compensation” which is “unreasonable” and an “unconscionable” and “grossly oppressive” imposition on its franchisee, the Sealys. To do so is “contrary to substantial justice” between franchisors and franchisees in general and this franchisor and this franchisee in particular. Damages of this nature and in this amount distort the relationship between the breach and its remedy and seriously disturb the balance between franchisor and franchisee and between creditor and debtor. In essence, allowing “lost future profits” damages in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page178" class="pagebreak">178</span>these circumstances would place a bludgeon in the hands of franchisors in contract disputes with their franchisees.</p>
<p class="indent">The relationship between franchisor and franchisee is a significant issue, and growing more important each year. As recently explained, “Franchising is rapidly becoming the dominant mode of distributing goods and services in the United States. According to the International Franchise Association, one out of every twelve businesses in the United States is a franchise. In addition, franchise systems now employ over eight million people and account for approximately forty-one percent of retail sales in the United States. Even conservative estimates predict that franchised businesses will be responsible for over fifty percent of retail sales by the year 2000.”</p>
<p class="indent">Although franchise agreements are commercial contracts they exhibit many of the attributes of consumer contracts. The relationship between franchisor and franchisee is characterized by a prevailing, although not universal, inequality of economic resources between the contracting parties. Franchisees typically, but not always, are small businessmen or businesswomen or people like the Sealys seeking to make the transition from being wage earners and for whom the franchise is their very first business. Franchisors typically, but not always, are large corporations. The agreements themselves tend to reflect this gross bargaining disparity. Usually they are form contracts the franchisor prepared and offered to franchisees on a take-or-leave-it basis. Among other typical terms, these agreements often allow the franchisor to terminate the agreement or refuse to renew for virtually any reason, including the desire to give a franchisor-owned outlet the prime territory the franchisee presently occupies.</p>
<p class="indent">Some courts and commentators have stressed the bargaining disparity between franchisors and franchisees is so great<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_24" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-24" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup> that franchise agreements exhibit many of the attributes of an adhesion contract and some of the terms of those contracts may be unconscionable. “Franchising involves the unequal bargaining power of franchisors and franchisees and therefore carries within itself the seeds of abuse. Before the relationship is established, abuse is threatened by the franchisor’s use of contracts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page179" class="pagebreak">179</span>of adhesion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Indeed such contracts are sometimes so one-sided, with all the obligations on the franchisee and none on the franchisor, as not to be legally enforceable.”</p>
<p class="indent">The “lost future profits” award PIP seeks in this case dramatically expands the already enormous bargaining gap between this franchisor and this franchisee. PIP argues it is entitled to these damages because the failure to timely make one or more royalty payments constitutes a “material breach” under the contract. The franchise agreement further provides any “material breach,” in turn, entitles the franchisor to terminate the contract and collect the “benefit of the bargain,” which in PIP’s view means all the future royalty fees the franchisor could expect to receive from this franchisee for the remaining term of the contract. Thus, under PIP’s view, had the Sealys failed to timely make their first royalty payment PIP would have been entitled to declare a breach, terminate the franchise agreement and collect 20 years of estimated future royalty payments from the newly disenfranchised franchisees, the Sealys.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_25" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-25" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">For reasons explained in section II, we do not construe the franchise agreement as permitting this form of damages as part of the franchisor’s “benefit of the bargain” when it elects to terminate the franchise because a franchisee failed to timely make some past royalty payments. As pointed out in this earlier section, in the context of a franchise arrangement “future lost profits” are not a result of the franchisee’s breach in failing to timely pay royalties but of the franchisor’s election to cancel the franchise agreement. Consequently, the receipt of “lost future royalty payments” is not part of the bargain to which the franchise agreement entitles the franchisor when it terminates for this type of breach.</p>
<p class="indent">But even assuming this contract is properly construed to call for an award of “lost future royalty payments” after PIP terminated the Sealys’ franchise for non-payment of past royalties, we conclude such an award would be “excessive” and “unconscionable” and “oppressive” within the meaning of Civil Code section 3359. Furthermore, it would provide PIP with “disproportionate compensation” within the meaning of Restatement 2nd Contracts section 351(3).</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" class="pagebreak">180</div>
<p class="indent">To sanction such an award in this case would so unbalance the relationship between franchisors and franchisees as to threaten to convert every franchise agreement allowing such damages into an unconscionable and oppressive contract. Imagine the position of a small-business person operating a franchise involved in some minor contract dispute with the franchisor during the 20–year term of the agreement. Don’t do exactly everything the way the franchisor demands and the franchisee risks declaration of a “material breach” backed up by the whip of a giant “lost future profits” award. Such an award would leave the franchisee enslaved for five or ten or twenty years working primarily for the franchisor’s benefit but without its trademark or other services. Franchisors would seldom have to apply that whip, of course. It would be enough to crack it now and then to keep their franchisees in line. This is nearly the definition of oppression. And, a specie of damage award which produces this degree of imbalance between a franchisor and his franchisees is clearly “oppressive” as well as “excessive.”</p>
<p class="indent">For this second independent and sufficient reason, we also are compelled to reverse the trial court’s award of “lost future profits” damages (in this case future royalty and advertising fee payments.)</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C<small>ONCLUSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Although we find compelling reasons for reversing the “lost future profits” award in this case, we emphasize the limits of our holding. We are not holding a trial court can never appropriately award some “lost future profits” to a franchisor. In a future case, the breach may be of a type which directly causes the franchisor to lose future profits independent of the franchisor’s own termination of the franchise agreement. Furthermore, the amount of the award may be of a size which is neither “excessive” nor “oppressive” nor “disproportionate to the loss.” What we do hold, however, is that a “lost future profits” award to a franchisor must satisfy all of these conditions—just as would such an award to any other party. Furthermore, we conclude the franchisor-franchisee relationship introduces some special considerations in determining whether the conditions are met. As detailed above, those considerations include the lengthy term of such agreements, the franchisor’s power to terminate the franchise and substitute a new franchisee, and the typical imbalance between the parties.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_26" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-26" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span></sup></p>

<p class="indent">Consider the following critique of <span class="italic">Sealy</span> in <span class="italic">Moran Indus. v. Mr. Transmission of Chattanooga</span>, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71753 (E.D. Tenn. 2010):</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The court’s decision in <span class="italic">Sealy</span> has come under scrutiny from courts and commentators alike in recent years. <span class="italic">See e.g.</span>, Robert L. Ebe, David L. Steinberg, &amp; Brett R. Waxdeck, <span class="italic">Radisson and the Potential Demise of the Sealy-Barnes-Hinton Rule</span>, 27 F<small>RANCHISE</small> L.J. 3, 5 (2007). Some courts … have adhered to the reasoning expressed in <span class="italic">Sealy</span>….</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">However, other courts have rejected the <span class="italic">Sealy</span> reasoning. For example, in <span class="italic">American Speedy Printing Centers, Inc. v. AM Marketing, Inc.</span> the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s award of $115,616.12 in lost future profits/royalties. In response to the franchisee’s argument that the franchisor was requesting inconsistent remedies, the Sixth Circuit disagreed:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">We agree with the district court and find that [the franchisor] requests consistent remedies… . It is clear from the plain language of both the franchise agreement and the complaint filed in this action that by the time [the franchisor] filed the complaint, it had already terminated the agreement in response to [the franchisee’s] breach. [The franchisor] seeks injunctive relief to stop [the franchisee] from using its marks or holding itself out as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page182" class="pagebreak">182</span>franchise owner, and monetary compensation in the form of lost profits/royalties for defendants’ actual breach of the agreement that has already occurred—entirely consistent remedies for separate and distinct injuries. The assignment of error is without merit.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Applying Michigan law, the Sixth Circuit determined that the franchisor’s future lost royalties were not too speculative and could be awarded because the franchisor “is entitled to all damages necessary to be put in a position equivalent to that in which it would find itself if the agreement continued in effect for the full twenty years.”</p>
<p class="blockquote">* * *</p>
<p class="blockquote">In their 2007 law review article on the subject, Radisson <span class="italic">and the Potential Demise of the</span> Sealy-Barnes-Hinton <span class="italic">Rule</span>, the authors summarize the “lack of consensus” in courts regarding a franchisor’s right to future lost royalties and then argue:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">that what we call the <span class="italic">Sealy/Barnes/Hinton</span> rule does not make sense. That rule, which basically allows future damages if the franchisee, but not the franchisor, terminates (even if the franchisee has committed continuing uncured breaches), elevates form over substance by failing to properly analyze proximate causation and, in many cases, properly apply principles of mitigation to avoid excessive damages. We suggest instead an approach more consistent with basic contract principles under which future lost profit damages should be available if, at the time of contracting, the parties might reasonably have foreseen that such losses would be the probable result of the franchisee’s breach. However, whether or not the agreement granted the franchisee an exclusive territory, a franchisor should not recover lost profits that the franchisee proves could have been either avoided by installing a replacement franchisee or otherwise mitigated.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The approach the authors believe follows basic principles of contract law more faithfully is outlined by the district court in <span class="italic">Radisson Hotels Int’l, Inc. v. Majestic Towers, Inc.</span>, a case involving breach of a hotel franchise agreement. In that case the franchise agreement contained a liquidated damages clause outlining damages that the franchisee would bear if the franchisor terminated the agreement due to the fault of the franchisee. The court analyzed the <span class="italic">Sealy</span> decision and distinguished the hotel franchise agreement from the agreement at issue in <span class="italic">Sealy</span>. In contrast to the agreement in <span class="italic">Sealy</span>, the hotel franchise agreement specifically contemplated liquidated damages based on the franchisor’s termination of the agreement due to the franchisee’s failure to pay royalties. In addition, however, the court noted in a footnote:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page183" class="pagebreak">183</div>
<p class="blockquote1">Alternatively, this Court believes that the <span class="italic">Sealy</span> decision is mistaken… . The <span class="italic">Sealy</span> court based its proximate cause analysis on a single case involving a licensor-licensee relationship decided by another intermediate California appellate court in 1931. In this Court’s view, the <span class="italic">Sealy</span> Court’s holding that a franchisor has no remedy but to sue the franchisee over and over again as lost royalties accrue is simply untenable… . the Court believes that where a franchisee breaches a contract and demonstrates that is it unable or unwilling to meet its obligations, lost future profits are a proximate result of the breach because the franchisee’s actions are a “substantial factor in bringing about that loss or damage.” Thus, this Court does not find <span class="italic">Sealy</span> to be persuasive.</p>

<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, 1976.</p>
<p class="sectionb">532 F.2d 957.</p>
<p class="indent">[This suit by an airline against an aircraft manufacturer was based on the late delivery of commercial airplanes due to diversion of resources into military production associated with the Vietnam War. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded the trial court’s judgment for the airline and discussed the question of damages as follows:]</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">V. T<small>HE</small> D<small>ETERMINATION OF</small> E<small>ASTERN</small>’<small>S</small> D<small>AMAGES</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">During the six-week damages phase of this bifurcated trial, the jury was confronted with a staggering array of highly technical evidence concerning the lost profits, surplus pilot expenses, wasted pilot training and rescheduling costs which Eastern alleges it suffered as a result of the delivery delays. The complexity of the airline business and its special sensitivity to economic and market fluctuations made the determination of Eastern’s lost profits especially difficult. This is best reflected, perhaps, by the extreme variation between the estimates provided by the parties’ experts. Eastern’s primary witness on the damages issue, Mr. Wemple, estimated that the delivery delays caused the airline to lose $23,400,000 in profits. McDonnell’s expert, Mr. Simat, on the other hand, estimated that Eastern saved at least $1,294,000 because the planes were not delivered on time.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_27" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-27" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span></sup> Throughout the damages trial, therefore, each side undertook extensive cross-examination of the other’s witnesses in an effort to account for this $24,600,000 discrepancy.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page184" class="pagebreak">184</div>
<p class="indent">At trial and on appeal, McDonnell has vigorously contested several of the basic assumptions underlying Eastern’s estimate of its damages. McDonnell relies on the established proposition that an expert’s opinion as to lost profits and other damages must be predicated on assumptions which have a reasonable basis in the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not enough, however, that several of Wemple’s assumptions may be open to question.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_28" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-28" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span></sup> Instead, the issue is whether the probative value of the expert’s testimony was so slight that it should not have been submitted to the jury.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_29" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span></sup> A jury’s award of damages, therefore, may have adequate support in the evidence even though an expert’s assumptions and methodology may not have been the only permissible ones for determining damages.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than anticipate the relitigation of this issue, we pretermit any assessment of the Wemple testimony. We do, however, make several suggestions which the District Court may consider in the event that a retrial of Eastern’s damages claims becomes necessary. In our view, the trial judge is obliged to scrutinize most carefully unusually technical or complicated expert testimony. A court must be mindful of the particular difficulties that can arise when a plaintiff resorts, in Judge Friendly’s words, “to an array of figures conveying a delusive impression of exactness in an area where a jury’s common sense is less available than usual to protect it.” <span class="italic">Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.</span>, 2 Cir., 1962.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page185" class="pagebreak">185</div>
<p class="indent">The District Court must do more than merely weigh the probative value of an expert’s testimony considered as a whole. Where practical, a trial judge should exclude particular assumptions or other aspects of an expert’s testimony which considered individually do not meet the “minimum of probative value.” This more detailed scrutiny is necessary because some telling errors may become virtually unreviewable once the jury has returned its verdict.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, for example, Wemple should have considered whether Eastern’s estimated loss of profits was reduced by the cost of financing those planes which were purchased rather than leased. McDonnell argues that this was an error which overstated the airline’s lost profits by $1.6 million. However, because Eastern was awarded only 85 per cent of the damages estimated by Wemple, it cannot be said that McDonnell’s cross-examination did not bring this point home to the jury. In complicated or technical cases, therefore, an expert’s testimony should be cleansed of unsupportable assumptions or clear errors which have less than the minimum of probative value. This would reduce the possibility of a confused jury and an arbitrary verdict.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, we note that the District Court has the discretion to call an expert witness on its own. The unusual difficulty of estimating a major airline’s lost profits resulting from extensive delays stretching over a period of three years and involving 90 jet aircraft suggests to us that the jury might benefit from the testimony of a neutral expert in this case. Because a court-appointed witness would be unconcerned with either promoting or attacking a particular estimate of Eastern’s damages, he could provide an objective insight into the $24.5 million difference of opinion between the parties’ experts. Indeed, the mere presence of a neutral expert may have, in Judge Prettyman’s phrase, “a great tranquilizing effect” on the experts retained by Eastern and McDonnell.</p>
<p id="sec95" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Given the $24 million range in Eastern’s damages based on the conflicting expert testimony, why aren’t the damages considered too speculative? Does testimony by “experts” who disagree wildly render the damage calculation more or less speculative than it would otherwise be? Compare <span class="italic">Eastern Air Lines</span> with <span class="italic">Freund</span> and <span class="italic">Sealy</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Knowing the great difficulty in measuring damages resulting from late delivery (and the even greater difficulty of obtaining specific performance), what might you advise Eastern to have done?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Are there special problems associated with the Fifth Circuit’s suggestion to the District Court regarding the appointment of a neutral expert?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page186" class="pagebreak">186</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Since <span class="italic">Eastern Air Lines</span> was decided, the Supreme Court has tightened the rules on the admission of expert testimony in federal trials to ensure that the methodology or technique employed by the expert is generally accepted in the relevant discipline. <span class="italic">See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals</span>, 509 U.S. 579 (1993). Nevertheless, concerns about the probative value and integrity of partisan expert testimony proffered on damages issues in complex cases have only increased. <span class="italic">See</span> Hill, Hogan, Karam &amp; Langvardt, <span class="italic">Increasing Complexity and Partisanship in Business Damages Expert Testimony: The Need for a Modified Trial Regime in Quantification of Damages,</span> 11 U.

Pleasant Stable Co. v. Steinberg</span>, 238 Mass. 567, the plaintiff company agreed to supply teams of horses at agreed rates as required from day to day by the defendant for his business. To prepare itself to fulfil the contract and in reliance on it, the plaintiff bought two “Cliest” horses at a certain price. When the defendant repudiated the contract, the plaintiff sold the horses at a loss and in its action for breach claimed the loss as an element of damages. The court properly held that the plaintiff was not entitled to this item as it was also claiming (and recovering) its lost profits (expectancy) on the contract as a whole. <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Noble v. Ames Mfg. Co., 112 Mass. 492. (The loss on sale of the horses is analogous to the pain and suffering for which the patient would be disallowed a recovery in <span class="italic">Hawkins v.

Pleasant</span> case referred, however, to <span class="italic">Pond v. Harris</span>, 113 Mass. 114, as a contrasting situation where the expectancy could not be fairly determined. There the defendant had wrongfully revoked an agreement to arbitrate a dispute with the plaintiff (this was before such agreements were made specifically enforceable). In an action for the breach, the plaintiff was held entitled to recover for his preparations for the arbitration which had been rendered useless and a waste, including the plaintiff’s time and trouble and his expenditures for counsel and witness. The context apparently was commercial but reliance elements were held compensable when there was no fair way of estimating an expectancy. A noncommercial example is <span class="italic">Smith v.

Thus, <span class="italic">Gonzales v. Internat. Assn. of Machinists</span> holds that the trial court correctly instructed the jury that plaintiff union member, a machinist, was required to make “such <span class="italic">efforts</span> as the average [member of his union] desiring employment would make at that particular time and place” (italics added); but, further, that the court <span class="italic">properly rejected defendant’s offer of proof of the availability of other kinds of employment</span> at the same or higher pay than plaintiff usually received and all outside the jurisdiction of his union, as plaintiff could not be required to accept different employment or a nonunion job.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">In <span class="italic">Harris v. Nat. Union, etc</span>., <span class="italic">Cooks</span> and <span class="italic">Stewards</span>, the issues were stated to be, inter alia, whether comparable employment was open to each plaintiff employee, and if so whether each plaintiff made a <span class="italic">reasonable effort</span> to secure such employment. It was held that the trial court properly <span class="italic">sustained an objection to an offer to prove a custom of accepting a job in a lower rank</span> when work in the higher rank was not available, as “The duty of mitigation of damages * * * does not require the plaintiff ‘to seek or to accept other employment of a different or inferior kind.’” (254 P.2d at 676.) …</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-16" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_16" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a>.  The issue is generally discussed in terms of a duty on the part of the employee to minimize loss. The practice is long established and there is little reason to change despite Judge Cardozo’s observation of its subtle inaccuracy. “The servant is free to accept employment or reject it according to his uncensored pleasure. What is meant by the supposed duty is merely this: That if he unreasonably reject, he will not be heard to say that the loss of wages from then on shall be deemed the jural consequence of the earlier discharge. He has broken the chain of causation, and loss resulting to him thereafter is suffered through his own act.” (<span class="italic">McClelland v. Climax Hosiery Mills</span> (1930) 252 N.Y. 347, 359, concurring opinion.)</p>

Many of the older cases hold that one need not accept work in an inferior rank or position nor work which is more menial or arduous. This suggests that the rule may have had its origin in the bourgeois fear of resubmergence in lower economic classes.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-18" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_18" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  The values of the doctrine of mitigation of damages in this context are that it minimizes the unnecessary personal and social (e.g., nonproductive use of labor, litigation) costs of contractual failure. If a wrongfully discharged employee can, through his own action and without suffering financial or psychological loss in the process, reduce the damages accruing from the breach of contract, the most sensible policy is to require him to do so. I fear the majority opinion will encourage precisely opposite conduct.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-19" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_19" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a>.  Plaintiff’s declaration states simply that she has not received any payment from defendant under the “Bloomer Girl” contract and that the only persons authorized to collect money for her are her attorney and her agent.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">The declaration of Herman Citron, plaintiff’s theatrical agent, alleges that prior to the formation of the “Bloomer Girl” contract he discussed with Richard Zanuck, defendant’s vice president, the conditions under which plaintiff might be interested in doing “Big Country”; that it was Zanuck who informed him of Fox’s decision to cancel production of “Bloomer Girl” and queried him as to plaintiff’s continued interest in “Big Country”; that he informed Zanuck that plaintiff was shocked by the decision, had turned down other offers because of her commitment to defendant for “Bloomer Girl” and was not interested in “Big Country.” It further alleges that “Bloomer Girl” was to have been a musical review which would have given plaintiff an opportunity to exhibit her talent as a dancer as well as an actress and that “Big Country” was a straight dramatic role; the former to have been produced in California, the latter in Australia. Citron’s declaration concludes by stating that he has not received any payment from defendant for plaintiff under the “Bloomer Girl” contract.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">Benjamin Neuman’s declaration states that he is plaintiff’s attorney; that after receiving notice of defendant’s breach he requested Citron to make every effort to obtain other suitable employment for plaintiff; that he (Neuman) rejected defendant’s offer to settle for $400,000 and that he has not received any payment from defendant for plaintiff under the “Bloomer Girl” contract. It also sets forth correspondence between Neuman and Fox which culminated in Fox’s final rejection of plaintiff’s demand for full payment.</p>

In his argument, counsel appeared to imply once it filed this action to recover these particular unpaid past royalty payments “basic contract principles” would prohibit PIP from filing suit to recover later unpaid royalty payments owed under the same contract.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">Our research suggests the contrary proposition is well settled in contract law.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">The franchise agreement in this case establishes an executory contract. The franchisee receives a benefit each month—use of the franchisor’s trademark and services—and pays for that benefit each month. When the franchisee fails to pay for one month’s benefit the franchisor can sue to recover the unpaid payment for that month without losing its right to provide future benefits and sue again should the franchisee once again fail to pay for those later benefits. Even “[w]here one party to an executory contract repudiates it and refuses any longer to be bound by it, the injured party has the right to elect to * * * keep the contract alive for the benefit of both parties, being and keeping himself at all times ready, willing, and able to perform his part of the contract, and at the time fixed by the contract for performance, sue and recover according to the terms of the contract * * *.” (Armstrong v. Illinois Bankers Life Ass’n. (1940); Williston on Contracts, supra, 695.)</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-22" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_22" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>.  Although the cases are distinguishable on the facts, we observe two other courts expressed reluctance to award future royalties to franchisors once their franchisees lost the trademark and other benefits to which they had been entitled under the franchise agreement. In <span class="italic">In re Arthur Treacher’s Franchisee Litigation</span> (3d Cir.1982), a franchisor terminated a franchise and then sued to enjoin a franchisee from continued use of the trademark. By the time the case reached the appellate state the franchisee had agreed to give up the trademark and other franchise benefits. The Third Circuit then held, “Since [defendant] is no longer an Arthur Treacher’s franchisee using Arthur Treacher’s trademark, it should no longer be required to pay royalties.”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-23" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_23" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  Because we reverse the “future lost profits” award on the two grounds discussed in this opinion, we need not consider whether this award also runs afoul of a third limitation on such awards. The law allows the award of lost future profits only when courts can calculate their amount with some degree of certainty.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">In the present case, the trial court found that degree of certainty in a straightforward projection of past experience to the seven and a half years remaining on the franchise contract. The court based this projection on the Sealy’s gross income for the 1990–1991 period. It multiplied this gross by the royalty fee of 6 percent and the advertising fee of 1 percent to arrive at an annual lost royalty figure. The court then multiplied that annual lost royalty amount by the number of years remaining on the franchise contract.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">At first blush, the very simplicity of this calculation appears to support a finding it is possible to estimate “lost future profits” in this case with the requisite certainty. But upon closer examination this simple formula may be an oversimplification. In order to estimate what PIP stands to lose in the form of lost future profits after it terminated the Sealys’ franchise requires a court to consider a complex equation of imponderables. It takes a great deal of courage if not daring to venture a guess as to the gross profits a PIP outlet is likely to earn seven—or five or even three—years hence in a field as volatile as printing and reproduction. By the time this franchise term runs out “desktop publishing,” the “information superhighway,” the “paperless office,” and like developments already may have transformed the industry in which the PIP stores and like operations strive to operate. This case arises in a field where the short term future to say nothing of the medium and long term future is almost uniquely unpredictable.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">But the major imponderable in estimating how much net profit PIP will lose over the next seven years resulted from PIP’s election to terminate the franchise agreement and thus to release PIP to open a new outlet directly across the street from the Sealys’ print store. Or it could open a “mega store” a few blocks away with advanced equipment and services which drew customers from a broad territory including the Sealy print store. In either event, the Sealys could lose most or all of their business—and gross revenues—to another PIP franchise or two. Meanwhile PIP would be receiving royalty payments from its new franchisees on the business which used to go to the Sealys but now went to the competing PIP outlets. To the extent it received these royalty payments PIP would not experience net “lost profits” from the Sealys’ departure from the PIP fold. Conversely, to the extent PIP already had received a “lost profits” damage award from the Sealys, the corporation would receive double profits on the income its new franchisee managed to attract from the Sealys.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">Whether and when PIP chooses to award a franchise to open a store or mega store which will compete with the Sealys’ establishment is almost entirely in PIP’s control. The franchisor is free to do so from the moment it cancels the agreement. It has little incentive to install a new franchise, however, until it has won its award of “future lost profits” from the disenfranchised franchisee, assuming the courts allow such an award. Once the franchisor has that award in its pocket, it has nothing to lose from vigorously seeking out someone interested in opening a franchise store right next door to its former franchisee. Any dollar that new franchisee turns over to the franchisor in the form of a royalty payment is a dollar of extra profit for that franchisor, since it already has received its expected royalty payments for that franchise territory in the form of a “lost future profits” award from the court.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">It follows that a franchisor, such as PIP, would have every reason to wait until after it received the “lost future profits” award before doing anything which someone might construe as an attempt to install a competitor to its former franchisee. For, if it does so before trial the franchisor would risk losing its “future lost profits” damages. So it is hardly surprising the Sealys failed to introduce evidence PIP had awarded a competing franchise or was about to or even had done anything suggesting it might be considering that option. Moreover, short of finding and tendering its own competition, the Sealys had no way of mitigating the “lost future profits” damages they might be inflicting on PIP.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">This court recognizes these difficulties in arriving at an estimate of net “lost future royalties” in which we can have any confidence. However, we need not and do not address the issue whether the extreme instability of the print shop market and especially the franchisor’s absolute control over the “competing franchisee” variable combine to render any estimate of net future lost royalties so speculative as to preclude an award of such damages.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-24" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_24" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>.  A comment PIP’s counsel made at oral argument underscores this franchisee’s lack of bargaining power. The court asked why any prospective franchisee would sign an agreement with PIP if the contract were construed to give PIP up to twenty years of “lost future profits” for a failure to timely make a royalty payment or for a similar “material breach.” PIP’s counsel responded there were lots of people earning $6 an hour in the labor force who would welcome the opportunity to sign such an agreement in order to gain the chance for the much higher earnings available to successful PIP franchisees. (This evidently was a reference to the Sealys, since there are indications in the record Mr. Sealy was working for $6 an hour prior to becoming a PIP franchisee.)</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-25" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_25" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>.  The terms of this Franchise Agreement, if fully enforced, would have been even more draconian. As noted earlier, the Agreement contained a “no compete” clause which precluded the Sealys from continuing in the printshop business. Were that term enforced along with the “lost future royalties” award, the Sealys would have been required to pay a judgment calculated as a percentage of the gross receipts they no longer were allowed to earn, even if they did so without the PIP trademark or other franchise benefits. Meanwhile PIP would have been able to install a new franchisee, perhaps in the Sealys’ abandoned location, and receive a second royalty on the same business which formerly would have gone to the Sealys but now was coming to its new franchisee.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-26" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_26" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a>.  We also stress we do not adopt a position the Sealys’ counsel advocated at oral argument. He pressed for a rule which would allow franchisees to terminate the franchise agreement almost at will subject only to forfeiture of the “security deposit” and payment of past unpaid royalties, if any.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">The Sealys’ counsel justified this as a market oriented solution. He argued franchisees would only give up their rights to the franchise trademark and other services when those “benefits” no longer were worth the franchise fee because it had become a “dying” franchise system. (He further claimed PIP is such a “dying” system, because of changes in technology and market conditions.) In his view, it is unfair and uneconomic to force franchisees to remain linked to a sinking franchisor by requiring them to continue paying royalty fees if they elect to terminate the franchise agreement. It is better for the economy to permit strong franchisees to swim away on their own to operate as independent businesses rather than sinking with the rest of the system. If required to continue paying royalties for unnecessary and possibly counterproductive trademarks and services, even the stronger franchisees may not be able to survive.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">This is an interesting argument but one which we do not adopt in this opinion. For whatever reason, the Sealys’ counsel argued for a principle far broader than needed to resolve the instant case. Here we have a franchise agreement the franchisor, not the franchisee elected to terminate, instead of maintaining the franchise and filing a debt collection action for unpaid royalties. The franchisor cited the franchisee’s failure to timely make some past royalty payments as the “material breach” justifying this termination. Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary for this court to consider what “future lost profits” damages might be appropriate where a franchisee rather than the franchisor unilaterally terminates the agreement.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-27" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_27" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a>.  Mr. Simat estimated that, as a result of late deliveries, Eastern suffered a loss in operating profit of at most $0.3 million. This loss, in Mr. Simat’s view, was more than offset by the added costs of capital Eastern would have incurred in order to obtain and pay for the Douglas aircraft. These added costs, which were not considered by Mr. Wemple, were estimated as being over $1.6 million.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-28" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/13_chapter02.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_28" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a>.  McDonnell’s primary contention is that there is no basis in the evidence for Mr. Wemple’s assumption that the 3 per cent increase in capacity which would have resulted from timely deliveries would have been matched by an equivalent increase in passenger traffic. However, McDonnell also argues that Wemple’s use of “system wide average passenger yields” overstated the gross revenues which Eastern would have received because the airline’s yields on Douglas jets were substantially lower than the system average. McDonnell contends further that Wemple assigned additional passenger traffic and revenue to Eastern’s shuttle services when, in fact, all passengers desiring to use this service were being accommodated. Another Wemple assumption challenged by McDonnell is that 20 per cent of Eastern’s costs ($164.5 million) would not have increased at all even if the Douglas planes had been delivered on time. McDonnell also claims that it was speculative for Wemple to assume that Eastern would have derived extra cargo income on a percentage basis equivalent to the assumed increase in passengers. Finally McDonnell attacks Wemple’s failure to deduct from Eastern’s estimated lost profits the cost of financing those aircraft which were purchased rather than leased.</p>
