<p class="indent">The parties’ promises create legal rights and obligations that the state enforces through the courts. In this sense, contract-making is a kind of lawmaking. How does the law the parties make for themselves by their agreements fit in with the larger system of law binding on everyone?</p>
<p class="indent">The legal system often supports private contracts and sometimes defers to them. UCC § 1-302 for instance, states a general principle that “the effect of provisions of this Act may be varied by agreement,” provided however that “[t]he obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by this Act may not be disclaimed by agreement.” Subject to these exceptions, therefore, the UCC provides a background law, sometimes referred to as “default rules,” that applies only if the parties do not agree on other rules for themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">But many laws or regulations are mandatory rather than merely “default rules.” A contract does not exclude the regulatory power of the state to order behavior. Some contracts are illegal, and others are unenforceable because they contravene clear public policies embodied in specific laws. Contract law will not enforce an agreement to sell illegal narcotics, nor one to fix prices. In these examples, making or performing the contract is a crime and the parties to the agreement may be fined or imprisoned. In other cases, the state does not go that far. It declares that a promise is unenforceable but not punishable. For example, in some states unlicensed building contractors cannot recover against homeowners who refuse to pay as provided in the agreement. Sometimes the label of “illegality” is undoubtedly intended to channel behavior and to discourage undesirable transactions. Sometimes this is less clear, and it appears that the court’s primary concern is its unwillingness to become involved in a messy or distasteful situation. In every case, the label indicates a judgment that the autonomy of the parties to fix their own rules should be limited based on social or public rulemaking.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page300" class="pagebreak">300</div>
<p class="indent">As the regulatory state has expanded into a modern-day Leviathan, the sheer quantity of positive legislation impinging on contractual relations has exploded. Thus, employment contracts are constrained by a host of labor and tax laws that impose many obligations on employers that they would never have agreed to accept and deny or limit enforcement to otherwise bargained-for terms. Everyday contractual relations with financial institutions are framed with reference to an equally imposing assortment of banking, tax, and securities regulation. Environmental, homeland security, consumer protection, antitrust, safety regulations, to name but a few areas of modern regulatory legislation, expressly constrain the enforcement and content of contracts all the time in many or most contexts and circumstances. Comprehensively delineating the scope and content of such legislation in a first-year Contracts course is impossible. Such legislation and regulation will form the heart of many of the advanced statutory courses in the upper-level law school curriculum. But to paraphrase John Donne, contract law is not an island entire of itself, it is a part of the main body of the law, and, inevitably, in the course of counseling clients and practicing law, one must understand the applicable constraints that legislation imposes upon contracting parties.</p>
<p class="indent">For centuries the common law has also refused to enforce those bargained-for promises thought to contravene public policy. Courts will not aid an assassin in collecting his blood money. Even if the refusal does not meaningfully deter homicide, it is inappropriate to make the judicial process available in support of such an agreement. Defining public policy for these purposes historically was mostly a matter of judicial development. Judges decided, for example, that it was contrary to public policy to restrain trade or impair family relations; courts wouldn’t help even if someone had paid good money for a promise to do something contrary to these policies. Today public policy is most often manifested in legislation. Statutes regulate credit and consumer transactions and the licensing of trades and professions. When a statute does not directly control the issue, judges will often point to the existence or absence of related legislation as support for a judicial declaration of public policy.</p>
<p class="indent">The following cases offer illustrations of this form of judicial activity. What makes judges hostile to these transactions? Are community interests furthered by the refusal to enforce the promises made?</p>

<p id="sec139" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">McConnell v. Commonwealth Pictures Corp.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1960.</p>
<p class="sectionb">7 N.Y.2d 465, 166 N.E.2d 494, 199 N.Y.S.2d 483.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ D<small>ESMOND</small>, C.J. … Plaintiff sues for an accounting. Defendant had agreed in writing that, if plaintiff should succeed in negotiating a contract with a motion picture producer whereby defendant would get the distribution rights for certain motion pictures, defendant would pay plaintiff $10,000 on execution of the contract between defendant and the producer, and would thereafter pay plaintiff a stated percentage of defendant’s gross receipts from distribution of the pictures. Plaintiff negotiated the distribution rights for defendant and defendant paid plaintiff the promised $10,000 but later refused to pay him the commissions or to give him an accounting of profits.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s answer contains, besides certain denials and counterclaims not now before us, two affirmative defenses the sufficiency of which we must decide. In these defenses it is asserted that plaintiff, without the knowledge of defendant or of the producer, procured the distribution rights by bribing a representative of the producer and that plaintiff agreed to pay and did pay to that representative as a bribe the $10,000 which defendant paid plaintiff. The courts below (despite a strong dissent in the Appellate Division) held that the defenses were insufficient to defeat plaintiff’s suit. Special Term’s opinion said that, since the agreement sued upon between plaintiff and defendant was not in itself illegal, plaintiff’s right to be paid for performing it could not be defeated by a showing that he had misconducted himself in carrying it out. The court found a substantial difference between this and the performance of an illegal contract. We take a different view. Proper and consistent application of a prime and long-settled public policy closes the doors of our courts to those who sue to collect the rewards of corruption.</p>
<p class="indent">New York’s policy has been frequently and emphatically announced in the decisions. “It is the settled law of this State (and probably of every other State) that a party to an illegal contract cannot ask a court of law to help him carry out his illegal object, nor can such a person plead or prove in any court a case in which he, as a basis for his claim, must show forth his illegal purpose,” <span class="italic">Stone v. Freeman,</span> 298 N.Y. 268, 271, citing the leading cases. The money plaintiff sues for was the fruit of an admitted crime and “no court should be required to serve as paymaster of the wages of crime.” Id. And it makes no difference that defendant has no title to the money since the court’s concern “is not with the position of the defendant” but with the question of whether “a recovery by the plaintiff should be denied for the sake of public interests,” a question which is one “of public policy in the administration of the law.” <span class="italic">Flegenheimer v. Brogan,</span> 284 N.Y. 268, 272. That public policy is the one described in <span class="italic">Riggs v. Palmer</span>:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page302" class="pagebreak">302</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">No one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, or to take advantage of his own wrong, or to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime. These maxims are dictated by public policy, have their foundation in universal law administered in all civilized countries, and have nowhere been superseded by statutes.</p>
<p class="indent">We must either repudiate those statements of public policy or uphold these challenged defenses. It is true that some of the leading decisions were in suits on intrinsically illegal contracts but the rule fails of its purpose unless it covers a case like the one at bar. Here, as in <span class="italic">Stone v. Freeman</span>, the money sued for was (assuming the truth of the defenses) “the fruit of an admitted crime.” To allow this plaintiff to collect his commissions would be to let him “profit by his own fraud, or to take advantage of his own wrong, or to found a claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime” (<span class="italic">Riggs v. Palmer)</span>. The issue is not whether the acts alleged in the defenses would constitute the crime of commercial bribery under section 439 of the Penal Law, although it appears that they would. “A seller cannot recover the price of goods sold where he has paid a commission to an agent of the purchaser; neither could the agent recover the commission, even at common law and before the enactment of section [439] of the Penal Law” (Judge Crane in <span class="italic">Reiner v. North American Newspaper Alliance,</span> 259 N.Y. 250, 261)….</p>
<p class="indent">We are not working here with narrow questions of technical law. We are applying fundamental concepts of morality and fair dealing not to be weakened by exceptions. So far as precedent is necessary, we can rely on <span class="italic">Sirkin v. Fourteenth Street Store</span>, and <span class="italic">Reiner v. North American Newspaper Alliance</span>. <span class="italic">Sirkin</span> is the case closest to ours and shows that, whatever be the law in other jurisdictions, we in New York deny awards for the corrupt performance of contracts even though in essence the contracts are not illegal. Sirkin had sued for the price of goods sold and delivered to defendant. Held to be good was a defense which charged that plaintiff seller had paid a secret commission to an agent of defendant purchaser. There cannot be any difference in principle between that situation and the present one where plaintiff (it is alleged) contracted to buy motion-picture rights for defendant but performed his covenant only by bribing the seller’s agent. In the <span class="italic">Reiner</span> case, likewise, the plaintiff had fully performed the services required by his agreement with the defendant but was denied a recovery because his performance had involved and included “fraud and deception” practiced not on defendant but on a third party. It is beside the point that the present plaintiff on the trial might be able to prove a prima facie case without the bribery being exposed. On the whole case (again assuming that the defenses speak the truth) the disclosed situation would be within the rule of our precedents forbidding court assistance to bribers.</p>
<p class="indent">It is argued that a reversal here means that the doing of any small illegality in the performance of an otherwise lawful contract will deprive the doer of all rights, with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page303" class="pagebreak">303</span>the result that the other party will get a windfall and there will be great injustice. Our ruling does not go as far as that. It is not every minor wrongdoing in the course of contract performance that will insulate the other party from liability for work done or goods furnished. There must at least be a direct connection between the illegal transaction and the obligation sued upon. Connection is a matter of degree. Some illegalities are merely incidental to the contract sued on. We cannot now, any more than in our past decisions, announce what will be the results of all the kinds of corruption, minor and major, essential and peripheral. All we are doing here is labeling the conduct described in these defenses as gross corruption depriving plaintiff of all right of access to the courts of New York State. Consistent with public morality and settled public policy, we hold that a party will be denied recovery even on a contract valid on its face, if it appears that he has resorted to gravely immoral and illegal conduct in accomplishing its performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps this application of the principle represents a distinct step beyond <span class="italic">Sirkin</span> and <span class="italic">Reiner</span> in the sense that we are here barring recovery under a contract which in itself is entirely legal. But if this be an extension, public policy supports it. We point out that our holding is limited to cases in which the illegal performance of a contract originally valid takes the form of commercial bribery or similar conduct and in which the illegality is central to or a dominant part of the plaintiff’s whole course of conduct in performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no pertinence here of the rule which makes such defenses unavailable to one who is a mere depository or escrow-that is, one who is holding money or goods for one of the parties without himself being a party to the transaction sued upon. That exception is used when, in execution or satisfaction of an illegal transaction, one of the parties thereto turns over money or property to a third person (not a party to the illegal deal) for the use of one who is a party. In our case there were two parties only plaintiff and defendant. There is no third person holding money or property.</p>
<p class="indent">The sufficiency of defendant’s counterclaim (for the return of its $10,000) was litigated below but it is not before us on this appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, the certified question answered in the negative, and plaintiff’s motion, insofar as it attacks the sufficiency of the two separate defenses, should be denied.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ F<small>ROESSEL</small>, J. (dissenting). Plaintiff sues for an accounting and related relief under a clearly lawful contract, whereby defendant agreed to make certain payments in connection with plaintiff’s negotiation, on behalf of defendant, of an agreement with Universal Pictures Company, Inc., for distribution rights with respect to 40 western feature films and 4 serial motion pictures. The payments agreed upon were $10,000 upon the execution of a contract with Universal, and 20% of all the gross receipts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page304" class="pagebreak">304</span>received by defendant from the distribution of said pictures after defendant had recouped the amount of $100,000 from 60% of the gross receipts. Upon negotiation of the distribution rights, defendant paid plaintiff said sum of $10,000, but thereafter declined upon demand to pay plaintiff any further moneys.</p>
<p class="indent">Two defenses set forth in the answer were stricken below. The first defense alleged that plaintiff secured the Universal contract as a result of influencing an agent of Universal and United World Films, Inc., to cause United to execute the contract with defendant, for which he paid the agent $10,000, in claimed violation of section 439 of the Penal Law. The second defense reiterated the allegations of the first, and alleged that the enforcement of the contract would be contrary to public policy. These allegations are denied, except of course as they are deemed admitted as a matter of law by challenging their legal sufficiency. It is to be noted that defendant does not charge that its own agent was bribed or that its contract with plaintiff contemplates any illegal act. Moreover, neither the answer nor the affidavit in opposition suggests that Universal or United has in anywise questioned the distribution contract or that defendant has not enjoyed the full fruits thereof.</p>
<p class="indent">The narrow question before us as framed by Special Term is “whether the unlawful acts imputed to the plaintiff in performance are fatal to recovery under a lawful contract.” We agree with the courts below “that recovery for services under a valid agreement may be had, notwithstanding that the plaintiff has in the course of their rendition committed illegal acts.” This was implicit in our holding in <span class="italic">Chesebrough v. Conover</span>, and it was so squarely held in <span class="italic">Dunham v. Hastings Pavement Co.</span>, where the court correctly stated the applicable rule of law as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">If the contract contemplated legal service, and that alone, we do not think that it would be rendered illegal by the fact that the plaintiff did illegal acts in its performance. The question is and continues, was the contract in fact for the performance of illegal service? If it was not, then it is valid and can be enforced.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not a case where the contract <span class="italic">sued upon</span> is intrinsically illegal; or was <span class="italic">procured</span> by the commission of a crime; or where a beneficiary under a will murdered his ancestor in order to obtain the speedy enjoyment of his property. In the <span class="italic">Sirkin</span> case, so heavily relied upon by the majority, the plaintiff obtained the very contract he was seeking to enforce by paying secret commissions to defendant’s own purchasing agent. In <span class="italic">Merchants’ Line v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.</span>, we pointed out that in <span class="italic">Sirkin</span> “the plaintiff reached and bribed the man who made <span class="italic">the contract under which he was seeking to recover</span>” (emphasis supplied). In <span class="italic">Morgan Munitions Supply Co. v. Studebaker Corp.</span>, we likewise cited the <span class="italic">Sirkin</span> case for the proposition that “a contract <span class="italic">procured by</span> the commission of a crime is unenforceable even if executed” (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the contract which plaintiff is seeking to enforce is perfectly valid, and it was not intended or even contemplated that plaintiff would perform the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page305" class="pagebreak">305</span>contract by illegal or corrupt means. Having received and retained the full benefits of plaintiff’s performance, defendant now seeks to “inject into” its contract with plaintiff, “which was fair and legal in itself, the illegal feature of the other independent transaction.” <span class="italic">Messersmith v. American Fidelity Co.</span> This court is now adopting a rule that a party may retain the benefits of, but escape his obligations under, a wholly lawful contract if the other party commits some illegal act not contemplated nor necessary under the contract. By way of a single illustration, an owner may thus avoid paying his contractor for the cost of erecting a building because the contractor gave an inspector a sum of money to expedite an inspection.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority opinion seeks to distinguish between “major” and “minor” illegality and “direct” and “peripheral” corruption. It decides this case on the ground that the manner in which plaintiff performed his admittedly valid contract with defendant was “gravely immoral and illegal.” Such distinctions are neither workable nor sanctioned by authority. If a contract was lawfully made, and did not contemplate wrongdoing, it is enforcible; if, on the other hand, it was procured by the commission of a crime, or was in fact for the performance of illegal services, it is not enforcible. These are the criteria distinguishing enforcible from unenforcible contracts not “nice” distinctions between degrees of illegality and immorality in the performance of lawful contracts, or whether the illegal act of performance was “directly” or “peripherally” related to the main contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, a reversal here would be contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of our holding in <span class="italic">Southwestern Shipping Corp. v. National City Bank</span>. The broad proposition for which that case stands is that a party unconnected with an illegal agreement should not be permitted to reap a windfall by pleading the illegality of that agreement, to which he was a stranger. There, the contract between the plaintiff and the bank was entirely lawful, and the bank attempted to avoid the consequences of its breach of contract and negligence by asserting the illegality of a different contract between plaintiff and a third party. Here, the contract between plaintiff and defendant was perfectly legal, and defendant is seeking to avoid its obligations under the contract of which it has reaped the benefits for some 12 years by asserting the illegality of a different and subsequent agreement between plaintiff and a third party. This it should not be permitted to do.</p>
<p class="indent">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs, and the question certified answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ V<small>AN</small> V<small>OORHIS</small>, J. (dissenting). Public morals and fair dealing are likely to be advanced by limiting rather than by enlarging the rule that is being extended to the facts of this case. This rule is grounded on considerations of public policy. Courts will not intervene between thieves to compel them to divide the spoils. But in a situation like the present, it seems to me that the effect of this decision will not be to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page306" class="pagebreak">306</span>restrain the corrupt influencing of agents, employees or servants but to encourage misappropriation of funds and breaches of faith between persons who do not stand in corrupt relationships with one another. The public interest is not served best by decisions which put a premium on taking unconscionable advantage of such situations, or which drive the enforcement of obligations of this kind underground. I concur in the dissenting opinion by Judge Froessel.</p>
<p id="sec140" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Chief Judge Desmond and Judge Froessel are bound by the same precedents and the same factual record on appeal. Review each opinion and compare their treatment of the following issues: What questions does each judge think that the court must answer? What does each judge think that the earlier cases mean—that is, what do the prior cases tell him is the law? Do the judges agree which public policy is at issue? What is the source of that public policy? What does each judge think the court must do to further that public policy? Where does Chief Judge Desmond find the “fundamental concepts of morality and fair dealing not to be weakened by exceptions” that he refers to on p. 302?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Suppose that Seller, in order to deliver goods to Buyer on time, speeds to the place of delivery in violation of the speed limit. Is Buyer excused from accepting the goods and paying for them? If Buyer only learns of the speeding violation after accepting the goods but before paying for them, can Buyer keep the goods but refuse to pay for them? If McConnell had asked, would the court have forced Commonwealth to give up its distribution rights and all the profits made as of the time of litigation?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Can Universal/United refuse to continue its distribution contract with Commonwealth because that contract was tainted in its procurement? If “yes,” did claimant McConnell earn the commission he claimed?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Who benefits from the court’s decision in this case: crooks, people who do business with crooks, or pharisees who have crooks do their dirty work for them? Who would have benefited if the court had affirmed the decision below?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Is it unethical for a lawyer to draft a contract that contravenes public policy? To what sanctions, if any, should the lawyer be subject? On what does your answer depend?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Reconcile (if you can) <span class="italic">McConnell</span> to a later New York case, <span class="italic">XLO Concrete Corp. v. Rivergate Corp.</span>, 634 N.E.2d 158 (N.Y. 1994). In <span class="italic">XLO,</span> the plaintiff subcontractor, XLO, sued to enforce a written contract with the defendant general contractor, Rivergate, to pour the concrete superstructure of a project in Manhattan. XLO was a member of the “Club,” an arrangement among four New York City <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page307" class="pagebreak">307</span> organized crime families and seven concrete construction companies. The Club chose which concrete companies would get which jobs and rigged the bidding to ensure that the chosen firm would win. Presumably this bid-rigging system inflated the price of concrete construction work in New York by eliminating true competitive bidding. The Club allocated the Rivergate project to XLO, which then negotiated a contract with the defendant. The defendant (like all general contractors in New York) had full knowledge of the Club and its rules. XLO completed the work as agreed, but the defendant refused to pay. The defendant contended that “the contract at issue is so integrally related to an antitrust conspiracy … that it is void and unenforceable as a matter of law.” The court rejected this contention, holding that “a contract which is legal on its face and does not call for unlawful conduct in its performance is not voidable simply because it resulted from an antitrust conspiracy.” The court stated that “courts should avoid upholding antitrust defenses in contract cases where doing so would work a substantial forfeiture on one party while unjustly enriching the other.”</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Reconsider <span class="italic">McConnell,</span> p. 301, in light of R<small>EST</small>. (2d) §§ 178-79. Do the factors in the balancing test set out in the Restatement lead you to the majority or the dissenting judges’ conclusions? Are these factors helpful in your analysis?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Note that Chief Judge Desmond expressly relied on principles of public policy predating New York’s commercial bribery statute, N.Y. Penal Code § 439. Presumably these principles fall within Rest. 2d § 179(b)(iii), unlawful interference with a protected interest, the protected interest being the fiduciary relationship between Universal and the Universal employee corrupted by McConnell’s bribe. What other sort of interests are worthy of this kind of protection, and how far does the protection go? Note the tension between the judicial policy against “restraint of trade” and the judicial policy against “interference with protected interests.” In <span class="italic">McConnell,</span> interfering with another firm’s employees violates public policy. But in other situations, public policy in favor of competition may privilege firms to interfere with their competitors’ employees by recruiting them away. California, for example, has a particularly strong public policy in favor of open competition. Accordingly, unlike the situation in New York, <span class="italic">see ABC v. Wolf</span>, p. 104, the general rule in California is that covenants not to compete executed by employees are void. Cal. Civ. Code § 16600 (“Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.”). There are two narrow exceptions to this rule, where a person sells the goodwill of a business and executes a covenant not to compete with the buyer, and where a partner agrees not to compete in anticipation of dissolution of a partnership. Cal. Civ. Code § 16601-16602. But otherwise the general rule applies. <span class="italic">Edwards v. Arthur Anderson LLP</span>, 44 Cal.4<sup>th</sup> 937 (2008). The tension between protection of existing legal and economic relationships and the promotion of free <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page309" class="pagebreak">309</span>competition will resurface in Chapter Nine when we discuss tortious interference with contractual relations.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Perhaps the most difficult area for courts in deriving and applying public policy exceptions to contract enforcement is on the basis that the agreement “impair[s] family relationships.” R<small>EST</small>.

Their respective counsel certified that this had been done and that their clients understood the meaning and legal consequences of the agreement and executed it freely and voluntarily.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page310" class="pagebreak">310</div>
<p class="indent">The couple separated in 1995, and on April 3, 1996, Candace filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage and subsequently sought spousal support. Candace acknowledged the existence of a premarital agreement in a declaration that accompanied her request for spousal support, stating that she was then investigating its validity. At the time the dissolution petition was filed, each party had a net worth of approximately $2.5 million. Candace, who had two children from a prior marriage, held a master’s degree and was an aspiring writer. Barry, who held a doctorate in pharmacology and a law degree, was a businessman with ownership interests in numerous companies and business ventures. Candace declared that her monthly gross income was $5,772, consisting of $1,352 in Social Security benefits for two children from a prior marriage, $2,000 from a brokerage account, and $2,420 in rental income. Her net monthly income was $4,233.</p>
<p class="indent">Barry sought to strike the pleading seeking support or to have a separate trial on the validity of the prenuptial agreement. The court denied the motion for separate trial, concluding that discovery on the issue of validity would overlap that on other issues and would not result in saving time or litigation costs. The court ruled that the waiver of spousal support was against public policy and thus was unenforceable,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_55" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-55" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page311" class="pagebreak">311</span> noted that the couple had maintained a lifestyle in the high $20,000 to $32,000 per month range, and ordered Barry to pay temporary spousal support of $8,500 per month.</p>
<p class="indent">On Barry’s appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed the order for temporary spousal support. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Legislature had deleted subdivision (a)(4) from section 3 of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (Uniform Act) prior to adopting the act in 1985. The omitted subdivision would have expressly permitted the parties to a premarital agreement to contract with respect to modification or elimination of spousal support. The Court of Appeal concluded, however, that the Legislature intended to leave the question of whether spousal support waivers in premarital agreements violate public policy to the courts and that there was presently no authority governing the public policy question. In reaching the latter conclusion, the court reasoned that the question had not been reconsidered after the adoption of the Family Law Act of 1969, which repealed the law permitting divorce only on a showing of fault, or in light of current law that gives both spouses equal control over management and control of community property and mandates equal division on dissolution. In the view of the Court of Appeal, the current state of family law is one that “should not per se prohibit premarital spousal support waivers or limitations. All the protection the parties need is expressly provided by the California [version of the Uniform] Act.” The Court of Appeal therefore remanded the matter to the trial court which, in the belief that such waivers were per se unenforceable, had not determined whether this agreement was enforceable under the rules set forth in section 1615 and the policies underlying the Uniform Act and the California version thereof.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_56" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-56" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup></p>

<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II. D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Article 2 of the California Uniform Premarital Agreement Act governs premarital agreements. A premarital agreement is “an agreement between prospective spouses made in contemplation of marriage and to be effective upon marriage.” Section 1612 specifies the permissible objects of a premarital agreement:</p>
<p class="list">“(a) Parties to a premarital agreement may contract with respect to all of the following:</p>
<p class="list1">(1) The rights and obligations of each of the parties in any of the property of either or both of them whenever and wherever acquired or located.</p>
<p class="list1">(2) The right to buy, sell, use, transfer, exchange, abandon, lease, consume, expend, assign, create a security interest in, mortgage, encumber, dispose of, or otherwise manage and control property.</p>
<p class="list1">(3) The disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event.</p>
<p class="list1">(4) The making of a will, trust, or other arrangement to carry out the provisions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="list1">(5) The ownership rights in and disposition of the death benefit from a life insurance policy.</p>
<p class="list1">(6) The choice of law governing the construction of the agreement.</p>
<p class="list1">(7) Any other matter, including their personal rights and obligations, not in violation of public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.</p>
<p class="list">(b) The right of a child to support may not be adversely affected by a premarital agreement.”</p>
<p class="indent">As noted, <span class="italic">ante</span>, the California version of the Uniform Act omits subdivision (a)(4) of section 3 of the Uniform Act. When first introduced on March 7, 1985, Senate Bill No. 1143, the California version of the Uniform Act, included subdivision (a)(4), and thus listed among the permissible subjects of a premarital agreement “the modification or elimination of spousal support.” The spousal support waiver provision was deleted by amendment. The amendment of Senate Bill 1143 that deleted subdivision (a)(4) simultaneously deleted a provision, subdivision (b) of section 6 of the Uniform Act, which provided: “If a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution, a court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility.” As enacted, Senate Bill 1143 became Civil Code former section 5315, now Family Code section 1612.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page313" class="pagebreak">313</div>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeal held that neither the Legislature’s deletion from the legislation of express authorization for premarital waivers of spousal support, nor past cases refusing to enforce waivers of spousal support, preclude such waivers today. The court reasoned that the legislative history of section 1612 suggested that, in omitting subdivision (a)(4) of the Uniform Act, the Legislature intended to leave the enforceability of spousal support waivers to the courts. It found support for that conclusion in two reports by the Assembly Subcommittee on Administration of Justice. The first was prepared for an August 19, 1985, hearing on Senate Bill 1143. Senate Bill 1143 repealed prior statutory law governing premarital agreements and enacted the Uniform Act. In the first report staff advised that California courts did not permit enforcement of premarital agreements on spousal support and recommended deletion “to allow California case law to continue to prevail on the issue of spousal support in premarital agreements.”</p>
<p class="indent">The second report, prepared after the amendment passed, stated that as a result of the amendment “California case law would … prevail on the issue of spousal support in premarital agreements. There is a split in authority among the states as to whether a premarital agreement may control on the issue of spousal support. Some states, such as California, do not permit a premarital agreement to control this issue. See <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Dawley</span>, 17 Cal.3d 342 (1976), in which the court notes that the enforcement of provisions in premarital contracts to waive or limit spousal support rights is barred because such provisions are considered promotive of divorce.” The Court of Appeal understood this history to mean that the Legislature recognized that enforceability of spousal support waivers is a question for the courts, not the Legislature.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time the California version of the Uniform Act was adopted, this court had held that agreements waiving the right to spousal support were unenforceable as being against public policy if the waiver would promote or encourage dissolution. This court had held in <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Higgason</span>, speaking of both spousal support and property division, that to be valid, premarital agreements must be made “in contemplation that the marriage relation will continue until the parties are separated by death. Contracts which facilitate divorce or separation by providing for a settlement only in the event of such an occurrence are void as against public policy. Insofar as an antenuptial agreement relates to the disposition of the property of the respective parties, and does not seek to alter support obligations imposed by law, it will be upheld.” At issue in <span class="italic">Higgason</span> was an agreement in which both husband and wife waived all interest in the property of the other party as well as the right to support. The court concluded that a purported waiver was invalid as against public policy insofar as the agreement sought to alter the wife’s statutory obligation to support the husband during marriage. The court also held that the agreement did not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page314" class="pagebreak">314</span>preclude exercise of the court’s discretionary power to award postdissolution support. Although the basis for the latter holding is not made clear in the opinion, it appears to be that married persons assume, by means of the marriage contract, an obligation for support that continues throughout the lifetime of the parties regardless of whether they live together or apart, and any agreement to waive that obligation is also unenforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">When the issue of enforceability of premarital agreements next arose in <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Dawley</span> (1976), where the parties had agreed before marriage that the earnings and property acquired during marriage would be held as separate property, the court concluded that <span class="italic">Higgason</span> had misstated the law in stating that premarital agreements must be made in contemplation that the marriage would continue throughout the lifetime of the parties and disapproved that <span class="italic">Higgason</span> dictum. We also explained that, apart from <span class="italic">Higgason</span>, “California courts have uniformly held that contracts offend the state policy favoring marriage only” if, objectively viewed, by its terms the contract promotes dissolution of marriage. We noted in <span class="italic">Dawley</span> that in two cases provisions in agreements that waived or limited spousal support rights had been invalidated on the basis that they promoted divorce, while other provisions containing property divisions were enforced; but <span class="italic">Dawley</span> did not endorse or otherwise approve those decisions. Notably, in <span class="italic">Dawley</span> we did not distinguish premarital agreements governing property rights and those governing spousal support. Our discussion of the enforceability of premarital agreements in no way suggested that spousal support waivers were per se unenforceable. The rule we stated was: “[A]n antenuptial agreement violates the state policy favoring marriage only insofar as its terms encourage or promote dissolution.” <sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_57" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-57" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The parties have not called our attention to any legislative history other than the two legislative reports, the latter of which did not accurately state the holding of this court in <span class="italic">Dawley</span>,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_58" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-58" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></sup> and neither of which adequately explains the legislative purpose in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page315" class="pagebreak">315</span> omitting subdivision (a)(4). Two possible interpretations of the Legislature’s intent in omitting express authority for premarital waivers of spousal support come to mind. The Legislature may have intended to deny couples the right to enter into any premarital agreement regarding spousal support by adopting what the committee report erroneously described as the existing case law under which premarital waivers would be per se unenforceable. Alternatively, the Legislature may have concluded that policy governing spousal support agreements, having been established by the court in the past, should continue to evolve in the court.</p>
<p class="indent">The public policy under which waivers of spousal support once were held unenforceable was explained in <span class="italic">Loveren v. Loveren</span> (1895): “‘The authorities are uniform in holding that any contract between the parties having for its object the dissolution of the marriage contract, or <span class="italic">facilitating that result</span>, such as an agreement by the defendant in a pending action for divorce to withdraw his or her opposition and to make no defense, is void as <span class="italic">contra bonos mores</span>’; and that courts ‘will esteem it their duty to interfere, <span class="italic">upon their own motion</span>, whenever it appears the dissolution is sought to be effected by the connivance or collusion of the parties.’” Another concern was that a man should not be able to contract before marriage against the liability to his wife that he would incur should he commit offenses against the wife during the marriage. The rule those decisions implemented found its origin in the common law, but the policy had been declared by the Legislature in 1872 with the adoption of the Civil Code. Former section 159 of the Civil Code then provided: “A husband and wife cannot, by any contract with each other, alter their legal relations, except as to property, … and except that they may agree to an immediate separation, and may make provision for the support of either of them and of their children during such separation.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_59" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-59" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Barry suggests, and we agree, that changes in the law governing the spousal relation warrant reexamination of the assumptions and policy underlying the refusal to enforce waivers of spousal support. We may not do so, however, if the Legislature <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page316" class="pagebreak">316</span> intends that section 1612 control the permissible subjects of a premarital agreement and that public policy with respect to waiver of spousal support no longer be governed by the common law subject to reconsideration and development by the courts.</p>
<p class="indent">(1) It is clear that the Legislature understood that the omission of authorization for premarital waivers of spousal support in section 1612 would leave the law as it was in 1985. The subcommittee reports reflect that understanding. We do not agree with respondent and the dissent, however, that in so doing the Legislature thereby abrogated the role of the courts in developing the law governing premarital waivers of spousal support. We will not presume that the Legislature intended that the law remain static. It would be unreasonable to assume that the Legislature intended the common law of the 19th century to govern the marital relationship in the 21st century. The most reasonable understanding of the Legislature’s purpose when it omitted subdivision (a)(4) is that it was satisfied with the evolution of the common law governing premarital waivers of spousal support and intended to permit that evolution to continue. Had the Legislature intended to forbid spousal support waivers, it is logical to assume that it would have done so by expressly including spousal support in subdivision (b) of section 1612, which reads: “The right of a child to support may not be adversely affected by a premarital agreement.” We agree with the Court of Appeal, therefore, that the court is free to reexamine the assumptions that underlie the common law rule that premarital spousal support waivers promote dissolution and for that reason contravene public policy. (2) Having done so, we also agree with the Court of Appeal that the common law policy, based on assumptions that dissolution of marriage is contrary to public policy and that premarital waivers of spousal support may promote dissolution, is anachronistic.</p>
<p class="indent">Some 41 jurisdictions have already abandoned the common law restrictions on premarital waivers of spousal support. In 21 jurisdictions, premarital waivers of spousal support are authorized by statutes that either adopt all or substantially all of the provisions of the Uniform Act. One jurisdiction (New York) had other statutory authorization for such waivers, and in another 18 the right to enforce a premarital waiver of spousal support exists pursuant to judicial decision.</p>
<p class="indent">The changes in public policy and the attitude toward marriage, already reflected in <span class="italic">Dawley</span>, are made manifest by contrasting the current statutory treatment of marriage and premarital agreements with an early decision of the Oregon Supreme Court that reflects the 19th-century view of public policy regarding marriage. “The welfare of society is so deeply interested in the preservation of the marriage relation, and so fraught with evil is regarded whatever is calculated to impair its usefulness, or designed to terminate it, that it has long been the settled policy of the law to guard and maintain it with a watchful vigilance. Although marriage, in the eye of the law, is a civil contract, unlike any other civil contract, it cannot be rescinded or annulled by consent of the parties to it. By mutual consent, if the parties are of the proper age <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page317" class="pagebreak">317</span>and capacity, the marriage relation may be created and receive the sanction of the law, but it cannot dissolve or terminate it. That high office can only be performed by a court of competent jurisdiction, for some specified cause prescribed by law, upon proof taken in a suit for that purpose. The good order and well being of society, as well as the laws of this state, require this. And so strict and careful are courts in the administration of this justice, out of regard for the public morals and the general welfare of society, that they will esteem it their duty to interfere upon their own motions whenever it appears the dissolution is sought to be effected by the connivance or collusion of the parties; and all contrivances or agreements, having for their object the termination of the marriage contract, or designed to facilitate or procure it, will be declared illegal and void as against public policy…. ‘… And when the marriage relation has been assumed, it is equally the policy of the law to sustain and uphold it. It, therefore, holds all contracts void which contemplate or provide for the future separation of the parties….’” <span class="italic">Phillips v. Thorp,</span> 10 Or. at 495-496.</p>
<p class="indent">California statutory law of the time reflected these policies and values. In 1872, divorce could be granted only on the grounds of adultery, extreme cruelty, willful desertion, willful neglect, habitual intemperance, or conviction of a felony, and could be denied on grounds, inter alia, of connivance or collusion-the “corrupt consent” by one party to the other’s commission of an act constituting cause for divorce or an agreement between the parties that one should commit, appear to commit, or represent to the court that one had committed such an act. The husband had exclusive control of the community property with “absolute power of disposition (other than testamentary) as he ha[d] of his separate estate” and a wife could not contract for the payment of money. The court was empowered to order the husband to pay alimony on divorce if the divorce was granted for an offense of the husband, but had no power to order a wife to pay alimony.</p>
<p class="indent">The assumptions underlying the refusal to enforce premarital waivers of spousal support were that the state had a vital interest in and should act to ensure the permanency of the marriage relation, and that this interest was undermined by such waivers, assumptions reflected in statutory law governing marriage, dissolution, and property rights. In <span class="italic">Dawley</span>, however, we emphasized that only agreements that on their face promote dissolution violate the public policy favoring marriage. We recognized there that contemporary attitudes toward the marriage relationship are more pragmatic: “In recent years, however, an increasing number of couples have executed antenuptial agreements in order to structure their legal relationship in a manner more suited to their needs and values. Neither the reordering of property rights to fit the needs and desires of the couple, nor realistic planning that takes account of the possibility of dissolution, offends the public policy favoring and protecting marriage. It is only when the terms of an agreement go further-when they promote and encourage dissolution, and thereby threaten to induce the destruction <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page318" class="pagebreak">318</span>of a marriage that might otherwise endure-that such terms offend public policy.” <span class="italic">Dawley</span>, 17 Cal.3d at 358.</p>
<p class="indent">Both public attitude and contemporary official policy have changed substantially over the past century. Public policy continues to favor and encourage marriage, but it now acknowledges that lifetime commitment is no longer the norm. When legitimate grounds for dissolution exist, dissolution does not contravene public policy, but is the preferred solution. The adoption of the California Uniform Premarital Agreement Act itself reflects recognition that permanency is no longer a dominant characteristic of modern marriage. The Family Law Act of 1969 permitted, and now the Family Code permits, no-fault dissolution. A stipulation governing division of community property, once held in reliance on <span class="italic">Phillips v. Thorp</span> to be collusive and to violate public policy, today is expressly allowed, encouraged, and no longer condemned as facilitating dissolution. Spouses who are separated have long been permitted to contract with regard to division of property and to include provisions for spousal support on dissolution, even when community property was evenly divided and thus the division was not consideration for the modification of spousal support rights. The right of husband and wife to agree in writing to separate and provide for spousal support both during separation and on dissolution of the marriage continues to be expressly recognized by statute.</p>
<p class="indent">Legal recognition also has been given to the changing position of married women who, in increasing numbers, are employed outside the home and have been given equal right to management of the property of the community as well as primary right to manage businesses they are operating. Public policy toward spousal support has also changed. While spouses must support each other during marriage, the court has been given greater discretion in marital dissolutions to deny spousal support altogether or to limit such support in an amount and duration that reflects the ability of both parties in contemporary unions to provide for their own needs. The changing attitudes are reflected in the 1969 repeal of former section 139 of the Civil Code, which authorized the court to award lifetime support if a divorce was based on an offense of the husband. The underlying theory, we explained was then “‘that the husband entered upon an obligation which bound him to support his wife during the period of their joint lives, that by his own wrong he has forced her to sever the relation which enabled her to compel the performance of this duty, and that he is required to make compensation for the offense committed by him which has deprived her of the benefit of the obligation.’” <span class="italic">Webber v. Webber</span> (1948) 33 Cal.2d 153, 157-158. Today, however, a court ordering spousal support must consider, inter alia, “[t]he goal that the supported party shall be self-supporting within a reasonable period of time.” The law has thus progressed from a rule that entitled some women to lifelong alimony as a condition of the marital contract of support to one that entitles <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page319" class="pagebreak">319</span>either spouse to postdissolution support for only so long as necessary to become selfsupporting.</p>
<p class="indent">These changes in the relationship between spouses and support obligations in particular, accurately described by the Court of Appeal as “dramatic” and by a legal commentator as a “sea change” (Ellman, <span class="italic">The Theory of Alimony</span> (1989) 77 Cal. L.Rev. 1, 7), clearly warrant reassessment of what remains of the rule that premarital waivers of spousal support may promote dissolution and, if they do so, are unenforceable. Public policy, to the extent that it is reflected in these legislative acts, no longer reflects concern that premarital waivers of property rights threaten the marriage relationship. Section 1612 expressly permits the parties to contract with regard to numerous property rights, including “[t]he disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event.” No basis appears on which to distinguish premarital waivers of spousal support from agreements governing property rights insofar as either has a potential for promoting dissolution. As the Court of Appeal recognized, today the availability of an enforceable premarital agreement “may in fact encourage rather than discourage marriage.” We agree with the Court of Appeal, therefore, that, when entered into voluntarily by parties who are aware of the effect of the agreement, a premarital waiver of spousal support does not offend contemporary public policy. Such agreements are, therefore, permitted under section 1612, subdivision (a)(7), which authorizes the parties to contract in a premarital agreement regarding “[a]ny other matter, including their personal rights and obligations, not in violation of public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.”</p>
<p class="indent">We need not decide here whether circumstances existing at the time enforcement of a waiver of spousal support is sought might make enforcement unjust.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_60" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-60" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></sup> It is enough to conclude here that no public policy is violated by permitting enforcement of a waiver of spousal support executed by intelligent, well-educated persons, each of whom appears to be self-sufficient in property and earning ability, and both of whom have the advice of counsel regarding their rights and obligations as marital partners at the time they execute the waiver. Such a waiver does not violate public policy and is not per se unenforceable as the trial court believed.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III. D<small>ISPOSITION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>
<p class="indent">Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., Hastings, J., concurred.</p>

<p class="noindent-squ1">■ M<small>OSK</small>, J. and A<small>CTING</small> C.J.: I concur in the result.</p>
<p class="indent">The relevant statute provides that premarital agreements may concern any subject that does not violate public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty. When a statute’s words are “clear and unambiguous our inquiry ends. There is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge in it.” (<span class="italic">Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court</span> (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1047.) That is true here. Any lingering question whether the Legislature intended to omit premarital spousal support agreements from the scope of Family Code section 1612 is dispelled by subdivision (b), which prohibits premarital agreements to waive or reduce child support. Had the Legislature desired to prohibit spousal support agreements, it could have added a few words similar to those of subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly, the parties did not conspire to violate the criminal law. The only question is whether their premarital agreement violated public policy. I agree with the majority that it did not.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ K<small>ENNARD</small>, J.: I dissent.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Higgason</span>, this court unanimously held that premarital agreements waiving spousal support in the event of separation or dissolution of the marriage violate California’s public policy and are therefore invalid, leaving it to the trial court to determine at the time of separation or dissolution whether to award spousal support. Three years later, in <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Dawley</span> (1976), this court, again unanimously, came to the same conclusion. Our Legislature was fully aware of these decisions when in 1985, in adopting provisions of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, it chose to omit the act’s provision allowing premarital waiver of spousal support, thus affirming the decisional law of this state that such waivers violate public policy.</p>
<p class="indent">In overruling by judicial fiat the Legislature’s decision to continue this state’s prohibition against premarital waivers of spousal support, the majority has (1) invaded the legislative domain, (2) invalidated a legislative decision reflecting sound public policy, and (3) failed to articulate an intelligible standard to guide members of the bench and bar in determining whether a premarital waiver of spousal support is or will be enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot and do not join the majority in its usurpation of legislative powers. Any change in the law at issue should come from the Legislature, not the judiciary.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">California statutory law generally imposes an obligation to support one’s spouse.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1985, California became one of the first states to adopt provisions of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act. Uniform acts are drafted by the National <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page321" class="pagebreak">321</span>Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws “to promote uniformity in state law, on all subjects where uniformity is desirable and practicable, by voluntary action of each state government.”</p>
<p class="indent">On March 7, 1985, Senate Bill No. 1143 was introduced in our Legislature. The bill proposed adopting the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act in its entirety. On August 28, 1985, however, the bill was amended to <span class="italic">delete</span> these two provisions of the act:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Section 3, subdivision (a)(4), allowing spousal support to be modified or eliminated through premarital agreements<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_61" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-61" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> and Section 6, subdivision (b), providing that if, as a result of having entered into an a premarital agreement waiving spousal support, a spouse at the time of separation or marital dissolution becomes impoverished and eligible for public assistance, then a court retains the authority to award support “to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_62" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-62" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">When the Legislature deleted these two provisions from Senate Bill No. 1143, two decisions of this court, <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Higgason</span> and <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Dawley</span>, had held roughly a decade earlier that premarital agreements waiving spousal support violated California’s public policy and were therefore invalid. At the time of the deletion and until today’s decision by the majority, it was the trial court that determined whether to award spousal support, depending on the circumstances existing at the time of separation or dissolution of the marriage. (See Fam. Code, § 4320 [circumstances trial court should consider in awarding spousal support].)</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page322" class="pagebreak">322</div>
<p class="indent">Does the Legislature’s deletion of the provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support establish its intent to preclude such waivers? The answer is “yes,” as I explain below.</p>
<p class="indent">On point is this court’s decision in <span class="italic">Kusior v. Silver</span> (1960). There, as here, the Legislature was considering the adoption of a uniform act. There, the Legislature had refused to enact into law a provision of the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity allowing blood tests to show that the husband was not the father of the child. There, as here, California decisional law was contrary to the proposed provision.</p>
<p class="indent">This court in <span class="italic">Kusior</span> observed that “[s]tatutes are to be interpreted by assuming that the Legislature was aware of the existing judicial decisions.” We then held that in omitting from its adoption of the uniform act at issue a provision directly at odds with this state’s decisional law, the Legislature’s omission “must be deemed” an intent to approve and retain the decisional law. Similarly, here the Legislature’s express rejection of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act’s provision allowing premarital spousal support waivers, in the face of decisional law to the contrary, “must be deemed” an intent to approve and retain the existing law. (See also <span class="italic">Estate of Sanders</span> (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 462, 473-474 [“‘[t]he rejection by the Legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision’”].)</p>
<p class="indent">This court’s decision in <span class="italic">Kusior</span> is dispositive here. Under the reasoning of that decision, our Legislature’s express rejection of the proposed uniform law provision allowing waivers of spousal support was a decision to approve and retain California’s rule prohibiting such waivers. By now deciding that premarital spousal support waivers do not violate California’s public policy, the majority has invaded the legislative domain, judicially enacting in substance a provision that the Legislature intended to reject, and judicially abrogating the rule that the Legislature intended to retain.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Our Legislature’s decision not to enact into law the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act’s provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support, while adopting other provisions of the act, reflects sound public policy.</p>
<p class="indent">Such waivers do not allow for changed circumstances between execution of the premarital agreement and separation or dissolution of the marriage. An agreement equitable at the time of the marriage may later become inequitable and unjust. For example, the health, earning capacity, or financial resources of a spouse may change markedly during the marriage, especially one that is lengthy. An elderly spouse or one in poor health may be left destitute. The earning capacity of a spouse may be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page323" class="pagebreak">323</span>impaired by the obligations of caring for children produced by a marriage of short duration. After the marriage one spouse may elect to give up his or her career to raise the children of the marriage or to move to another location in the interest of furthering the career of the other spouse. And a spouse may substantially deplete his or her financial resources to advance the other spouse’s education, training, or career during the marriage.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_63" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-63" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">These considerations are reflected in the Legislature’s enactment of Family Code section 4320, which sets forth spousal support guidelines for the trial courts.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_64" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-64" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page324" class="pagebreak">324</span>They are also reflected in the Legislature’s express declarations that spousal support is a “serious legal obligation[ ]” and that it “is the policy of the State of California” to “ensure fair and sufficient” spousal support awards. In rejecting the proposed provision to allow premarital waivers of spousal support, the Legislature must have recognized the serious potential for injustice at the time of dissolution of marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">That concern was succinctly expressed in a letter the Women Lawyers’ Association of Los Angeles wrote on June 6, 1985 to Elihu Harris, the Chair of the Assembly Judiciary Committee, stating its opposition to that part of Senate Bill No. 1143 proposing adoption of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act’s provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support: “The bill would change existing California law, which does not enforce premarital waivers of spousal support, to allow such waivers under certain conditions. Current California law allows spouses to waive spousal support only at the time of separation, when they are much more aware of what they have contributed to and sacrificed for the marriage as well as their prospects for self-support following the separation. California law regards the duty to support one’s spouse as an essential incident of marriage and refuses to confer the benefits of marriage on those who would avoid this obligation. Although numerous states have adopted the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, California’s position represents sounder public policy and should not be sacrificed to achieve uniformity.”</p>
<p class="indent">In a letter to the Legislature on August 14, 1985, the Family Law Section of the State Bar of California echoed that concern. In opposing the proposed provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support, the Family Law Section warned that such an enactment “would be a major change in California law” and “a great step backward in terms of assuring that the financial consequences of a dissolution of marriage are borne by both spouses in an equitable manner.”</p>
<p class="indent">In sharp contrast to the thoughtful action by the Legislature, which after the letters quoted above deleted the proposed provision allowing premarital waivers of spousal support, the majority ignores the significant public policy considerations that prompted the Legislature to retain our existing law prohibiting such waivers.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page325" class="pagebreak">325</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">After repudiating the existing law of this state prohibiting all premarital waivers of spousal support, the majority abdicates its responsibility to articulate guidelines for the bench and bar explaining when, if ever, such waivers are enforceable. The majority declares that it will <span class="italic">not</span> decide “whether all such agreements [premarital agreements waiving spousal support] are enforceable regardless of the circumstances of the parties at the time enforcement is sought” and that it will <span class="italic">not</span> decide “whether circumstances existing at the time enforcement of a waiver of spousal support is sought might make enforcement unjust.”</p>
<p class="indent">Given the majority’s “holding” that such provisions may or may not be enforceable depending upon circumstances the majority refuses to discuss, what guidance is there for attorneys preparing a premarital agreement to decide whether to include a waiver of spousal support? And what guidance is there for trial courts in determining the enforceability of such agreements? If enforcement of a premarital waiver of spousal support results in a spouse’s becoming eligible for public assistance, should the trial court order spousal support limited to the amount necessary to avoid such eligibility, as provided for in the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act? Or should the trial court in that instance continue to apply the considerations the Legislature has specified in Family Code section 4320? The majority’s silence on these important questions does a disservice to the public, the bar, and the bench.</p>
<p class="indent">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p id="sec144" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Notwithstanding this attempt byp “intelligent, well-educated persons, each of whom appears to be self-sufficient in property and earning ability, and both of whom have the advice of counsel regarding their rights and obligations as marital partners,” to specify their respective rights and obligations upon dissolution in a formal written premarital agreement, Candace Pendleton and Barry Fireman’s divorce proceedings generated two subsequent unpublished California Court of Appeal decisions relating to property division. <span class="italic">In toto</span>, their divorce proceedings lasted twice as long as their 42 month marriage. What does that teach you about the limits of one’s ability to plan through premarital agreements?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The enforceability of waivers of spousal support remains controversial in California. Following the California Supreme Court’s decision in <span class="italic">Marriage of Pendleton</span>, the California legislature amended Family Code § 1612 to provide:</p>
<p class="list">(c) Any provision in a premarital agreement regarding spousal support, including, but not limited to, a waiver of it, is not enforceable if the party against <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page326" class="pagebreak">326</span>whom enforcement of the spousal support provision is sought was not represented by independent counsel at the time the agreement containing the provision was signed, or if the provision regarding spousal support is unconscionable at the time of enforcement. An otherwise unenforceable provision in a premarital agreement regarding spousal support may not become enforceable solely because the party against whom enforcement is sought was represented by independent counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Rosendale</span>, 119 Cal. App. 4th 1202 (2004), <span class="italic">review granted and opinion depublished,</span> 2004 Cal. LEXIS 9655, <span class="italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 31 Cal. Rptr. 3d 95 (2005), the California Court of Appeal described the situation it faced as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote">A man and a woman entered into a premarital agreement shortly before their marriage. Eight years later, the woman was in a life-shattering automobile accident. At one point pronounced dead, the woman survived the accident. However, she suffered brain damage, internal injuries and numerous broken bones. She underwent fifteen reconstructive surgeries and is slated to have many more. A couple of years after the accident, her husband decided to move on. He filed a petition for dissolution of marriage … [and] sought a determination that the waiver of spousal support [in the premarital agreement] was enforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court of Appeal denied enforcement of the spousal support waiver on the ground that enforcement would be unconscionable given the spouses’ circumstances at the time of the dissolution, even though the premarital agreement in question (i) pre-dated the post-<span class="italic">Pendleton</span> amendment codified in Family Code § 1612(c) and (ii) did not appear to be unconscionable at the time it was executed. The California Supreme Court granted a petition for review but thereafter dismissed the appeal without addressing the case on the merits. As a matter of California procedure, dismissal of the appeal after a grant of review leaves the judgment below intact, but it negates the precedential force of the Court of Appeal opinion. What does <span class="italic">Rosendale</span> teach you about the limits of one’s ability to plan through premarital agreements? More recently, the California Court of Appeal refused to apply <span class="italic">Pendleton</span> to a prenuptial agreement executed in 1985, prior to California’s adoption of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, asserting that as of the time of the agreement, California law was clear that spousal support waivers were per se unenforceable. <span class="italic">In re Marriage of Melissa</span>, 212 Cal. App. 4<sup>th</sup> 598, <span class="italic">review denied</span>, 2013 Cal. LEXIS 2281 (2013). Should the obligations of the parties to a premarital agreement be assessed by reference to the state of the law at the time of the agreement or at the time of enforcement? If public policy that would have been a bar to enforcement at the time the agreement was made no longer applies hasn’t the obstacle to the enforcement of the agreement been removed? If at the time of enforcement, the agreement violates then existing public policy shouldn’t the court <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page327" class="pagebreak">327</span>refuse enforcement? How can a court today even know what public policy would or would not have permitted 30 years ago? Isn’t it hard enough to figure out what public policy today is? Isn’t the real issue, as set out by the California legislature in amended section 1612(c), what is just as between the parties today given the agreement between them <span class="bold"><span class="italic">and</span></span> the other relevant circumstances as they exist at the time of dissolution?</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">Our legal system gives high priority to the enforcement of contracts, and this supports basic social and political values. We place a great value on individual autonomy, choice, and voluntary association as the basis of human relationship. Individualism, rationalism, and democracy all connote a large role for personal choices. But of course, for most people in most places and during most of human history, those choices simply were not available. Status, class, caste, and gender have determined the content of most human relationships, not choice. Today most people are more insistent on the primacy of choice, but perhaps in consequence we face real uncertainty regarding the content of some of the most intimate human relationships. Recall the changing nature of the marital relationship discussed in <span class="italic">Marriage of Pendleton</span>, p. 309. Society is unsure how to structure such relationships by consent and how power and obligation within the family should be organized. We also are unsure who should do the organizing. To what extent should the state set the rules, and when should it be tolerant of other rules the parties may agree to among themselves?</p>
<p class="indent">We are often obligated even when we do not promise. Some agreements are outside of contract and are not legally enforceable because they grow out of a relationship that has a predefined content, a status. That status may be dominant, as in the case of marriage, even though the law has only imperfectly defined its content. Family members, for example, rightly feel special obligations toward one another. Our sense of commitment is likely to extend more broadly to those whose lives touch ours. Relationships may not only precede promises and impose obligations outside of promise, but may also exclude legally binding promises and deprive those in the relationship from the capacity to organize their dealings by binding promises to one another.</p>

<p id="sec146" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Tenet v. Doe</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Supreme Court of the United States, 2005.</p>
<p class="sectionb">544 U.S. 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ R<small>EHNQUIST</small>, C.J. delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Totten v. United States,</span> 92 U.S. 105 (1876), we held that public policy forbade a self-styled Civil War spy from suing the United States to enforce its obligations under their secret espionage agreement. Respondents here, alleged former Cold War spies, filed suit against the United States and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asserting estoppel and due process claims for the CIA’s alleged failure to provide respondents with the assistance it had promised in return for their espionage services. Finding that <span class="italic">Totten</span> did not bar respondents’ suit, the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the case could proceed. We reverse because this holding contravenes the longstanding rule, announced more than a century ago in <span class="italic">Totten,</span> prohibiting suits against the Government based on covert espionage agreements.</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents, a husband and wife who use the fictitious names John and Jane Doe, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_65" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-65" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> According to respondents, they were formerly citizens of a foreign country that at the time was considered to be an enemy of the United States, and John Doe was a high-ranking diplomat for the country. After respondents expressed interest in defecting to the United States, CIA agents persuaded them to remain at their posts and conduct espionage for the United States for a specified period of time, promising in return that the Government “would arrange for travel to the United States and ensure financial and personal security for life.” After “carrying out their end of the bargain” by completing years of purportedly high-risk, valuable espionage services, respondents defected (under new names and false backgrounds) and became United States citizens, with the Government’s help. The CIA designated respondents with “PL-110” status and began providing financial assistance and personal security.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_66" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-66" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page329" class="pagebreak">329</div>
<p class="indent">With the CIA’s help, respondent John Doe obtained employment in the State of Washington. As his salary increased, the CIA decreased his living stipend until, at some point, he agreed to a discontinuation of benefits while he was working. Years later, in 1997, John Doe was laid off after a corporate merger. Because John Doe was unable to find new employment as a result of CIA restrictions on the type of jobs he could hold, respondents contacted the CIA for financial assistance.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_67" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-67" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> Denied such assistance by the CIA, they claim they are unable to properly provide for themselves. Thus, they are faced with the prospect of either returning to their home country (where they say they face extreme sanctions), or remaining in the United States in their present circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents assert, among other things, that the CIA violated their procedural and substantive due process rights by denying them support and by failing to provide them with a fair internal process for reviewing their claims. They seek injunctive relief ordering the CIA to resume monthly financial support pending further agency review. They also request a declaratory judgment stating that the CIA failed to provide a constitutionally adequate review process, and detailing the minimal process the agency must provide. Finally, respondents seek a mandamus order requiring the CIA to adopt agency procedures, to give them fair review, and to provide them with security and financial assistance.</p>
<p class="indent">The Government moved to dismiss the complaint, principally on the ground that <span class="italic">Totten</span> bars respondents’ suit. The District Court dismissed some of respondents’ claims but denied the Government’s <span class="italic">Totten</span> objection, ruling that the due process claims could proceed. After minimal discovery, the Government renewed its motion to dismiss based on <span class="italic">Totten,</span> and it moved for summary judgment on respondents’ due process claims. Apparently construing the complaint as also raising an estoppel claim, the District Court denied the Government’s motions, ruled again that <span class="italic">Totten</span> did not bar respondents’ claims, and found there were genuine issues of material fact warranting a trial on respondents’ due process and estoppel claims. The District Court certified an order for interlocutory appeal ….</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page330" class="pagebreak">330</div>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Totten,</span> the administrator of William A. Lloyd’s estate brought suit against the United States to recover compensation for services that Lloyd allegedly rendered as a spy during the Civil War. Lloyd purportedly entered into a contract with President Lincoln in July 1861 to spy behind Confederate lines on troop placement and fort plans, for which he was to be paid $200 a month. The lower court had found that Lloyd performed on the contract but did not receive full compensation. After concluding with “no difficulty,” that the President had the authority to bind the United States to contracts with secret agents, we observed that the very essence of the alleged contract between Lloyd and the Government was that it was secret, and had to remain so:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“The service stipulated by the contract was a secret service; the information sought was to be obtained clandestinely, and was to be communicated privately; the employment and the service were to be equally concealed. Both employer and agent must have understood that the lips of the other were to be for ever sealed respecting the relation of either to the matter. This condition of the engagement was implied from the nature of the employment, and is implied in all secret employments of the government in time of war, or upon matters affecting our foreign relations, where a disclosure of the service might compromise or embarrass our government in its public duties, or endanger the person or injure the character of the agent.”</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, we thought it entirely incompatible with the nature of such a contract that a former spy could bring suit to enforce it.</p>
<p class="indent">We think the Court of Appeals was quite wrong in holding that <span class="italic">Totten</span> does not require dismissal of respondents’ claims. That court, and respondents here, reasoned first that <span class="italic">Totten</span> developed merely a contract rule, prohibiting breach-ofcontract claims seeking to enforce the terms of espionage agreements but not barring claims based on due process or estoppel theories. In fact, <span class="italic">Totten</span> was not so limited: “[P]ublic policy forbids the maintenance of <span class="italic">any suit</span> in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential.” (emphasis added); [and, “The secrecy which such contracts impose precludes <span class="italic">any action</span> for their enforcement.” (emphasis added)]. No matter the clothing in which alleged spies dress their claims, <span class="italic">Totten</span> precludes judicial review in cases such as respondents’ where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the Government.</p>
<p class="indent">Relying mainly on <span class="italic">United States v. Reynolds,</span> 345 U.S. 1 (1953), the Court of Appeals also claimed that <span class="italic">Totten</span> has been recast simply as an early expression of the evidentiary “state secrets” privilege, rather than a categorical bar to their claims. <span class="italic">Reynolds</span> involved a wrongful-death action brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act by the widows of three civilians who died in the crash of a military B-29 aircraft. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page331" class="pagebreak">331</span> In the course of discovery, the plaintiffs sought certain investigation-related documents, which the Government said contained “highly secret,” privileged military information. We recognized “the privilege against revealing military secrets, a privilege which is well established in the law of evidence,” and we set out a balancing approach for courts to apply in resolving Government claims of privilege. We ultimately concluded that the Government was entitled to the privilege in that case.</p>
<p class="indent">When invoking the “well established” state secrets privilege, we indeed looked to <span class="italic">Totten.</span> See also Brief for United States in <span class="italic">United States v. Reynolds</span> (citing <span class="italic">Totten</span> in support of a military secrets privilege). But that in no way signaled our retreat from <span class="italic">Totten’s</span> broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged espionage agreements are altogether forbidden. Indeed, our opinion in <span class="italic">Reynolds</span> refutes this very suggestion: Citing <span class="italic">Totten</span> as a case “where the very subject matter of the action, a contract to perform espionage, was a matter of state secret,” we declared that such a case was to be “dismissed <span class="italic">on the pleadings without ever reaching the question of evidence,</span> since it was so obvious that the action should never prevail over the privilege.” (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="indent">In a later case, we again credited the more sweeping holding in <span class="italic">Totten,</span> thus confirming its continued validity. See <span class="italic">Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw./Peace Ed. Project</span> (citing <span class="italic">Totten</span> in holding that “whether or not the Navy has complied with [the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969] ‘to the fullest extent possible’ is beyond judicial scrutiny in this case,” where, “[d]ue to national security reasons,” the Navy could “neither admit nor deny” the fact that was central to the suit, <span class="italic">i.e.,</span> “that it propose[d] to store nuclear weapons” at a facility). <span class="italic">Reynolds</span> therefore cannot plausibly be read to have replaced the categorical <span class="italic">Totten</span> bar with the balancing of the state secrets evidentiary privilege in the distinct class of cases that depend upon clandestine spy relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor does <span class="italic">Webster v. Doe,</span> 486 U.S. 592 (1988), support respondents’ claim. There, we held that [the National Security Act of 1947], may not be read to exclude judicial review of the constitutional claims made by a former CIA employee for alleged discrimination. In reaching that conclusion, we noted the “‘serious constitutional question’ that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.” But there is an obvious difference, for purposes of <span class="italic">Totten,</span> between a suit brought by an acknowledged (though covert) employee of the CIA and one filed by an alleged former spy. Only in the latter scenario is <span class="italic">Totten’s</span> core concern implicated: preventing the existence of the plaintiff’s relationship with the Government from being revealed.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_68" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-68" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup> That is why the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page332" class="pagebreak">332</span>CIA regularly entertains Title VII claims concerning the hiring and promotion of its employees, as we noted in <span class="italic">Webster</span>, yet <span class="italic">Totten</span> has long barred suits such as respondents’.</p>
<p class="indent">There is, in short, no basis for respondents’ and the Court of Appeals’ view that the <span class="italic">Totten</span> bar has been reduced to an example of the state secrets privilege.</p>
<p class="indent">We adhere to <span class="italic">Totten.</span> The state secrets privilege and the more frequent use of <span class="italic">in camera</span> judicial proceedings simply cannot provide the absolute protection we found necessary in enunciating the <span class="italic">Totten</span> rule. The possibility that a suit may proceed and an espionage relationship may be revealed, if the state secrets privilege is found not to apply, is unacceptable: “Even a small chance that some court will order disclosure of a source’s identity could well impair intelligence gathering and cause sources to ‘close up like a clam.’” Forcing the Government to litigate these claims would also make it vulnerable to “graymail,” <span class="italic">i.e.,</span> individual lawsuits brought to induce the CIA to settle a case (or prevent its filing) out of fear that any effort to litigate the action would reveal classified information that may undermine ongoing covert operations. And requiring the Government to invoke the privilege on a case-by-case basis risks the perception that it is either confirming or denying relationships with individual plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="sectionb">54 Ohio App. 303, 6 N.E.2d 987.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ M<small>ATTHEWS</small>, J. This is an appeal on questions of law from the court of common pleas of Hamilton county.</p>
<p class="indent">The appellant, John C. Woods, was the son of Susan L.B. Woods, and filed this action against the executor of her last will to recover for personal services rendered by him during the six years immediately preceding her death.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page333" class="pagebreak">333</div>
<p class="indent">The decedent, Susan L.B. Woods, during that period lived at the Hotel Alms, and the appellant lived with his family about one mile distant therefrom. The services, so far as the evidence shows, consisted in personal attention and in assisting her in managing her property, consisting apparently of securities of the value of about $80,000.</p>
<p class="indent">At the close of the plaintiff’s evidence the court sustained the defendant’s motion for an instructed verdict. The court overruled the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial and entered judgment on the verdict.</p>
<p class="indent">The appeal presents for determination the question whether the court erred in sustaining the motion for an instructed verdict.</p>
<p class="indent">We are of [the] opinion that no promise, implied in law or fact, arises from the performance of personal services by a son for the benefit of his mother, regardless of whether they are living together as a part of the same household. The relation of parent and child is so close that the implication arises that whatever service the one renders to the other, the same is performed without expectation of compensation on the part of the one rendering the service.</p>
<p class="indent">The common experience of mankind is that a son in rendering such service does it because of the moral duty which he owes to his mother.</p>
<p class="indent">While a son owes no legal duty to perform gratuitous personal service for his mother who is financially able to pay, it is commonly recognized that the performance of such service springs from other motives than the desire for material gain. There are duties of imperfect obligation not enforceable at law that govern the relation of parent and child in such matters. Personal attention and service rendered by one to the other usually result from the recognition of such duties, or from the sheer desire to be of service, and do not arise from the purpose of creating a legal obligation. Therefore, the implication is that there was no intention to create a legal obligation by words and acts passing between them.</p>
<p class="indent">No implied promise arising by the performance on the one hand, and the receipt of the benefit thereof on the other, there must be additional evidence of an intention to contract if a legal obligation to compensate is to attach. There must be an express promise made under such circumstances as to manifest an intention of contracting. And it is not sufficient that the evidence of such a promise is such that reasonable minds could reasonably draw different conclusions therefrom on the subject, which is the general rule in the ordinary civil action, as decided in the case of <span class="italic">Hamden Lodge v. Ohio Fuel Gas Co.</span>, 127 Ohio St. 469. In this sort of a case the evidence of a promise made under such circumstances as to manifest an intention to contract must be clear and convincing.</p>
<p class="indent">Now what is the evidence of an express promise made with the intention of assuming a legal obligation to pay for these personal services?</p>

<p class="indent">One witness testified that she had heard testatrix say that her son “was to be paid for his services”; another said that he had heard her say that “her son John was taking care of her business and that he would be paid for his services.” Three witnesses testified that they had heard the testatrix say to her son, the plaintiff, when he did things for her, “that she would pay him for everything he did.” And this was all the evidence on that subject.</p>
<p class="indent">Now considering the surrounding circumstances, can it be said as a matter of law that this is not clear and convincing evidence?</p>
<p class="indent">Promissory language does not under all circumstances manifest an intent to contract. In 1 Williston on Contracts (Revised Ed.) 36 and 37, it is said:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Consequently, if both parties indicate that their words are merely in joke, no contract will be formed. So where words appropriate to an offer are used evidently merely as a boast or explosion of wrath so that no reasonable person would be justified in taking them literally, no contract will result from an acceptance. But if, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would understand the words used as importing that the speaker promised to do something if given a requested exchange therefor, it is immaterial what intention the offeror may have had.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">New York Trust Co. v. Island Oil &amp; Transport Corporation</span> the court said:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">However, the form of utterance chosen is never final; it is always possible to show that the parties did not intend to perform what they said they would, as, for example that the transaction is a joke (<span class="italic">Keller v. Holderman</span>); or that it arose in relations between the members of a family which forbade it. It is quite true that contracts depend upon the meaning which the law imputes to the utterances, not upon what the parties actually intended; but, in ascertaining what meaning to impute, the circumstances in which the words are used is always relevant and usually indispensable. The standard is what a normally constituted person would have understood them to mean, when used in their actual setting.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, if a reasonable person would understand the words used as importing a promise with contractual intent to do something, the secret intent of the person uttering the words would be of no legal significance. But in determining whether a reasonable person would so understand the words, all the circumstances must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">We have here words used by a mother to her son. She needed his attention and had natural claims to it. She had an estate and unless she provided otherwise by will he would inherit half of it. She had a complete legal right to entirely disinherit him, and his neglect of her might have caused her to exercise that right.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page335" class="pagebreak">335</div>
<p class="indent">She stated on many occasions that he would be paid or that she would pay him for everything he did. Did that language clearly and convincingly indicate any particular mode of compensation? Did it indicate contractual and not testamentary provision, or the benefit he would receive on intestacy? According to all the dictionaries there is no specific method necessarily conveyed in the meaning of the word “pay.” The only essential meaning conveyed is that of recompense or compensation. The duty discharged may be either a legal or moral one. Illustrating the meaning Webster says: “Hence, to compensate justly; to requite according to merit; to reward or punish as required; to retort or retaliate on.”</p>
<p class="indent">It seems to us clear as a matter of law that the use of such language by a mother to her son under the circumstances cannot be said to prove a contract between them by clear and convincing evidence. It proves an intention “to requite according to merit; to reward or punish as required.” The intent disclosed by such language is fully satisfied by adequate provision in a will. That the son did not regard it as a contract requiring satisfaction during the mother’s lifetime is demonstrated by the fact that no demand was ever made by him during her lifetime, and the claim now asserted extends over the entire period allowed by the statute of limitations. If a contract existed, he allowed half of his claim to become barred by lapse of time.</p>
<p class="indent">With reference to such language between members of a family, this court, in <span class="italic">Arns, Ex’r v. Disser</span> said:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Giving the declarations here their full force and effect, they are but expressions of gratitude, and an intention to do something for Disser, all of which she did by deeding him the blacksmith shop property and providing the bequest for him in the first will she executed (though she later revoked this bequest) and in furnishing him a home with free board.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">We are unable to find any expression or any conduct that would furnish clear and convincing proof of an express contract on the part of Disser to perform the services for compensation, or on the part of Mrs. Arns, when accepting the services, that she was to pay for them.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case at bar the evidence shows that the plaintiff received far more by the provisions of the will than the amount claimed. It is true that his sister was given one-half of the estate. The fact does not in any way detract from the fact that he was given more than his claim. The motives for the testamentary provisions are immaterial, as is also a comparison of them.</p>
<p class="indent">For these reasons, the judgment is affirmed.</p>

Suppose John Woods were a professional property manager? Same result if John Woods were not Susan Woods’ son but merely an old friend?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If John managed his mother’s affairs for a year and then brought suit for the reasonable value of his services when she refused his demand for payment, what result?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Lawyers, doctors, and investment advisors are frequently subjected to people seeking advice in a social setting. Sometimes you can turn away these requests with the suggestion that they telephone you at the office next Monday morning, but sometimes you can’t. When your friend, the orthodontist, seeks your advice about his complex tax problems during the third set of your Sunday tennis game, can you recover for the value of your legal services? Does your answer depend on how good a friend he is? Doesn’t living in a world made up of families, friends, and communities imply that we will do things for each other without expecting payment in return from other members of our little community? Does your answer regarding the orthodontist’s tax advice depend on whether he takes care of your children’s teeth and how much he charges?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Is the court saying that Mrs. Woods did not make an enforceable promise or that she made one but performed it in full? Suppose that she had cut John off in her will without a cent. Same result here?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. What result if Susan Woods’ promise to John had been for a specific amount, e.g., to pay John $5,000 on her death for his property management services during her lifetime, and she had cut him off without a cent?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Social mores regarding care of elderly family members have evolved substantially since the time of <span class="italic">Woods</span>, but the issue of when family duty leaves off and contract begins remains with us. <span class="italic">Caregiving in the United States</span> (2015), a study sponsored by the National Alliance for Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons, estimates that 34.2 million American adults provide unpaid care to elderly and disabled adult relatives. The “typical” caregiver is a 52-year old married woman with some college education who reports providing on average 24.4 hours of care per week for her widowed mother. Forty-eight percent of caregivers furnishing more than 20 hours of care weekly were employed in addition to giving care. Caregivers overall averaged 34.7 hours per week at their jobs. The median household income of those furnishing more than 20 hours of care weekly was $45,700. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page337" class="pagebreak">337</span> Nearly one-quarter of caregivers provide 41 or more hours per week of unpaid care. Rachel Emma Silverman, <span class="italic">Who Will Mind Mom? Check Her Contract</span>, W<small>ALL</small> S<small>T</small>. J., Sept. 7, 2006, at D1, reports on an increasing trend for families with elderly dependents to enter into written “caregiver contracts.” One force driving this trend is the Medicaid program. Medicaid is “means-tested,” and payments under the caregiver contract, by reducing the dependent person’s assets, may allow the dependent to qualify for government-paid healthcare under the Medicaid program. But many advisors, noting the difficulty in enforcing informal compensation arrangements such as that alleged in <span class="italic">Woods</span>, recommend formal written caregiver contracts specifically to avoid squabbles and will contests among caregiving and non-caregiving heirs and to provide a clear legal basis to compensate children and other relatives who devote significant time, effort, and money to the care of dependent elderly relatives. Nevertheless, as one California lawyer, Michael Gilfix, remarked to the <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span>, a certain stigma and resistance to contracting in this realm remains: “People are still uncomfortable with the idea that you are paying your kids.”</p>

<p class="noindent-squ1">■ R<small>EDMANN</small>, J. An ex-husband appeals from an alimony award as unwarranted and, alternatively, excessive….</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">E<small>NTITLEMENT</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">This prospective husband and wife, in middle age, had each been married before. They executed a pre-marital agreement stipulating separateness of property. We first reject the husband’s argument that the agreement’s waiver by each of every “claim to the property” of the other in case of divorce or death is a waiver of alimony. If public policy were to allow such a waiver, this agreement does not constitute one. Alimony to a divorced wife is not a “claim to the property” of the husband; it is a claim against the husband, limited by his “income.”</p>
<p class="indent">The spouses had other pre-marital discussions in which, at the husband’s instance, they agreed to limit sexual intercourse to about once a week. The husband asserts, as divorce-causing fault, that the wife did not keep this agreement but sought coitus thrice daily. The wife testifies she kept their agreement despite her frustration at not being “permitted” at other times even to touch her husband.</p>
<p class="indent">We reject the view that a pre-marital understanding can repeal or amend the nature of marital obligations as declared by C.C. 119: “The husband and wife owe to each other mutually, fidelity, support and assistance.” Marriage obliges the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page338" class="pagebreak">338</span>spouses to fulfill “the reasonable and normal sex desires of each other.” It is this abiding sexual relationship which characterizes a contract as marriage, rather than, e.g., domestic employer-employee, or landlord-tenant. Persons may indeed agree to live in the same building in some relationship other than marriage. But that is not what our litigants did. They married.</p>
<p class="indent">The law does not authorize contractual modification of the “conjugal association” except “[i]n relation to property,” C.C. 2325. C.C. 2327 prohibits alteration of marriage like that agreed to here which the wife allegedly breached: “Neither can husband and wife derogate by their matrimonial agreement from the rights resulting from the power of the husband over the person of his wife * * *.” Nor—because the rights over the person are largely mutual, C.C. 119 and La. Const. art. 1 sec. 3—can their matrimonial agreement derogate from the power of the wife over the person of her husband.</p>
<p class="indent">The fault here alleged by the husband is not, in law, any fault.</p>
<p class="indent">The husband also finds fault in the wife’s not having sufficiently disciplined her daughter by a previous marriage. There appears to have been a personality conflict between husband and daughter, which resulted in the wife’s awesome decision to send her teen-age daughter out of her home to placate the husband. The daughter was away from home for almost all of the last year and a half of the marriage. The wife’s behavior regarding her daughter was far from fault towards the husband.</p>
<p class="indent">We find no fault which would defeat the ex-wife’s entitlement to alimony.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The husband here asserts breach of a premarital agreement as grounds for reducing or eliminating his alimony obligation upon divorce. Compare <span class="italic">Marriage of Pendleton</span>, p. 309. Why enforce waivers of spousal support but not allow its forfeiture for breach of this agreement?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What if the disappointed spouse wants the contract enforced, not terminated. Could the husband have sued for an injunction or specific performance of this agreement? If he were injured by the wife’s breach, could he recover damages for her failure to keep the bargain? In other legal cultures courts may be more willing to intervene to enforce agreements between spouses and to protect the dependent spouse even on intimate aspects of marriage. For several millennia Jewish law enforced by rabbinic courts has been prepared to enforce the rights of the wife to food, clothing, and sexual relations, as the following news story from the <span class="italic">San Diego Tribune</span> of December 20, 1979, indicates:</p>

<p class="blockquote">TEL AVIV, Israel (UPI)—A rabbinical court has handed down a landmark judgment ordering a 32-year-old man to perform his conjugal duties or pay 36 grains of silver a week until he does so, an Israeli news report said.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Ruling the man “rebellious” against religious law for refusing to have sexual relations with his wife, the three rabbis decreed the countdown start with the handing down of the judgment Tuesday, the Maariv newspaper said.</p>

<p class="blockquote_ind">The court summoned the couple to a hearing based on the wife’s complaint. The woman described her husband’s behavior toward her in every other way as “exemplary.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">But the husband was quoted as having told the rabbis “I am fed up with her” when he was asked to explain why he refused to have relations with his wife.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Rabbinical courts have sole jurisdiction over marriages and divorces in Israel.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. While the traditional marriage contract in our society is at best vague on the nature and scope of the parties’ sexual obligations to one another, it’s pretty clear that extramarital affairs generally violate the deal. What if the parties negotiate a liquidated damages provision to enforce the obligation to “forsake all others”? In <span class="italic">Diosado v. Diosado</span>, 97 Cal. App. 4th 470 (2002), the parties had an express written contract that imposed liquidated damages of $50,000 for each extramarital affair. When the husband cheated nevertheless, the wife not only filed for divorce, but also sued to collect her damages. The California Court of Appeal rejected her damage claim as “contrary to public policy underlying the no-fault provisions for dissolution of marriage. … [<span class="italic">Pendleton</span>, p. 309] provides no authority for enforceability of an agreement between spouses to pay damages in the event one party engages in sexual infidelity.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. In <span class="italic">Favrot</span> the agreement between spouses related to their sexual relations. Suppose a husband and wife agree during marriage that the wife will give the husband all but $100 a week of her take-home pay to apply to household expenses and his clothing and entertainment. If the wife fails to perform, what legal redress is available to the disappointed husband? It is clear that in most states the parties could separate and the husband could demand spousal support with the court’s help, but will a court intervene if the spouses stay together? The answer in our culture is likely to be that courts do not intervene in the agreements of partners to an existing marriage. But the reasons for this judicial reluctance are less clear. It may be, as some opinions suggest, that these arrangements are not contracts, are not supported by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page340" class="pagebreak">340</span> consideration, or are not intended to be enforceable. Or it may be that courts abstain out of concern for the privacy and sanctity of the family, which might be damaged by outside intervention in these delicate matters. Or it may be that courts stay out of these problems because they fear that their capacity to do other important tasks would be hurt if the courts were flooded with squabbles between spouses and between parents and children. Yet questions of domestic support are very important to society. The courts enforce other less important classes of contract: Why should these agreements be outside the realm of enforceable contract?</p>

<p id="sec151" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Maglica v. Maglica</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Court of Appeal, 1998.</p>
<p class="sectionb">66 Cal.App.4th 442, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d 101.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ S<small>ILLS</small>, P<small>RESIDING</small> J<small>USTICE</small>.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. I<small>NTRODUCTION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">This case forces us to confront the legal doctrine known as “quantum meruit” in the context of a case about an unmarried couple who lived together and worked in a business solely owned by one of them. Quantum meruit is a Latin phrase, meaning “as much as he deserves,” and is based on the idea that someone should get paid for beneficial goods or services which he or she bestows on another.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial judge instructed the jury that the reasonable value of the plaintiff’s services was either the value of what it would have cost the defendant to obtain those services from someone else or the “value by which” he had “benefitted [sic] as a result” of those services. The instruction allowed the jury to reach a whopping number in favor of the plaintiff—$84 million—because of the tremendous growth in the value of the business over the years.</p>
<p class="indent">As we explain later, the finding that the couple had no contract in the first place is itself somewhat suspect because certain jury instructions did not accurately convey the law concerning implied-in-fact contracts. However, assuming that there was indeed no contract, the quantum meruit award cannot stand. The legal test for recovery in quantum meruit is not the value of the benefit, but value of the services (assuming, of course, that the services were beneficial to the recipient in the first place). In this case the failure to appreciate that fine distinction meant a big difference. People who work for businesses for a period of years and then walk away with $84 million do so because they have acquired some equity in the business, not because $84 million dollars is the going rate for the services of even the most workaholic manager. In substance, the court was allowing the jury to value the plaintiff’s services as if she had made a sweetheart stock option deal<span class="monospace">C</span>yet such a deal was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page341" class="pagebreak">341</span>precisely what the jury found she did not make. So the $84 million judgment cannot stand.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, plaintiff was hindered in her ability to prove the existence of an implied-in-fact contract by a series of jury instructions which may have misled the jury about certain of the factors which bear on such contracts. The instructions were insufficiently qualified. They told the jury flat out that such facts as a couple’s living together or holding themselves out as husband and wife or sharing a common surname did not mean that they had any agreement to share assets. That is not exactly correct. Such factors can, indeed, when taken together with other facts and in context, show the existence of an implied-in-fact contract. At most the jury instructions should have said that such factors do not by themselves necessarily show an implied-in-fact contract. Accordingly, when the case is retried, the plaintiff will have another chance to prove that she indeed had a deal for a share of equity in the defendant’s business.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II. F<small>ACTS</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The important facts in this case may be briefly stated. Anthony Maglica, a Croatian immigrant, founded his own machine shop business, Mag Instrument, in 1955. He got divorced in 1971 and kept the business. That year he met Claire Halasz, an interior designer. They got on famously, and lived together, holding themselves out as man and wife<span class="monospace">C</span>hence Claire began using the name Claire Maglica<span class="monospace">C</span>but never actually got married. And, while Claire worked side by side building the business, Anthony never agreed<span class="monospace">C</span>or at least the jury found Anthony never agreed<span class="monospace">C</span>to give Claire a share of the business. When the business was incorporated in 1974 all shares went into Anthony’s name. Anthony was the president and Claire was the secretary. They were paid equal salaries from the business after incorporation. In 1978 the business began manufacturing flashlights, and, thanks in part to some great ideas and hard work on Claire’s part (for example, coming out with a purse-sized flashlight in colors), the business boomed. Mag Instrument is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1992 Claire discovered that Anthony was trying to transfer stock to his children but not her, and the couple split up in October. In June 1993 Claire sued Anthony for, among other things, breach of contract, breach of partnership agreement, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and quantum meruit. The case came to trial in the spring of 1994. The jury awarded $84 million for the breach of fiduciary duty and quantum meruit causes of action, finding that $84 million was the reasonable value of Claire’s services.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page342" class="pagebreak">342</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III. D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">A. The Jury’s Finding That There Was No Agreement To Hold Property for One Another Meant There Was No Breach of Fiduciary Duty</span></p>
<p class="indent">Preliminarily we must deal with the problem of fiduciary duty, as it was an alternative basis for the jury’s award. We cannot, however, affirm the judgment on this basis because it is at odds with the jury’s factual finding that Anthony never agreed to give Claire a share of his business. Having found factually that there was no contract, the jury could not legally conclude that Anthony breached a fiduciary duty.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason is that fiduciary duties are either imposed by law or are undertaken by agreement, and neither way of establishing the existence of a fiduciary duty applies here. As to the former, the fact that Claire and Anthony remained unmarried during their relationship is dispositive. California specifically abolished the idea of a “common law marriage” in 1895 and that, if it is not too harsh to say it, was clearly the substance of Claire and Anthony’s relationship. They had a common law marriage. As our Supreme Court said in <span class="italic">Elden</span>, “[f]ormally married couples are granted significant rights and bear important responsibilities toward one another which are not shared by those who cohabit without marriage.” The court noted, in that context, that a variety of statutes impose rights and obligations on married people. One set of such imposed rights and obligations, for example, is Family Code sections 1100 through 1103, which both establish a fiduciary duty between spouses with regard to the management and control of community assets and provide for remedies for a breach of that duty.</p>
<p class="indent">It would be contrary to what our Supreme Court said in <span class="italic">Elden</span> and to the evident policy of the law to promote formal (as distinct from common law) marriage to impose fiduciary duties based on a common law marriage. Indeed, in the context of this case the potential for anomalous results is readily apparent. For example, in family law matters involving dissolution of marriage, punitive damages are not available to remedy breaches of fiduciary duty in the management and control of community property (though there are, of course, other remedies). Punitive damages, however, are sometimes available in other breach of fiduciary duty cases. It is unthinkable, given California’s abolition of common law marriage, that an unmarried, cohabiting partner should have a more powerful remedy than a spouse.</p>
<p class="indent">That leaves contract, and the jury found there was no contract. Claire, despite the closeness of their relationship, never entrusted her property to Anthony; she only rendered services. And without entrustment of property, or an oral agreement to purchase property together, there can be no fiduciary relationship no matter how “confidential” a relationship between an unmarried, cohabiting couple. Indeed, as the <span class="italic">Toney</span> decision points out, it takes clear and convincing evidence of such entrustment or an agreement to buy property together to overcome the presumption of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page343" class="pagebreak">343</span>title<span class="monospace">C</span>and, as previously mentioned, there is no dispute that title to the stock of Mag Instrument was taken solely in Anthony’s name. Here, because the jury affirmatively found there were no such agreements, we need not even address the question of whether the evidence was “clear and convincing.”</p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">B. Quantum Meruit Allows Recovery For the Value of Beneficial Services, Not The Value By Which Someone Benefits From Those Services</span></p>
<p class="indent">The absence of a contract between Claire and Anthony, however, would not preclude her recovery in quantum meruit: As every first year law student knows or should know, recovery in quantum meruit does not require a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The classic formulation concerning the measure of recovery in quantum meruit is found in <span class="italic">Palmer v. Gregg</span>. Justice Mosk, writing for the court, said: “The measure of recovery in quantum meruit is the reasonable value of the services rendered provided they were of direct benefit to the defendant.”</p>
<p class="indent">The underlying idea behind quantum meruit is the law’s distaste for unjust enrichment. If one has received a benefit which one may not justly retain, one should “restore the aggrieved party to his [or her] former position by return of the thing or its equivalent in money.” The idea that one must be benefited by the goods and services bestowed is thus integral to recovery in quantum meruit; hence courts have always required that the plaintiff have bestowed some benefit on the defendant as a prerequisite to recovery.</p>
<p class="indent">But the threshold requirement that there be a benefit from the services can lead to confusion, as it did in the case before us. It is one thing to require that the defendant be benefited by services, it is quite another to measure the reasonable value of those services by the value by which the defendant was “benefited” as a result of them. Contract price and the reasonable value of services rendered are two separate things; sometimes the reasonable value of services exceeds a contract price. And sometimes it does not.</p>
<p class="indent">At root, allowing quantum meruit recovery based on “resulting benefit” of services rather than the reasonable value of beneficial services affords the plaintiff the best of both contractual and quasi-contractual recovery. Resulting benefit is an open-ended standard, which, as we have mentioned earlier, can result in the plaintiff obtaining recovery amounting to de facto ownership in a business all out of reasonable relation to the value of services rendered. After all, a particular service timely rendered can have, as Androcles was once pleasantly surprised to discover in the case of a particular lion, disproportionate value to what it would cost on the open market.</p>
<p class="indent">The facts in this court’s decision in <span class="italic">Passante v. McWilliam</span> illustrate the point nicely. In <span class="italic">Passante</span>, the attorney for a fledgling baseball card company gratuitously arranged a needed loan for $100,000 at a crucial point in the company’s history; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page344" class="pagebreak">344</span> because the loan was made the company survived and a grateful board promised the attorney a three percent equity interest in the company. The company eventually became worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars, resulting in the attorney claiming $33 million for his efforts in arranging but a single loan. This court would later conclude, because of the attorney’s duty to the company as an attorney, that the promise was unenforceable. Interestingly enough, however, the one cause of action the plaintiff in <span class="italic">Passante</span> did not sue on was quantum meruit; while this court opined that the attorney should certainly get paid “something” for his efforts, a $33 million recovery in quantum meruit would have been too much. Had the services been bargained for, the going price would likely have been simply a reasonable finder’s fee.</p>
<p class="indent">The jury instruction given here allows the value of services to depend on their impact on a defendant’s business rather than their reasonable value. True, the services must be of benefit if there is to be any recovery at all; even so, the benefit is not necessarily related to the reasonable value of a particular set of services. Sometimes luck, sometimes the impact of others makes the difference. Some enterprises are successful; others less so. Allowing recovery based on resulting benefit would mean the law imposes an exchange of equity for services, and that can result in a windfall<span class="monospace">C</span>as in the present case<span class="monospace">C</span>or a serious shortfall in others. Equity-for-service compensation packages are extraordinary in the labor market, and always the result of specific bargaining. To impose such a measure of recovery would make a deal for the parties that they did not make themselves. If courts cannot use quantum meruit to change the terms of a contract which the parties did make, it follows that neither can they use quantum meruit to impose a highly generous and extraordinary contract that the parties did not make.</p>
<p class="indent">The cases relied on by Claire for an equity measure of the value of her services are inapposite. [In the omitted portion of the opinion, the court distinguishes several cases cited by plaintiff.] <span class="italic">Watson v. Wood Dimension, Inc.</span> is a little closer, because it allowed a recovery based on a contemplated commission. But it is still off the mark because the commission was specifically agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Wood Dimension</span> a stereo speaker manufacturer hired the friend of a lost customer to wine and dine the customer’s general manager. The parties orally agreed that the friend would be paid three percent commission, but they didn’t agree on how long the commission might extend after the plaintiff was terminated from employment. As this court noted, there is no reason a court may not consider an agreed price when ascertaining the reasonable value of services. Of course, in the case before us, there was no agreement and no agreed price.</p>
<p class="indent">The same applies to the attorney contingent fee cases, of which <span class="italic">Cazares v. Saenz</span> features most prominently in Claire’s argument. As in <span class="italic">Watson</span>, a recovery that what was a share of an enterprise passed muster because the parties had already agreed to such valuation. In <span class="italic">Cazares</span> it was a standard one-third contingency fee which had to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page345" class="pagebreak">345</span>be shared between the attorneys who made that deal with the client and other attorneys with whom they later associated. “Fortunately, when an attorney partially performs on a contingency fee contract,” said the court, “we already have the parties’ agreement as to what was a reasonable fee for the entire case.”</p>
<p class="indent">Telling the jury that it could measure the value of Claire’s services by “[t]he value by which Defendant has benefited as a result of [her] services” was error. It allowed the jury to value Claire’s services as having bought her a de facto ownership interest in a business whose owner never agreed to give her an interest. On remand, that part of the jury instruction must be dropped.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">D. Certain Jury Instructions May Have Misled the Jury Into Finding There Was No Implied Contract When In Fact There Was One</span></p>
<p class="indent">As we have shown, the quantum meruit damage award cannot stand in the wake of the jury’s finding that Claire and Anthony had no agreement to share the equity in Anthony’s business. But the validity of that very finding itself is challenged in Claire’s protective cross-appeal, where she attacks a series of five jury instructions, specially drafted and proffered by Anthony. These instructions are set out in the margin.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_69" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-69" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></sup> We agree with Claire that it was error for the trial court to give three of these five instructions.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_70" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-70" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></sup> The three instructions are so infelicitously worded that they might have misled the jury into concluding that evidence which can indeed support a finding of an implied contract could not.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page346" class="pagebreak">346</div>
<p class="indent">The problem with the three instructions is this: They isolate three uncontested facts about the case: (1) living together, (2) holding out to others as husband and wife, (3) providing services “such as” being a constant companion and confidant<span class="monospace">C</span>and, seriatim, tell the jury that these facts definitely do not mean there was an implied contract. True, none of these facts by themselves and alone necessarily compel the conclusion that there was an implied contract. But that does not mean that these facts cannot, in conjunction with all the facts and circumstances of the case, establish an implied contract. In point of fact, they can.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike the “quasi-contractual” quantum meruit theory which operates without an actual agreement of the parties, an implied-in-fact contract entails an actual contract, but one manifested in conduct rather than expressed in words.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_71" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Alderson v. Alderson</span> (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 450, 461, the court observed that a number of factors, including</p>
<p class="blockquote">- direct testimony of an agreement;</p>
<p class="blockquote">- holding out socially as husband and wife;</p>
<p class="blockquote">- the woman and her children taking the man’s surname;</p>
<p class="blockquote">- pooling of finances to purchase a number of joint rental properties;</p>
<p class="blockquote">- joint decision-making in rental property purchases;</p>
<p class="blockquote">- rendering bookkeeping services for, paying the bills on, and collecting the rents of, those joint rental properties; and</p>
<p class="blockquote">- the nature of title taken in those rental properties</p>
<p class="noindent">could all support a finding there was an implied agreement to share the rental property acquisitions equally.</p>
<p class="indent">We certainly do not say that living together, holding out as husband and wife, and being a companion and confidant, even taken together, are sufficient in and of themselves to show an implied agreement to divide the equity in a business owned by one of the couple. However, <span class="italic">Alderson</span> clearly shows that such facts, together with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page347" class="pagebreak">347</span> others bearing more directly on the business and the way the parties treated the equity and proceeds of the business, can be part of a series of facts which do show such an agreement. The vice of the three instructions here is that they affirmatively suggested that living together, holding out, and companionship could not, as a matter of law, even be part of the support for a finding of an implied agreement. That meant the jury could have completely omitted these facts when considering the other factors which might also have borne on whether there was an implied contract.</p>
<p class="indent">On remand, the three instructions should not be given. The jury should be told, rather, that while the facts that a couple live together, hold themselves out as married, and act as companions and confidants toward each other do not, by themselves, show an implied agreement to share property, those facts, when taken together and in conjunction with other facts bearing more directly on the alleged arrangement to share property, can show an implied agreement to share property.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">D<small>ISPOSITION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The judgment is reversed. The case is remanded for a new trial. At the new trial the jury instructions identified in this opinion as erroneous shall not be given. In the interest of justice both sides will bear their own costs on appeal.</p>
<p id="sec152" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Few would question that two people like the Maglicas, who lived together for over 20 years, shared their lives as well as a surname. They made a home, worked together, had sexual relations, raised children, ate and traveled together, shared friends, felt that they were a couple, and were thought of as such by others. Under these circumstances, is it plausible that the Maglicas impliedly agreed that Claire would be compensated for performing certain domestic duties and personal services by obtaining equity in Tony’s business? Is it more or less plausible that the Maglicas entered into a business partnership agreement? Can one “impliedly” grant an equity interest in a corporation? Or is Claire’s claim really the same as if she were a divorcing dependent spouse rather than a business partner?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Should the court assume that couples who live together for years, hold themselves out to the community as married, and raise children intend marriage-like obligations? If such parties intend such consequences, why don’t they pay the state $23 and get married?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. What will happen in this case upon remand to the trial court? If you were plaintiff’s counsel, what kind of details would you look for to weave into your story at trial? What would the trier of fact need to see and hear in order to come to the conclusion that the Maglicas did enter into an agreement? How would her remedy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page348" class="pagebreak">348</span> be calculated if she proves an implied contract? What remedy would she have if she cannot prove an implied contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Couples cohabiting for companionship or love have widely varying expectations. Some are affianced and in “trial marriages” that the partners expect will ripen into legal marriages, or terminate, within a relatively short period of time. Others may involve older widowed or divorced partners who have already raised children in past legal marriages with others, and seek long term mutual support, but choose not to marry to preserve separate Social Security, pension or medical benefits, or to maintain financial separateness for reasons of inheritance or other family reasons. Others (including many college students) may be in more temporary dating relationships but find it convenient to temporarily share a household to reduce expenses. And some are in committed long-term relationships in which they live together, pool finances, bear and raise children, and participate in community life as a traditional two-parent family but without legally marrying. Most are likely to be uncertain precisely how they feel at any one point in time. Moreover relationships evolve. A couple may begin living together on one set of assumptions but find that over time their relationship evolves into another type altogether. It is safe to suggest that every couple has its ups and downs, sometimes feeling very close and sometimes very distant. How should a court decide what the agreement, implied or expressed, consists of? Should the warm sharing statements of sunny days override other indications of a desire to maintain separateness?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. The incidence of heterosexual couples living together without marriage has exploded over the last 50 years. In 1960 the US Census reported 500,000 such couples. According to the US Census’ Current Population Survey, in 2012, 7.6 million unmarried heterosexual couples (constituting 6.5% of the total adult US population) shared a household. In addition about 500,000 same-sex couples were reported. There is every indication that this trend towards cohabitation without marriage will continue or perhaps even accelerate given demographic trends including the changing ethnic composition of the population and the decline of older cohorts that tend not to form such households. Indeed, married heterosexual couples now constitute less than half of all households in the United States. Few couples, married or not, enter into express contracts that purport to govern the financial aspects of their relationships or their termination. How can contract law better respond to the formation and dissolution of these multifarious personal relationships? Is it capable of doing so?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. If you had asked the Maglicas in 1971, 1981, and 1991 what kind of a deal they had, would you have gotten the same answer? If you had asked Ms. Maglica would you have gotten the same answer that you would have gotten from Mr. Maglica? Which deal is binding, or are they all binding?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page349" class="pagebreak">349</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">7</span>. Much of the pressure in these cases seems to be for an explicit written agreement. Will lovers eschewing marriage write such agreements? If such agreements are drafted, will they be likely to redress gender and other inequalities between the parties, or will they more often aggravate typical male-female imbalance in society? One dilemma associated with encouraging people to solve social problems by contract is that negotiated contracts tend to work to the advantage of the strong, and the product therefore tends to aggravate imbalances in bargaining strength between the parties rather than equalize them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">8</span>. Professor Cynthia Bowman in <span class="italic">Unmarried Couples, Law and Public Policy</span> (Oxford 2010) surveys the legal, historical, sociological, and comparative law landscape relating to non-marital relationships. She notes that the United States has lagged behind such nations as Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in developing legal structures to protect dependent partners in non-marital relationships. She proposes that states adopt “a multifaceted legal regime under which a heterosexual couple initially may choose between marrying or entering into a domestic partnership that extends the rights and obligations of marriage unless they execute a contract between them to avoid these consequences. If they do not do so, after two years or the birth of a child, this quasi-marriage status would be imposed on them unless they specifically opt-out by agreement.” <span class="italic">Id.</span> at 8. Are the reforms Bowman proposes necessary? Are they sufficient? Why not protect all dependent spouses, married and unmarried, without regard to any phony agreements they get pushed into signing? That is, deal with the substantive inequality that permeates the structure of our society by changing the rules!</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">9</span>. Few laws or decisions define the content of the marital relation beyond general statements about mutual obligations of respect, fidelity, and support. Each couple over time gives content to its own marriage, and, as long as the couple remains joined, the law does not attempt to define its union. There has been increasing interest in recent years in agreements between spouses that define their rights and duties toward each other. The subject matter of these agreements is likely to include the allocation of responsibility for household tasks and child-raising, matters of primary concern to society and its continuity. Should courts entertain suits to enforce such agreements? Suppose a husband agrees to do his share of the housework and child-care chores, neglects his duties, and spends weekends in front of the TV with six-packs of beer. How should a court react to a wife’s contract claim for damages or specific performance?</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">Consider the legal aspects of the contracts under which you (or your employer) will be compensated for your professional services after you graduate. Lawyer retention agreements are a special subset of the more general category of personal service contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">Lawyers’ retention agreements are subject to special rules and are naturally of special interest to law students. Given the nature of legal services, performance is often difficult to define precisely in terms of quantity and quality. As in other contexts, contract doctrine adjusts in light of such circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">The major theme of this section is the extent to which relationships between attorneys and clients should be a matter of contract. How much freedom should society recognize for lawyers and clients to define the terms of their relationship, the price of the attorney’s services, the scope of employment, and other definitions of their mutual obligations? There are many reasons to constrict the range of contract terms for attorney employment. Lawyers are professionals, and the obligations we bear our clients are fixed by traditional professional standards. Ethical rules and statutes reinforce these traditions and further limit lawyers’ freedom to agree to different terms.</p>
<p class="indent">Most clients and most attorneys do not bargain on an equal footing: Contracts are the lawyer’s turf. Few clients come to lawyers before a crisis situation has arisen. The average American consults a lawyer only once or twice in a lifetime. Sometimes the first interview is in a jail holding cell. Even when the meeting is not under such extreme constraints, it commonly occurs because the client’s spouse has just left home and cleaned out the bank accounts on the way; a family member has died, and tangled legal and financial affairs must be attended to in the face of overwhelming grief; or some other trauma has brought home to the client the unwelcome awareness that a lawyer is needed. In those situations the client may be forced to negotiate terms of retention with the lawyer from a position of gross disadvantage.</p>

<p class="indent">Paula Harding was four years out of law school. Six months ago she had left Gibson, Austin &amp; Cromwell LLP to hang out her shingle as a labor and employment lawyer in California. Those early months in solo law practice were hard, although referrals from her old firm paid the rent while Paula worked to build her practice.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page351" class="pagebreak">351</div>
<p class="indent">Ted Olsen was a college classmate and had been co-president with Paula of the Student Council during their senior year. While Paula had been in law school and slaving at Gibson, Austin &amp; Cromwell, back on the East Coast Ted became the hottest young man in e-commerce. He had an uncanny ability to drive traffic to websites through what he called an “integrated packaging approach.” The technique required a programmer’s skills, but also finesse and imagination in developing a unique approach for each application.</p>
<p class="indent">Ted texted Paula to say he was coming to California and wanted to have lunch. Over lunch Ted explained that he was talking to Amalgamated Consolidated Enterprises (ACE), a giant conglomerate in just about every kind of business. ACE saw the potential in Ted’s integrated packaging approach not only for its own websites, but also for those of its many business customers. ACE wanted Ted to head up this new operation in a newly formed ACE subsidiary.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to Ted and Paula’s lunch, ACE’s president had offered Ted a three-year contract which he said would contain “the works” in the way of fringe benefits, with a total potential value, including stock options and bonuses, of more than $5,000,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Paula and Ted talked long into the afternoon, examining all the angles of Ted’s position, the new business, the ACE contract, Ted’s place in the organization, the effect of the move on his existing business relationships, and the changes it implied for his tax and estate planning. Ted asked Paula to be his lawyer “for the whole situation” and Paula of course was very excited to land her first major client on her own. Ted agreed to send Paula a retainer and pay for Paula’s services on an hourly basis. Later that afternoon Paula prepared the following letter which she emailed to Ted:</p>
<p class="center">November 18, 2015</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Dear Ted:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">You have asked me to represent you in the matter of your negotiations for an employment contract with Amalgamated Consolidated Enterprises. The scope of the representation will include negotiations with the prospective employer (if you so desire), preparation and review of the contract and any collateral agreements that may be required, and an examination of the retirement and other fringe benefits.</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">You will pay me an initial fee of $5,000 and at the conclusion of the matter I will bill you on the basis of services actually performed, crediting you with the $5,000 down <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page352" class="pagebreak">352</span>payment. I will bill you from time to time for out-of-pocket disbursements for which you will be responsible.</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">If the above meets with your understanding, please sign on the copy of this letter in the space indicated below, return it to me with the initial fee, and this shall constitute the agreement between us.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="imagel"><img src="./384.jpg" alt="images" /></p>
<p class="blockquotess"><span class="vlad">Paula Harding</span></p>
<p class="blockquotes">Accepted and Agreed:<br />__________________<br />Ted Olsen</p>
<p class="indent">When Ted got back to his office the next day he opened up the attachment, raised an eyebrow at the $5,000 “initial fee,” shrugged, printed it out, signed it, and returned it to Paula with his check for $5,000.</p>
<p id="sec155" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent">What ambiguities exist in Paula’s retainer letter? What would you change? What provisions are missing?</p>
<h4 id="sec156" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">B.    T<small>HE</small> A<small>TTORNEY</small>’<small>S</small> R<small>ETAINER</small> A<small>GREEMENT</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">Retainer agreements often are in the form of an accepted or acknowledged letter, although some types of legal employment and fees, for example those of bankruptcy counsel whose fees are paid from the estate, must follow a prescribed form and be approved by the court. Beyond reciting that the attorney has been retained, the retainer letter may be extremely sketchy and can be a fertile source of dispute. The scope of the work to be done often is vaguely described and provides an inadequate standard against which performance can be measured. Particularly when the fee is either fixed or contingent on recovery, questions may arise as to just how much the lawyer is expected to do to earn the fee. It is important for the lawyer to make all appropriate disclosures and seek waivers of any conflicts of interest at the very beginning of the lawyer-client relationship, and a good retainer letter will accomplish those objectives as well as furnishing a written contractual basis for the collection of the attorney’s fee and expenses. When lawyers practice in large firms, the process of client intake, including conflict checks, negotiating waivers, making disclosures, defining the proper scope of work, and providing adequate assurance of payment can be involved and complex processes involving intake committee approvals and compliance with procedures mandated by the firm and its malpractice <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page353" class="pagebreak">353</span>carrier to limit liability and avoid future disputes. Client intake procedures in such firms may also be heavily influenced by the firm’s internal compensation practices including the allocation of “credit” to individual for the origination and management of cases and clients.</p>
<p class="indent">At the other extreme, in a substantial number of situations involving lawyers practicing in less bureaucratic settings, the lawyer may have no written agreement with the client. This practice has come under increasing attack from critics both within and outside the legal profession. Many states now require a written agreement when the lawyer is working for a contingent fee and, as the California statutes below indicate, the requirement of a written agreement is becoming more general.</p>

<p class="indent">The retainer agreement serves several distinct functions: It establishes (a) the authority of the lawyer to act as agent and attorney of the client; (b) the scope of the work to be done; (c) the basis for compensation; (d) disclosure and consent to certain types of conflicting interests or concurrent representations that would otherwise violate the rules of professional responsibility; and (e) other terms governing the relationship, ranging from termination to dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to a license from the state, a lawyer needs authority from the client to act on the client’s behalf. Admission to the bar does not authorize lawyers to intervene officiously in the affairs of others. The source of this authority is the mandate of the client, which establishes a relationship between the lawyer as agent and the client as principal. In some modern situations it may be difficult to tell whether the client or the lawyer is really in charge, particularly when the attorney is assigned by a court or public agency to represent the client or when the client is a large anonymous class which the lawyer has created by the pleader’s sleight of hand. Whatever the practical problems may be, there is no conceptual difficulty here. The attorney’s authority to act is created and defined by the client’s agreement to retain the lawyer, subject to limitations imposed by law.</p>
<p class="indent">Lawyer’s fees typically are set on one of three bases:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) <span class="italic">Fixed Fee:</span> Under this approach, a set price is placed on a given service: $200 to draft a deed; $20,000 to brief and argue an appeal; $2,500 to examine a complex set of documents. In many jurisdictions minimum or suggested fee schedules for various services used to be established by bar associations or court rule. In 1976 the Supreme Court of the United States held in <span class="italic">Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar</span> that bar fee schedules violate the antitrust laws, at least when they are mandatory and enforced against the lawyer. For some special kinds of service, such as worker’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page356" class="pagebreak">356</span>compensation, social security or veterans’ benefits proceedings before administrative agencies, the lawyer’s fee may be regulated by state or federal statute.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) <span class="italic">Time Charges:</span> For most complex legal matters, it is difficult when the lawyer is retained to estimate how much effort may be required. From the lawyer’s point of view the most important factor in setting the fee usually is the time to be invested in the job and the extent to which it will tie up office resources. The retainer agreement, therefore, is likely to state that services will be billed on the basis of time spent at agreed hourly rates plus reimbursement of expenses.</p>
<p class="indent">Paula Harding’s letter to Ted Olsen is an example of such an agreement, but note that, like many agreements you will encounter in actual practice, it gives no clear idea of how much the client will be charged for any given service, nor does it clearly indicate what the “initial fee” of $5,000 covers. For example, if ACE terminates discussions with Ted two days after he retains Paula and before she does anything on his behalf, does she get to keep the $5,000? Is it a minimum fee or a form of security deposit?</p>
<p class="indent">(c) <span class="italic">Contingent Fees:</span> Sometimes, particularly when lawyers represent plaintiffs suing for damages, legal fees may be calculated as a percentage of the amount recovered. This may be advantageous from the client’s viewpoint since the fee, if any, is dependent on the result obtained and the benefit gained by the client. If there is no recovery, the lawyer receives nothing. In any event, the client need not pay for the services until there is a recovery, which is an important benefit to a client who lacks funds to retain counsel otherwise. Contingent fee arrangements may be subject to abuse, however, and a number of jurisdictions seek to control the percentage fee the lawyer may receive and otherwise supervise the relationship. Few nations outside the United States permit such arrangements, and in this country contingent fees are permissible only in some situations. In particular, contingent fees are generally useful only when the lawyer’s efforts will produce a fund of money out of which the fee will be paid; although, certain institutional clients and their lawyers are increasingly experimenting with contingent fees based on successful defense of monetary claims. Contingent fees are inappropriate when a lawyer represents a defendant in a suit seeking nonmonetary relief (at least in the absence of a fee-shifting statute like the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. § 504; 28 U.S.C. § 2412) and are generally considered unethical in divorce or criminal cases.</p>
<p class="indent">The bases for computing lawyers’ charges reflects at least five different views of lawyers’ work and relationship to the client and society.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The lawyer as the client’s aristocratic friend in court.</span> The Anglo-American legal profession once sharply distinguished courtroom lawyers from office counselors. This bifurcation is still present in the profession in England, which has two separate kinds of lawyers, barristers and solicitors. Time has diluted, but not eliminated, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page357" class="pagebreak">357</span>kinds of distinctions between barristers, who are courtroom advocates, and solicitors, who are office counselors and drafters.</p>
<p class="indent">The barrister started as a gentleman friend of the client in Royal Court. Class and connections, blended artistically with a smooth and persuasive articulateness rather than rigorous education, were required for entry into the profession. Barristers were called to the bar after having attended a set number of dinner sessions at the Inns of Court. Direct pedagogy was diluted with food, fellowship, and good claret. The barrister gives counsel to the client and presents the client’s case to the Court, but the gentleman barrister does not work for the client. It remains unethical in England for the barrister to have direct financial dealings with the client. The client must be introduced to the barrister by a solicitor, and dealings between them are mediated by the solicitor. The barrister’s fee started as a gratuity from the solicitor, and to this day it is not negotiated personally by the barrister, but by a clerk who handles the barrister’s office administration. The barrister has no contractual claim for the fee enforceable against the client. The class assumptions underlying this structure do not fit very well in contemporary American life, but the continuity of these practices in the United Kingdom testifies to the viability of structures other than contract to organize professional relationships.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The lawyer as an artisan.</span> Not all providers of legal services have an aristocratic professional origin. Solicitors start out as skilled servants of aristocrats. One part of this branch of the profession grew out of estate agents who managed the property and personal business affairs of the wealthy, while their employers devoted their time to military, political, ecclesiastical, and other cultural pursuits. These solicitors would draft written instruments dealing with property. Solicitors learned their professions as articled clerks, apprenticed early in their teens for lengthy on-the-job training, culminating in lectures and an examination at a professional institute. As Gilbert and Sullivan teach us, as the young lawyer moved up from office boy to junior clerk, “I served the writs with a smile so bland, and I copied all the letters in a big round hand.” Viewed this way, solicitors were artisans who had a special set of skills to sell. They produced documents and agreements, just as shoemakers produced shoes. This view of their function would suggest compensation on a fixed-fee basis for each of their units of production. While these products traditionally were hand-crafted by lawyer-artisans individually for each client, new technologies and market structures have commoditized many of these sorts of legal services. Either through computer software or outsourcing of legal services, an increasing share of what used to be the work of highly skilled individual lawyers can be produced and marketed more efficiently on a mass basis. Certainly this is the case in many areas of consumer law. But even businesses are increasingly relying on technology and outsourcing rather than traditional law firms in meeting their routine legal needs. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page358" class="pagebreak">358</span>Richard Susskind provocatively predicts that technology and outsourcing will radically reshape the market for legal services in the 21st century into a very small market for extremely specialized services provided on a traditional basis, and a much larger market in which a relatively small number of lawyers do not provide directly, but rather organize the provision of, routine services for almost all clients by less highly skilled persons (perhaps in less developed countries) working at lower wages, and, increasingly, computers. R<small>ICHARD</small> S<small>USSKIND</small>, T<small>HE</small> E<small>ND OF</small> L<small>AWYERS</small>? (Oxford 2008).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The lawyer as wage worker.</span> There is another way of looking at solicitors serving their powerful clients. Such relationships often were long-standing and persisted for generations as a firm of solicitors grew from youth to age serving a landed family’s interests. These solicitors might be seen as a kind of high status servant, continually employed to advance the family’s interests, rather than as an artisan selling individual scraps of paper. As such, their compensation would be measured by a wage, salary, or other periodic retainer.</p>
<p class="indent">In America today, a growing number of lawyers work on a salary basis for a single client. This reflects the increase in large organizations that have created their own legal departments to service their needs full-time instead of hiring outside lawyers. Corporations, government agencies, universities all are likely to have salaried employees working as house counsel this way. In addition, law practice, which two generations ago was dominated by single practitioners and office sharing lawyers working together, has now become dominated by large law firms that may employ thousands of attorneys. The senior members of the firm are partners and share in the profits of their activities, but most of the lawyers working for the firm will be associates, or salaried workers, who do not directly charge the client for their services. Instead, the firm charges the client and pays the associate a salary that is independent of the fees charged to clients. Indeed many of the partners of such a firm may have very limited management responsibility and may function as highlycompensated employees with a profit-sharing arrangement rather than as owners of the firm.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The lawyer as the client’s co-venturer.</span> In the American experience the lawyer may play a broader role in the client’s affairs than just a courtroom advocate or skilled drafter. Lawyers advise clients on the wisdom and potential tax, business and legal consequences of contemplated ventures and negotiate the terms of the deal. Sometimes their fees may not be in cash or based on time worked or documents produced, but in the form of an interest in the enterprise, a piece of the action. Lawyers are most commonly their client’s co-venturers in another way, for as was mentioned, our system permits contingent fees to enhance access to legal services for clients with a valuable claim but no cash for lawyers’ fees.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page359" class="pagebreak">359</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The lawyer as a public utility.</span> If lawyers are providers of a necessary public service, then the prices and terms of their service may be fixed by law or regulation. Indeed, in most communities the organized bar claims just such a function to regulate and discipline members. In addition, there has been growing recognition that in many common situations the availability of legal services is a right of the client. The source of this right may be constitutional, for example, when a person charged with a serious crime claims the right of assistance of counsel, or it may be part of a governmental program to provide legal services to all persons, as is the case of some legal aid programs organized by the state and federal governments. The consequences of this public utility view are clear: the lawyer’s tie to the client is based on the contract to only a very limited degree.</p>

<p class="indent">Consider this <span class="italic">New York Law Journal</span> report concerning a dispute over legal fees incurred by the family of a victim of the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Laura Balemian, whose husband Edward J. Mardovich died in the World Trade Center, received one of the largest awards paid out by the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund: $6.7 million.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">But she in turn paid out what is almost certainly the highest legal fee. While the vast majority of victims were represented before the fund pro bono or for a nominal fee, Balemian paid her lawyer, Thomas J. Troiano, a one-third contingent fee, or over $2 million.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The propriety of Troiano’s fee is now before the courts. A guardian appointed by the Suffolk County Surrogate’s Court in New York, where Mardovich’s estate is in probate, last year challenged the fee as excessive and not in the best interests of Balemian’s four children. Troiano responded earlier this year by suing Balemian in Manhattan federal court for declaratory judgment approving his fees.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page361" class="pagebreak">361</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The situation is an uncomfortable one for trial lawyers’ groups, who normally support contingent fee arrangements but went to extraordinary lengths to avoid being seen as profiting from the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master who oversaw the fund’s distribution of some $7 billion, submitted an April 21 affidavit in the federal case in which he called Troiano’s fee “shocking and unconscionable” in light of the fund’s purpose and its guidelines recommending attorney fees be kept under 5 percent.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“In my experience of presiding over the processing and award determinations of some 7,400 claims, of conducting hundreds of individual hearings within the Program, and of meeting with thousands of families and victims in large and small groups, I have never learned of a legal fee even approaching the fee sought in this case,” Feinberg wrote.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">But Troiano, who declined to be interviewed for this article, said in court documents responding to Feinberg’s affidavit that Balemian’s large award, which was increased from an initial presumptive award of $1.1 million, justified the contingent fee.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“Fund statistics show that lesser attorneys—or perhaps those who were marginally incentivized by the meager 5 percent fee recommended by the Special Master—achieved results that pale in comparison to the award [Troiano] obtained for [Balemian],” the lawyer said.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“If anything is ‘shocking and unconscionable’ it is that, due to unabashed greed, Defendant now (more than two years after having ratified the Retainer Agreement) seeks disgorgement of fees earned by Plaintiff from the hard work, at significant personal sacrifice, he rendered for the benefit of Defendant and her children.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">At the time of his death, Mardovich was the 42-year-old president of Euro Brokers, an interdealer brokerage that had offices on the 84th floor of the World Trade Center’s South Tower. The firm lost 61 of its 65 employees in the terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">According to his federal complaint, Troiano, 62, had never represented Mardovich or his wife before but was a longtime friend and neighbor in their North Shore Long Island community. He claims that, in the days after Sept. 11, a “frightened and confused” Balemian reached out to him and asked him to assist her with the legal issues arising from the death of her husband, who left no will.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“She told him that he was the only person she trusted to handle such matters,” Troiano’s complaint states. “She told him that Edward Mardovich had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page362" class="pagebreak">362</span>told her that if anything ever happened to him, she should turn to Tom Troiano for help.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Troiano claims he took charge of all of the family’s legal affairs, including locating and consolidating money in Mardovich’s various accounts, finding a suitable financial planner and resolving the deceased’s partnership interest in several racehorses.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">For essentially becoming the Mardovich family lawyer, Troiano said he never asked for nor received any payment. But he did have Balemian sign a retainer agreement on Oct. 15, 2001. (She was Ms. Mardovich at the time. She married Robert Balemian in April 2002).</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The agreement states the one-third fee will be contingent on a recovery in possible lawsuits against, among others, the airlines, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban regime of Afghanistan, New York City as well as “any other legal, governmental, quasi-governmental or non-profit agency responsible for the September 11, 2001 crash or any recoverable claims resulting after the September 11, 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Congress created the compensation fund on Sept. 22, 2001, as part of the Air Transportation Safety and Systems Stabilization Act. Feinberg was appointed special master in November 2001, and the fund’s rules were initially published in December of that year. In return for receiving compensation from the fund, claimants waived their rights to sue the airlines. Over 97 percent of affected families ultimately participated in the fund.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Troiano claims he explored all possible avenues of recovery for Balemian, including tort litigation. He said he spent one year monitoring the fund’s activities and talked regularly to other participating lawyers in order to figure out how to maximize an award from the fund. He retained Conrad Berenson, a Baruch College economist, to draft a report on Mardovich’s future earning potential.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">This report was submitted to the fund with other records on March 14, 2003. Three months later, Balemian was notified she would receive a presumptive award of $1,087,420, based on estimated losses of $3,931,497 minus insurance offsets $2,844,256. She was given the option of requesting a hearing.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Troiano claims he urged Balemian to contest the award, which she did. He represented her at an August 13, 2003, hearing, calling as witnesses Berenson and the chief financial officer of Euro Brokers.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">On Sept. 30, 2003, Balemian was notified that her final award would be $6,656,151, based on estimated losses of $9,500,408 minus insurance offsets. Troiano was paid his fee in January 2004.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page363" class="pagebreak">363</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In his court papers, Troiano called the final award an “astounding” result and stressed his skill and legal acumen. “Rather than greedily seeking disgorgement from Troiano,” one of his filings states, “[Balemian] ought to be happily praising his extraordinary efforts, which yielded a lifetime of security for [her] and her children.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Balemian’s lawyer, Kevin P. Simmons of Syosset, N.Y.’s Simmons, Jannace &amp; Stagg, said his client was not claiming that Troiano did not do a good job.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“He obviously did,” said Simmons. “The question is how much is that worth.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Despite the 5 percent guideline, the fund’s rules defer to state law with regard to attorney’s fees. But in an interview with the New York Law Journal last week, Feinberg challenged the notion that skillful advocacy played a role in the size of victims’ awards.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“I find it difficult to understand how any lawyer can request a 30 percent fee for simply filing a claim with the 9/11 fund,” he said. “It’s a nonadversarial process where the special master was working with families and family lawyers to find a way to legitimately give them this money.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Hearings that led to higher awards were a routine part of the process, said Feinberg. In his affidavit, he noted that 68 percent of the claims involving deaths had a hearing at which evidence was presented.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Steven Lubet, a legal ethics professor at Northwestern University School of Law, said courts have been divided on what factors to consider in weighing the appropriateness of contingent-fee arrangements. He said some courts had taken a strict contract approach, going with the clear language of the retainer agreement.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">But Lubet said other courts have taken the view that “contingent fees need to be contingent on something.” These courts, he said, generally look at whether the lawyer taking the case is running a risk of nonrecovery.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Simmons said that, given the nature of the fund, Troiano had run no risk at all. “There was absolutely no chance that it would be zero,” said Simmons.</p>

<p class="indent">Broglio is arrested for extortion and contacts Walton to represent him. Walton agrees to represent Broglio for a non-refundable fixed fee of $15,000. Is this a reasonable fee? Only about half of all felony arrests result in the filing of a criminal complaint. What if Walton calls the district attorney to discuss the case and learns he has already decided to drop the charges against Broglio? On the other hand, what if Broglio is charged with a felony and demands a jury trial that consumes six months of Walton’s time even before the appeals that will carry the case all the way to the Supreme Court in the hopes of obtaining reversal and yet another jury trial? What if Walton is known as the best criminal defense lawyer in the area? Could Broglio have shopped around for a better deal? What were his real choices as he sat in the holding cell? What if Broglio fires Walton shortly after agreeing to the $15,000 retainer, and Walton therefore performs no services on Broglio’s behalf? Compare <span class="italic">Walton v.

<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-54" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_54" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a>.  The right to spousal support is statutory. Family Code section 4330, subdivision (a), provides: “In a judgment of dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties, the court may order a party to pay for the support of the other party an amount, for a period of time, that the court determines is just and reasonable, based on the standard of living established during the marriage, taking into consideration the circumstances as provided in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 4320).”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-55" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_55" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>.  The order explained: “Assuming arguendo that the validity and enforceability of the waiver of spousal support provision of the parties’ prenuptial agreement can be tested in a motion to strike, the court denied this motion on the ground that a waiver of spousal support in a premarital agreement is void and unenforceable as against California public policy. The court is persuaded that the legislative history of the statute dealing with the permissible subjects of premarital agreements indicated that the Legislature intended to omit a provision in the California version of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (UPAA) that allowed for a premarital waiver of spousal support.</p>
<p class="fn_txt1">“The court is further persuaded that the pre-UPAA cases that hold that premarital agreements that diminish or waive a party’s obligation to pay spousal support to the other party to the marriage are unenforceable as against public policy and would continue to be so held after the passage of the UPAA. At least one purpose of a policy that a spousal support waiver will be unenforceable in this state is to protect the state, not just a party to the marriage. A person’s financial circumstances can change markedly from those found just prior to that person’s marriage. A valid premarital spousal support waiver could produce spouses who at the time of their marriage have assets and earning capacity to support themselves without spousal support, but by the time of the dissolution of their marriages may be unable to support themselves and in need of financial support. The state has an interest in having such needy spouses supported by their spouses if possible. Just as the state has a serious fiscal interest in not paying for support of children if there is a parent with the capacity to support that parent’s children, the state has a fiscal interest in seeing that it not be forced to support needy former spouses if the non-needy former spouse is able to contribute to the support of the needy former spouse and if ordering the payment of such support is warranted, pursuant to the principles of Family Code § 4320. Thus the same principles and policies that underlie the public policy against permitting a binding waiver of child support would apply to premarital waivers of spousal support.”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-56" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_56" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>.  Section 1615:</p>
<p class="fn_list">(a) A premarital agreement is not enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves either of the following:</p>
<p class="fn_list1">(1) That party did not execute the agreement voluntarily.</p>
<p class="fn_list1">(2) The agreement was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution of the agreement, all of the following applied to that party:</p>
<p class="fn_list2">(A) That party was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party.</p>
<p class="fn_list2">(B) That party did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party beyond the disclosure provided.</p>
<p class="fn_list2">(C) That party did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of the property or financial obligations of the other party.</p>
<p class="fn_list">(b) An issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a matter of law.”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-57" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_57" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  <span class="italic">Dawley</span> also observed that use of the term “facilitate” in past cases describing unenforceable premarital agreements was misleading, since any such agreement could be said to facilitate dissolution by making a dissolution proceeding shorter and less expensive. Speaking in the context of a property agreement, we said that “public policy does not render property agreements unenforceable merely because such agreements simplify the division of marital property: it is only when the agreement encourages or promotes dissolution that it offends the public policy to foster and protect marriage.”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-58" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_58" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a>.  Candace asks the court to take judicial notice of copies of: (1) a letter dated August 14, 1985, to Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly, from the Family Law Section of the State Bar of California opposing the inclusion in Senate Bill 1143 of authorization for premarital waivers of spousal support; (2) a June 6, 1985, letter to the same effect to Senator Robert Beverly; (3) various sections of the New Jersey version of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act; and (4) former section 159 of the Civil Code, as originally enacted in 1872 and repealed in 1969.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">The first two items, although bearing a Legislative Intent Service stamp, are not certified copies and it is not apparent that either was considered by the Legislature when Senate Bill 1143 was considered. There is no basis for an assumption that such letters reflect legislative intent. Judicial notice may be taken of the law of another state. However, that law was not enacted until 1988 and thus is not relevant to legislative intent in this state. We therefore deny the request for judicial notice.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">The position of the Women Lawyers’ Association of Los Angeles was made clear to the Legislature in the subcommittee report discussed herein which quoted parts of it. That report listed the Family Law Section of the State Bar as a supporter of Senate Bill 1143, a position that later changed, as reflected in the referenced letter. The request for judicial notice of former section 159 of the Civil Code is granted.</p>

<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-61" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_61" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a>.  Section 3 of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act provides: “(a) Parties to a premarital agreement may contract with respect to: (1) the rights and obligations of each of the parties in any of the property of either or both of them whenever and wherever acquired or located; (2) the right to buy, sell, use, transfer, exchange, abandon, lease, consume, expend, assign, create a security interest in, mortgage, encumber, dispose of, or otherwise manage and control property; (3) the disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event; <span class="italic">(4) the modification or elimination of spousal support;</span> (5) the making of a will, trust, or other arrangement to carry out the provisions of the agreement; (6) the ownership rights in and disposition of the death benefit from a life insurance policy; (7) the choice of law governing the construction of the agreement; and (8) any other matter, including their personal rights and obligations, not in violation of public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.

The main issue in <span class="italic">Bonds</span> is whether one spouse voluntarily entered into the premarital agreement, an issue not presented here. Also, the focus of the dispute in <span class="italic">Bonds</span> appears to be the premarital waiver of community property rights, not spousal support. This distinction is crucial because the Legislature, when it enacted the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, deliberately omitted the provision authorizing spousal support waivers while approving and enacting the provision authorizing waivers of community property rights.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">The Legislature’s decision to permit waiver of community property rights, but not spousal support, may be explained on policy grounds. A spouse who has waived community property rights, but not spousal support, retains effective protection against a sudden, drastic, and inequitable loss of income resulting from dissolution of marriage, and may have recourse either to former community property or to separate property to enforce a spousal support order (Fam. Code, § 4338). By contrast, a spouse who has lost the right to spousal support may well have no recourse except public assistance. Thus, the inequities that may result from premarital spousal support waivers are much graver than those that may result from a premarital waiver of community property rights.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-64" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_64" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>.  Family Code section 4320 provides: “In ordering spousal support under this part, the court shall consider all of the following circumstances: (a) The extent to which the earning capacity of each party is sufficient to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage, taking into account all of the following: (1) The marketable skills of the supported party; the job market for those skills; the time and expenses required for the supported party to acquire the appropriate education or training to develop those skills; and the possible need for retraining or education to acquire other, more marketable skills or employment. (2) The extent to which the supported party’s present or future earning capacity is impaired by periods of unemployment that were incurred during the marriage to permit the supported party to devote time to domestic duties. (b) The extent to which the supported party contributed to the attainment of an education, training, a career position, or a license by the supporting party. (c) The ability to pay of the supporting party, taking into account the supporting party’s earning capacity, earned and unearned income, assets, and standard of living. (d) The needs of each party based on the standard of living established during the marriage. (e) The obligations and assets, including the separate property, of each party. (f) The duration of the marriage. (g) The ability of the supported party to engage in gainful employment without unduly interfering with the interests of dependent children in the custody of the party. (h) The age and health of the parties …. (i) The immediate and specific tax consequences to each party. (j) The balance of the hardships to each party. (k) The goal that the supported party shall be self-supporting within a reasonable period of time…. [A] ‘reasonable period of time’ for purposes of this section generally shall be one-half the length of the marriage. However, nothing in this section is intended to limit the court’s discretion to order support for a greater or lesser length of time, based on any of the other factors listed in this section … and the circumstances of the parties. (<span class="italic">l</span>) Any other factors the court determines are just and equitable.” Section 4320 applies to spousal support upon legal separation or dissolution of the marriage.</p>

We therefore describe the facts as asserted in respondents’ second amended complaint. They are, of course, no more than allegations.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-66" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_66" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>.  While the Government neither confirms nor denies that respondents are part of any “PL-110” program, the parties agree this reference is to a provision enacted [as part of the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949]. This provision allows a limited number of aliens and members of their immediate families per year to be admitted to the United States for permanent residence, regardless of their admissibility under the immigration laws, upon a determination by the Director of the CIA, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Immigration that admission of the particular alien “is in the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance of the national intelligence mission.” § 403h. However, nothing in this statute, nor anything in the redacted CIA regulations and related materials respondents cite, represents an enforceable legal commitment by the CIA to provide support to spies that may be admitted into the United States under § 403h.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-67" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_67" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>.  Respondents document their alleged series of contacts with the CIA. For instance, respondents allegedly received a letter from the CIA in June 1997, expressing regret that the agency no longer had funds available to provide assistance. Later, respondents claim they were told the agency determined “the benefits previously provided were adequate for the services rendered.” Although the CIA apparently did not disclose to respondents the agency’s appeals process, respondents were permitted to appeal the initial determination both to the Director of the CIA and to a panel of former agency officials called the Helms Panel; both appeals were denied.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-68" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_68" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  The Court of Appeals apparently believed that the plaintiff’s relationship with the CIA <span class="italic">was</span> secret in <span class="italic">Webster,</span> just as in this case. It is true that the plaintiff in <span class="italic">Webster</span> proceeded under a pseudonym because “his status as a CIA employee cannot be publicly acknowledged.” Brief for United States in <span class="italic">Webster v. Doe</span>. But the fact that the plaintiff in <span class="italic">Webster</span> kept his <span class="italic">identity</span> secret did not mean that the employment <span class="italic">relationship</span> between him and the CIA was not known and admitted by the CIA.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-69" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_69" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a>.  Here are the five:</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">1. NO CONTRACT RESULTS FROM PARTIES HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS HUSBAND AND WIFE. You cannot find an agreement to share property or form a partnership from the fact that the parties held themselves out as husband and wife. The fact that unmarried persons live together as husband and wife and share a surname does not mean that they have any agreement to share earnings or assets.</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">2. NO IMPLIED CONTRACT FROM LIVING TOGETHER. You cannot find an implied contract to share property or form a partnership simply from the fact that the parties lived together[.]</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">3. CREATION OF AN IMPLIED CONTRACT…. The fact the parties are living together does not change any of the requirements for finding an express or implied contract between the parties.</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">4. COMPANIONSHIP DOES NOT CONSTITUTE CONSIDERATION. Providing services such as a constant companion and confidant does not constitute the consideration required by law to support a contract to share property, does not support any right of recovery and such services are not otherwise compensable.</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">5. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY LEGAL MARRIAGE. In California, there are various obligations imposed upon parties who become legally and formally married. These obligations do not arise under the law merely by living together without a formal and legal marriage.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-70" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_70" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a>.  The third and fifth instructions in footnote 11 are simple truisms.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-71" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/15_chapter04.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a>.  Because an implied in fact contract can be found where there is no expression of agreement in words, the line between an implied in fact contract and recovery in quantum meruit—where there may be no actual agreement at all—is fuzzy indeed. We will not attempt, in dicta, to clear up that fuzziness here. Suffice to say that because quantum meruit is a theory which implies a promise to pay for services as a matter of law for reasons of justice, while implied in fact contracts are predicated on actual agreements, albeit not ones expressed in words, recovery in quantum meruit is necessarily a different theory than recovery on an implied in fact contract. Neither do we address the quantum of proof necessary to support recovery on a quantum meruit theory or attempt to divine the dividing line between services which may be so gratuitously volunteered under circumstances in which there can be no reasonable expectation of payment and services which do qualify for recovery in quantum meruit. These matters have not been briefed and may be left for another day.</p>
