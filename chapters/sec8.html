<p class="indent">In earlier Chapters we considered two central theoretical questions: what makes a promise a contract, and when is a contract formed. In practice, however, formation and enforceability issues arise rarely, and, when they do it is almost always retrospectively, when a party resisting enforcement of what both sides almost certainly considered a contract now claims that the rules of consideration or offer and acceptance were not satisfied. In other words, enforceability and formation issues are most likely to be raised by a lawyer trying to get his client out of a contract on technical grounds, not by parties to an agreement in the course of trying to work their way through the contract to performance.</p>
<p class="indent">In this Chapter the perspective shifts to examine how parties and their lawyers deal with the obligation of contract <span class="italic">during</span> performance. Now the parties are trying to make a contract work or to use the existence of a contract as the basis for a claim. A claim of contract breach requires proof that performance was due, and that the failure to perform caused injury of the plaintiff. To demonstrate breach, one must first determine what performance was due and that requires determining both what performance was promised and under what circumstances that performance became due. During the course of performance whether acting as counselor, advocate, or judge, the lawyer gives meaning to the obligations of the agreement by interpreting its express and implied terms in light of events subsequent to contract formation. The variety of subsequent events that may affect performance obligations is practically infinite. The goods may be late or off-grade, or only half of what was expected may arrive; the employee may not show up for work because of illness or accident; the employer may have no work because its major customer has suddenly gone out of business or because a storm has flooded the plant; the builder may be late completing the building because the architect’s plans were unusual and tricky, or the basement that was supposed to be dug from easily worked soil in fact must be hewn out of solid rock; the builder may be slow getting on with the job because the owner has been slow obtaining bank credit and making the progress payments.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page728" class="pagebreak">728</div>
<p class="indent">In each of these situations, a lawyer may be called upon to advise the client what to do next—what legal significance to give the obligation in light of the events. Or the lawyer may be called upon as a litigator to press or defend a claim of breach of contract. Or a judge may be called upon to characterize the obligations and events and determine the legal consequences for the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">Do not lose sight of the truth that clients make and perform contracts. Contracts are not the private preserve of their lawyers. Most contracts are made without a lawyer’s involvement, and most parties prefer to work out performance problems themselves, calling on a lawyer only when the situation has become a real mess. Contract law has evolved out of the resolution of disputes that ripened into litigation. An analytic structure built in this way sees the situation long after the conflicting claims have arisen and the relationship between the parties has soured. Law may come into the picture too late, and slant in the wrong direction, to help businesspersons manage problems as they arise. In litigation, courts are engaged in salvage operations at best, seeking to raise the hulk or apportion blame for the sinking.</p>
<p class="indent">As you study the law governing performance disputes, consider the extent to which that study provides helpful guidance in how to head off disputes at an earlier stage and assist businesspersons in reducing and avoiding costly conflict. In most disputes there are repeated opportunities for the parties to cure defective performances, to limit the loss by covering for the lacking performance in the market, and to communicate to ameliorate and define the consequences of the failure to perform. This communication may lead the parties to modify their relationship in light of the new circumstances but keep the deal alive, or it might lead them to move quickly and relatively cleanly into alternative arrangements with other persons. In any event, good communication during performance is likely to allow both parties to more efficiently accommodate to the situation than any lawsuit could.</p>
<p class="indent">The conventional doctrines and techniques available to a lawyer in dealing with performance problems are the subject of this Chapter. It will come as no surprise to the student who has gotten this far that the heart of the matter is interpretation of the terms of the contract: the words and symbols used by the parties; the additional terms implied by context, custom, usage, and prior dealings; and the terms supplied constructively by the law and imposed upon the parties. All must be discovered and weighed against the others in light of the events that now give rise to a dispute threatening the transaction. Beyond interpretation as such, the events must be fitted into an analytical structure to determine the legal consequences of particular failures of performance. This Chapter introduces you to the confusing and complex vocabulary that has grown up over the centuries to describe performance terms. Behind the complexities of terminology can be found a quite clear and simple set of useful concepts. The plan of this Chapter is to start with the basic ideas here and then show how to work with the confusing labels attached to those ideas.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page729" class="pagebreak">729</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Promises and Conditions.</span></span> A lawyer considering the legal import of a subsequent event on the contract relationship operates within a very simple system of classification. The basic distinction is that between (a) an event that is <span class="bold"><span class="italic">promised</span></span> and (b) an event that <span class="bold"><span class="italic">conditions</span></span> a promise.</p>
<p class="indent">If a party fails to do what it promised, its failure is a breach; a court may require it to pay money damages sufficient to provide the non-breaching party with the financial equivalent of performance. However, as you saw from the first cases after <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span> in Chapter One, not all promises are absolute; most obligations are limited by their terms. The promise is likely to be <span class="bold"><span class="italic">conditioned</span></span> on an event, so that until that event occurs, the obligation to perform does not arise. Thus, in <span class="italic">Mattei v. Hopper</span>, p. 31, the purchaser’s obligation was conditioned on the broker “obtaining leases satisfactory to the purchaser.”</p>
<p class="indent">The promise-condition distinction has crucial remedial implications. A failure of a party to perform a promised event is a breach of the contract, giving rise to legal remedies for breach, particularly damages. The failure of an event on which a promise is conditioned excuses performance of that promise—that is, it terminates, or at least suspends, the obligation of the contract. Breach of promise gives rise to damages; failure of a condition excuses the conditioned performance.</p>
<p class="indent">This simple promise-condition distinction may seem more complicated than it is because the two classifications are not mutually exclusive. An event that is a condition may also have been promised, so that its nonoccurrence may not only excuse performance of a counter-promise but also constitute a breach giving rise to damages. Conversely, the breach of a contract promise may also operate as a conditioning event terminating the obligation of further performance by the other party. Every contract term thus may be characterized in one of four ways: it may be a pure condition; it may be a pure promise; it may be both a promise and a condition; or it may be nothing, and its occurrence will have no impact on the parties’ continuing obligations. Damages for breach of contract are generally conservative, and the burden on the breaching party is likely to be relatively light or at least bearable. In contrast, the result of finding a discharging condition is that one side may lose the entire benefit of the contract without any compensation whatsoever.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the following illustration. On February 1, 2016, Seller agrees that for a price of $5.00 per bushel, payable September 20, 2016, he will deliver 1,000 bushels of Grade A wheat to Buyer’s grain elevator on September 10, 2016, and another 1,000 bushels on October 10, 2016. Seller agrees to do this so long as (a) the U.S. Congress does not increase the existing tariff of foreign wheat prior to June 10, 2016, and (b) Seller’s total 2016 crop of wheat exceeds 10,000 bushels. In return, Buyer agrees to accept the wheat and pay Seller his requested price of $5.00 per bushel.</p>
<p class="indent">The most obvious promises in the agreement are Seller’s undertaking to sell and deliver to Buyer’s grain elevator 2,000 bushels of wheat (1,000 by September 10 and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page730" class="pagebreak">730</span>1,000 by October 10), and Buyer’s agreement to accept wheat and to pay the purchase price. Whether Congress increases the existing tariff prior to June 10 and whether Seller’s 2016 crop exceeds 10,000 bushels clearly appear to be conditions that will affect Seller’s obligation to perform. Moreover, Buyer’s promise to pay would appear conditioned by Seller’s promise to deliver by September 10 and October 10. In other words, Seller’s timely delivery is both a promise and a condition. Apart from these explicit promises and conditions, there may be more subtle ones as well. Congress’ action on the existing tariff may well be outside the control of either party, but one may imply a promise on the part of either or both parties not to attempt to influence Congress to increase the existing tariff. And while neither party found it necessary to make explicit, one may fairly construct the condition that the promises need only be performed if Seller’s crop is not destroyed by fire, or perhaps even that Buyer’s access to the market is not disturbed by war, revolution, or total market collapse.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that a promise is conditioned does not interfere with the application of the contract formation and enforceability doctrines with which you are familiar. A promise is no less a promise because it is conditioned, unless, of course, the limitation is so extreme as to make it illusory. Recall Chapter One, Topic II. A contract is formed when the promises are exchanged. Neither party can then change his mind and withdraw without the consent of the other. Recall Chapter Seven. But if the conditioning event does not occur, the obligation to perform never becomes due. The tariff may be increased prior to June 10, 2016, or Seller’s crop may fall short of the stated 10,000 bushels. In either event, Seller doesn’t have to perform because he never promised to perform under those circumstances. And if Seller doesn’t have to deliver the wheat, Buyer won’t have to pay because her promise to pay was, in turn, conditioned on Seller’s delivery.</p>
<p class="indent">A closer look at the potential conditioning events underscores the centrality of interpretation:</p>
<p class="blockquote">1. Seller’s duty to deliver is expressly conditioned in the agreement on the tariff level. Congressional action on tariffs is out of Seller’s control, and Seller makes no <span class="bold"><span class="italic">promise</span></span> what the tariff would be. If the tariff is increased and Seller doesn’t deliver, Seller breaches no promise, and Buyer has no claim against Seller. An increased tariff prior to June 10, 2016, is an event that excuses Seller’s obligation to deliver wheat and thus gives rise to no breach or remedial claim. Seller’s obligation is conditioned on the June 10 tariff level.</p>
<p class="blockquote">2. The agreement also says Seller’s duty to deliver depends on the crop size. Unlike the tariff level, crop size is largely within Seller’s control. Again Seller makes no promise that the crop will exceed 10,000 bushels; if he plants a crop in good faith and it fails, Buyer can’t recover damages from Seller for non-delivery because Seller never promised to deliver under such circumstances. But <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page731" class="pagebreak">731</span>might the condition be interpreted to require that Seller at least plant a crop? Perhaps. The absence of an implied promise to plant might well negate any commitment in Seller’s conditional promise and render it illusory, a construction that courts often seek to avoid. Like the tariff level, crop size is a condition, but that condition may also give rise to an implied promise because Seller has some control over its occurrence.</p>
<p class="blockquote">3. Buyer’s duty to pay on September 20, 2016 is not expressly made conditional on Seller’s prior delivery of 1,000 bushels of Grade A wheat. But if Seller doesn’t deliver any wheat, no court would find that Buyer ought to have paid Seller anyway. Seller’s delivery is an implied condition to Buyer’s obligation to perform her promise. If non-delivery by Seller were not excused, it would of course be a breach of Seller’s promise, and Buyer would have a claim for damages against Seller. But non-delivery would also be the nonoccurrence of an event on which Buyer’s promise to pay depends. Seller’s timely delivery of Grade A wheat is both a promise and a condition: its unexcused nonoccurrence gives rise to a claim for damages. Even if delivery is excused by the failure of one of Seller’s conditions, non-delivery excuses the Buyer’s counter-performance of payment.</p>

<p id="sec364" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Merritt Hill Vineyards v. Windy Heights Vineyard</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1984.</p>
<p class="sectionb">61 N.Y.2d 106, 472 N.Y.S.2d 592, 460 N.E.2d 1077.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ K<small>AYE</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">In September, 1981, plaintiff, Merritt Hill Vineyards, entered into a written agreement with defendants, Windy Heights Vineyard and its sole shareholder Leon Taylor, to purchase a majority stock interest in respondents’ Yates County vineyard, and tendered a $15,000 deposit. The agreement provides that “[i]f the sale contemplated hereby does not close, Taylor shall retain the deposit as liquidated damages unless Taylor or Windy Heights failed to satisfy the conditions specified in Section 3 thereof.” Section 3, in turn, lists several “conditions precedent” to which the obligation of purchaser to pay the purchase price and to complete the purchase is subject. Among the conditions are that, by the time of the closing, Windy Heights shall have obtained a title insurance policy in a form satisfactory to Merritt Hill, and Windy Heights and Merritt Hill shall have received confirmation from the Farmers Home Administration that certain mortgages on the vineyard are in effect and that the proposed sale does not constitute a default.</p>
<p class="indent">In April, 1982, at the closing, plaintiff discovered that neither the policy nor the confirmation had been issued. Plaintiff thereupon refused to close and demanded <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page732" class="pagebreak">732</span>return of its deposit. When defendants did not return the deposit, plaintiff instituted this action, asserting two causes of action, one for return of the deposit, and one for approximately $26,000 in consequential damages allegedly suffered as a result of defendants’ failure to perform.</p>
<p class="indent">Special Term denied plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on both causes of action. The Appellate Division unanimously reversed Special Term’s order, granted plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to the cause of action for return of the deposit, and … granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, dismissing plaintiff’s second cause of action for consequential damages. Both plaintiff and defendants appealed from that decision….</p>
<p class="indent">On the merits, plaintiff’s right to return of its deposit or to consequential damages depends upon whether the undertaking to produce the policy and mortgage confirmation is a promise or a condition.</p>
<p class="indent">A promise is “a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.” (Restatement, Contracts 2d, § 2, subd. [1].) A condition, by comparison, is “an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due.” (Restatement, Contracts 2d, § 224.) Here, the contract requirements of a title insurance policy and mortgage confirmation are expressed as conditions of plaintiff’s performance rather than as promises by defendants. The requirements are contained in a section of the agreement entitled “Conditions Precedent to Purchaser’s Obligation to Close,” which provides that plaintiff’s obligation to pay the purchase price and complete the purchase of the vineyard is “subject to” fulfillment of those requirements. No words of promise are employed.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_143" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-143" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a></span></sup> Defendants’ agreement to sell the stock of the vineyard, not those conditions, was the promise by defendants for which plaintiff’s promise to pay the purchase price was exchanged.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants’ failure to fulfill the conditions of section 3 entitles plaintiff to a return of its deposit but not to consequential damages. While a contracting party’s failure to fulfill a condition excuses performance by the other party whose performance is so conditioned, it is not, without an independent promise to perform the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page733" class="pagebreak">733</span>condition, a breach of contract subjecting the nonfulfilling party to liability for damages. This is in accord with the parties’ expressed intent, for section 1 of their agreement provides that if defendants fail to satisfy the conditions of section 3 plaintiff’s deposit will be returned. It does not provide for payment of damages.</p>
<p class="indent">On the merits of this case the Appellate Division thus correctly determined that plaintiff was entitled to the return of its deposit but not to consequential damages.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec365" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The contract in this case provided that if the deal failed to close, seller would retain the deposit as its liquidated damages unless seller had failed to fulfill enumerated conditions. Buyer sues for return of deposit and for consequential damages. Judge Kaye finds that the failure to provide satisfactory title insurance was a condition on the buyer’s promise to buy, and not a promise by the seller, on the basis that the contract calls for the return of the buyer’s deposit if the conditions are not satisfied but does not provide for the payment of damages. She relies heavily on the absence of express words of promise. But recall <span class="italic">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff–Gordon</span>, p. 40.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower court opinion in this case suggests that seller could have met both terms but failed to, and that the buyer would not allow the seller more time to correct the defects. In other words, this decision may be understood as saying: “Buyer, you can go ahead and close by waiving the conditions or you can get out of this deal and recover your full deposit if seller fails to provide the closing documents on time. BUT you don’t also get damages.” Or perhaps put another way: “If buyer insists on terminating the contract on the closing date, the mitigation rule forecloses recovery of damages that could have been avoided had buyer granted seller an extension of time.” Viewed this way, this case is an example of the doctrinal conflict between “time is of the essence” in real property transactions and the defaulting party’s right to offer a cure of technical defects.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you expect that most contracts expressly provide that if a party doesn’t keep its promises, it will have to pay damages? What significance do you attach to the absence of words of promise? What other factors support Judge Kaye’s conclusion that she might have included in her opinion?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Does the court’s classification of the contractual provisions regarding title insurance and mortgagee consent as conditions determine that the only consequence of the non-occurrence of these events is to permit the buyer to get out of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page734" class="pagebreak">734</span>deal, or does the court’s sense that the only proper consequence of the non-occurrence of these events is to permit buyer to terminate (but not receive damages) determine the classification?</p>
<h4 id="sec366" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">A.   E<small>XPRESS</small> C<small>ONDITIONS</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">Parties commonly limit their promises when the agreement is made. They may expressly provide either that the obligation of performance will not arise until an event occurs (“upon tender of the full purchase price, seller will execute and deliver a deed …”) or that performance will occur unless the obligation is extinguished by the occurrence of an event (“I promise to paint your garage tomorrow unless it rains”). The limiting event (tender of the full purchase price or rain) is defined by Restatement, Second, Contracts § 224 as a condition.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, lawyers commonly refer to a term in an agreement that makes an event a condition as itself the condition. While most of us slip into this verbal shorthand, the distinction that the Restatement seeks to preserve between the event and the term that describes an event is significant. An event need not be expressly described in a contract in order to operate as a condition, but it may be implied by a court interpreting the deal, even though it is not necessarily mentioned by the parties. If a condition is implied by an interpreting court, it has precisely the same legal effect as a condition that the parties themselves took into account and expressly stated in the agreement.</p>

<p id="sec367" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Howard v. Federal Crop Insurance Corp.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, 1976.</p>
<p class="sectionb">540 F.2d 695.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ W<small>IDENER</small>, J….</p>
<p class="indent">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, an agency of the United States, in 1973, issued three policies to the Howards, insuring their tobacco crops, to be grown on six farms, against weather damage and other hazards.</p>
<p class="indent">The Howards (plaintiffs) established production of tobacco on their acreage, and have alleged that their 1973 crop was extensively damaged by heavy rains, resulting in a gross loss to the three plaintiffs in excess of $35,000. The plaintiffs harvested and sold the depleted crop and timely filed notice and proof of loss with FCIC, but, prior to inspection by the adjuster for FCIC, the Howards had either plowed or disked under the tobacco fields in question to prepare the same for sowing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page735" class="pagebreak">735</span>a cover crop of rye to preserve the soil. When the FCIC adjuster later inspected the fields, he found the stalks had been largely obscured or obliterated by plowing or disking and denied the claims, apparently on the ground that the plaintiffs had violated a portion of the policy which provides that the stalks on any acreage with respect to which a loss is claimed shall not be destroyed until the corporation makes an inspection.</p>
<p class="indent">The holding of the district court is best capsuled in its own words: “The inquiry here is whether compliance by the insureds with this provision of the policy was a condition precedent to the recovery. The court concludes that it was and that the failure of the insureds to comply worked a forfeiture of benefits for the alleged loss.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_144" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-144" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">There is no question but that apparently after notice of loss was given to defendant, but before inspection by the adjuster, plaintiffs plowed under the tobacco stalks and sowed some of the land with a cover crop, rye. The question is whether, under paragraph 5(f) of the tobacco endorsement to the policy of insurance, the act of plowing under the tobacco stalks forfeits the coverage of the policy. Paragraph 5 of the tobacco endorsement is entitled <span class="italic">Claims.</span> Pertinent to this case are subparagraphs 5(b) and 5(f), which are as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">5(b) <span class="italic">It shall be a condition precedent</span> to the payment of any loss that the insured establish the production of the insured crop on a unit and that such loss has been directly caused by one or more of the hazards insured against during the insurance period for the crop year for which the loss is claimed, and furnish any other information regarding the manner and extent of loss as may be required by the Corporation. (Emphasis added) 5(f) The tobacco stalks on any acreage of tobacco of types 11a, 11b, 12, 13, or 14 with respect to which a loss is claimed <span class="italic">shall not be destroyed until the Corporation makes an inspection.</span> (Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="indent">The arguments of both parties are predicated upon the same two assumptions. First, if subparagraph 5(f) creates a condition precedent, its violation caused a forfeiture of plaintiffs’ coverage. Second, if subparagraph 5(f) creates an obligation (variously called a promise or covenant) upon plaintiffs not to plow under the tobacco stalks, defendant may recover from plaintiffs (either in an original action, or, in this case, by a counterclaim, or as a matter of defense) for whatever damage it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page736" class="pagebreak">736</span>sustained because of the elimination of the stalks. However, a violation of subparagraph 5(f) would not, under the second premise, standing alone, cause a forfeiture of the policy.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally accepted law provides us with guidelines here. There is a general legal policy opposed to forfeitures. Insurance policies are generally construed most strongly against the insurer. When it is doubtful whether words create a promise or a condition precedent, they will be construed as creating a promise. The provisions of a contract will not be construed as conditions precedent in the absence of language plainly requiring such construction.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs rely most strongly upon the fact that the term “condition precedent” is included in subparagraph 5(b) but not in subparagraph 5(f). It is true that whether a contract provision is construed as a condition or an obligation does not depend entirely upon whether the word “condition” is expressly used. However, the persuasive force of plaintiffs’ argument in this case is found in the use of the term “condition precedent” in subparagraph 5(b) but not in subparagraph 5(f). Thus, it is argued that the ancient maxim to be applied is that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant places principal reliance upon the decision of this court in <span class="italic">Fidelity–Phenix Fire Insurance Company v. Pilot Freight Carriers</span>, 193 F.2d 812 (4th Cir.1952). Suit there was predicated upon a loss resulting from theft out of a truck covered by defendant’s policy protecting plaintiff from such a loss. The insurance company defended upon the grounds that the plaintiff had left the truck unattended without the alarm system being on. The policy contained six paragraphs limiting coverage. Two of those imposed what was called a “condition precedent.” They largely related to the installation of specified safety equipment. Several others, including paragraph 5, pertinent in that case, started with the phrase, “It is further warranted.” In paragraph 5, the insured warranted that the alarm system would be on whenever the vehicle was left unattended. Paragraph 6 starts with the language: “The assured agrees, by acceptance of this policy, that the foregoing conditions precedent relate to matters material to the acceptance of the risk by the insurer.” Plaintiff recovered in the district court, but judgment on its behalf was reversed because of a breach of warranty of paragraph 5, the truck had been left unattended with the alarm off. In that case, plaintiff relied upon the fact that the words “condition precedent” were used in some of the paragraphs but the word “warranted” was used in the paragraph in issue. In rejecting that contention, this court said that “warranty” and “condition precedent” are often used interchangeably to create a condition of the insured’s promise, and “[m]anifestly the terms ‘condition precedent’ and ‘warranty’ were intended to have the same meaning and effect.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Fidelity–Phenix</span> thus does not support defendant’s contention here. Although there is some resemblance between the two cases, analysis shows that the issues are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page737" class="pagebreak">737</span>actually entirely different. Unlike the case at bar, each paragraph in <span class="italic">Fidelity–Phenix</span> contained either the term “condition precedent” or the term “warranted.” We held that, in that situation, the two terms had the same effect in that they both involved forfeiture. That is well established law. In the case at bar, the term “warranty” or “warranted” is in no way involved, either in terms or by way of like language, as it was in <span class="italic">Fidelity–Phenix.</span> The issue upon which this case turns, then, was not involved in <span class="italic">Fidelity–Phenix.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Restatement of the Law of Contracts states:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 261. Interpretation of Doubtful Words as Promise or Condition.</span></h4>
<p class="blockquote">Where it is doubtful whether words create a promise or an express condition, they are interpreted as creating a promise; but the same words may sometimes mean that one party promises a performance and that the other party’s promise is conditional on that performance.</p>
<p class="noindent">Two illustrations (one involving a promise, the other a condition) are used in the Restatement:</p>
<p class="blockquote">2. A, an insurance company, issues to B a policy of insurance containing promises by A that are in terms conditional on the happening of certain events. The policy contains this clause: “provided, in case differences shall arise touching any loss, <span class="italic">the matter shall be submitted to impartial arbitrators,</span> whose award shall be binding on the parties.” This is a promise to arbitrate and does not make an award a condition precedent of the insurer’s duty to pay.</p>
<p class="blockquote">3. A, an insurance company, issues to B an insurance policy in usual form containing this clause: “In the event of disagreement as to the amount of loss it shall be ascertained by two appraisers and an umpire. The loss shall <span class="italic">not be payable until 60 days after the award of the appraisers when such an appraisal is required.</span>” This provision is not merely a promise to arbitrate differences but makes an award a condition of the insurer’s duty to pay in case of disagreement. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="noindent">We believe that subparagraph 5(f) in the policy here under consideration fits illustration 2 rather than illustration 3. Illustration 2 specifies something to be done, whereas subparagraph 5(f) specifies something not to be done. Unlike illustration 3, subparagraph 5(f) does not state any conditions under which the insurance shall “not be payable,” or use any words of like import. We hold that the district court erroneously held, on the motion for summary judgment, that subparagraph 5(f) established a condition precedent to plaintiffs’ recovery which forfeited the coverage.</p>
<p class="indent">From our holding that defendant’s motion for summary judgment was improperly allowed, it does not follow the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page738" class="pagebreak">738</span>have been granted, for if subparagraph 5(f) be not construed as a condition precedent, there are other questions of fact to be determined. At this point, we merely hold that the district court erred in holding, on the motion for summary judgment, that subparagraph 5(f) constituted a condition precedent with resulting forfeiture.</p>
<p class="indent">The explanation defendant makes for including subparagraph 5(f) in the tobacco endorsement is that it is necessary that the stalks remain standing in order for the Corporation to evaluate the extent of loss and to determine whether loss resulted from some cause not covered by the policy. However, was subparagraph 5(f) inserted because without it the Corporation’s opportunities for proof would be more difficult, or because they would be impossible? Plaintiffs point out that the Tobacco Endorsement, with subparagraph 5(f), was adopted in 1970, and crop insurance goes back long before that date. Nothing is shown as to the Corporation’s prior 1970 practice of evaluating losses. Such a showing might have a bearing upon establishing defendant’s intention in including 5(f). Plaintiffs state, and defendant does not deny, that another division of the Department of Agriculture, or the North Carolina Department, urged that tobacco stalks be cut as soon as possible after harvesting as a means of pest control. Such an explanation might refute the idea that plaintiffs plowed under the stalks for any fraudulent purpose. Could these conflicting directives affect the reasonableness of plaintiffs’ interpretation of defendant’s prohibition upon plowing under the stalks prior to adjustment?</p>
<p class="indent">We express no opinion on these questions because they were not before the district court and are mentioned to us largely by way of argument rather than from the record… Nothing we say here should preclude FCIC from asserting as a defense that the plowing or disking under of the stalks caused damage to FCIC if, for example, the amount of the loss was thereby made more difficult or impossible to ascertain whether the plowing or disking under was done with bad purpose or innocently. To repeat, our narrow holding is that merely plowing or disking under the stalks does not of itself operate to forfeit coverage under the policy.</p>
<p class="indent">The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The court decides that subparagraph 5(f) is not a condition to Howard’s right to recover on his claim for crop damage. Is subparagraph 5(f) a promise? What are the insurer’s damages for Howard’s breach of that promise?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Who should have the burden of demonstrating the existence of an insured loss? Could the insurer ever disprove such a claim if it had to carry the burden of proof rather than the farmer? As a result of this decision, is the insurer liable for however many stalks of tobacco the farmer claims to have lost?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page739" class="pagebreak">739</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Does it matter if the farmer plows the field under the day after the crop is allegedly damaged by rain or if the insurer delays sending out an adjuster for two months?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Note that the language of subparagraph 5(f) is somewhat ambiguous. What do you advise the insurer to do to avoid these problems in the future? Suppose the insurer printed a new policy form that began every clause in the contract with the following words in large red letters: “It shall be a condition precedent to each and every one of the obligations of the company under this policy that …”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Suppose the court did find subparagraph 5(f) to be a condition but Howard has a video recording taken after the storm but before the plowing under showing each and every one of his tobacco stalks in loving detail?

<p class="indent">It may be observed that both a promise and a condition are means that are used to bring about certain desired action by another person. For example, an insurance company desires the payment of premiums. One means of securing this desired object would be to obtain a promise by the insured to pay premiums; on failure to pay them an action would lie. In fact, however, insurance policies seldom contain such a promise; the payment of the premiums is secured in a more effective way than that. The insurance company makes its own duty to pay the amount of the policy expressly conditional upon the payment of premiums. Here is no express promise of the insured creating a duty to pay premiums, but … an express condition precedent to his right to recover on the policy. Payment by the insured is obtained not by holding a lawsuit over him <span class="italic">in terrorem</span> but by hanging before him a purse of money to be reached only by climbing the ladder of premiums. Before bilateral contracts became enforceable this was the only contractual way for a promisor to secure his desired object. He might offer his promise and specify the desired performance as the one mode of acceptance; or he might deliver his own sealed promise, making it expressly conditional upon the desired performance. In either case the promisee would have no legal right against the promisor, and could not get the purse of money, unless he first performed as desired. But as soon as bilateral contracts (mutual promises creating mutual duties) became enforceable, the courts observed that a promisor now had a new remedy and a new means of securing his desired object. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page740" class="pagebreak">740</span>Previously, in getting a return promise he got nothing; now he got a legally enforceable right. Hence, it did not appear unjust to declare mutual promises to be independent, and to compel a defendant to perform as he had agreed even though the plaintiff had failed to perform his part; the defendant had a like remedy in his turn against the plaintiff. It gradually became evident, however, that the contracting parties usually made no conscious choice of remedies, choosing the remedy on a promise rather than the advantage given by a condition. Often the remedy on a promise is very inadequate, and it is not surprising that the courts reverted to the earlier form. At first they seized upon such words as “for” and “in consideration of,” construing these to create express conditions. Later, by reading wholly between the lines, they found a supposed intention of the parties that the defendant’s promise should be conditional, or in the absence of any intention whatever they frankly constructed a condition in order to do justice according to the <span class="italic">mores</span> of the time. Thus grew up the rules of law concerning implied and constructive conditions.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec370" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">1.   Limitations on Express Conditions</span></h5>
<p class="indent">When a contract expressly denominates an event as a condition of a party’s obligation to perform, it gives that party very potent controls over the other—controls that in many cases are more powerful than any remedy available for breach of promise. Skillful drafters make full use of this control by incorporating in written agreements various express terms that they specify shall be conditions to their client’s obligation. At first blush, one would expect that a system committed to freedom of contract would give full effect to an explicit agreement by the parties that performance by one party was not required if the other party did not first fully satisfy all the conditions. After all, conditions are intended to fix the time and order of performance and to allocate the risks. But, there are limitations on the power of even the cleverest of lawyers to control the other party by sophisticated use of express conditions. Suppose, for example, that the landowner who contracts to have a large building constructed on his lot insists upon an express provision in his contract with the builder that unless the building is completed no later than December 10th, the obligation of the owner to pay for the building will be discharged. Suppose, further, that the overanxious (and overconfident) builder agrees to the contract with this term included. If the building (with a contract price of $15,000,000) is only 95% completed on December 10th, does the owner get it for nothing?</p>
<p class="indent">A court is likely to be very strict with a party seeking to enforce so harsh a condition and may find waiver of the condition on rather flimsy grounds. As you have seen in <span class="italic">Howard v. FCIC</span>, the process of interpretation also provides ample opportunities to avoid injustice. Moreover, “the law abhors a forfeiture,” and if the result of giving full effect to the condition is so labeled, the court will avoid enforcing it. In <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page741" class="pagebreak">741</span>addition to doctrine concerning interpretation, waiver, and anti-forfeiture, the law of restitution or the distinction between entire and divisible contracts may also be drawn upon to limit the untoward consequences of enforcement of such conditions. Finally, a condition may so limit a party’s obligation that it will be held to swallow up her promise and the consideration supporting enforcement of the agreement. “I will paint your house if I feel like it” is a promise so conditioned as to be illusory. <span class="italic">See</span> p. 27. Thus, although there is no general principle denying enforcement of the parties’ express conditions because they operate harshly, in many instances courts find other bases to limit enforcement of a condition that appears to operate in a harsh manner.</p>
<p class="indent">The lines that mark these limitations may sometimes be indistinct and wavering, for they are greatly affected by the relative positions of the parties and their respective bargaining power. Many of the trapdoors that are used by courts to allow parties to escape from express conditions may swing open only when there is a sense of moral outrage at shockingly unfair terms. Courts are more apt to relieve harsh conditions imposed by powerful drafters on parties with no realistic ability to bargain.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The Prevention of Forfeitures and Unjust Enrichment.</span> Relief against forfeitures originated, in English law, in courts of equity, which developed the mortgagor’s equity of redemption and gave relief against the penalties of penal bonds. The principle that one person should not be unjustly enriched at another’s expense originated partly in the equitable doctrine of constructive trusts and partly in the common law remedies for quasi contract. Avowedly and vocally the courts stay, for the most part, within these conventional lines. Yet under the guise of “interpretation” or “construction,” much is done by way of relieving against express conditions which entail forfeiture—a practice now partly recognized and placed on its true ground. With respect to constructive conditions, two points may be noted: (1) That “forfeiture” is sometimes to be taken in a broader sense than unjust enrichment; (2) that unjust enrichment is an influential factor in situations where the remedy is, or is conceived to be, contractual, not quasi contractual. As to the first, the process of determining when a party’s breach is sufficiently “material” to justify the other in ceasing performance is influenced by the extent to which the former has committed himself as a result of the contract, even though his commitment has not enriched the other party. Whether one calls this “hardship” or “forfeiture,” the principle is clear. The second point is exemplified in several ways. The rule that substantial performance of the promise is a sufficient compliance with the constructive condition to permit recovery “on the contract,” is apparently limited to cases in which the defendant has received the benefit of the performance. That “substantial performance” has been chiefly applied to building contracts merely shows that the “inarticulate and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page742" class="pagebreak">742</span>unconscious judgment” would be a better judgment if it were articulated. Another example is “severability,” which divides and weakens the force of constructive conditions and which is influenced by the principle of avoiding unjust enrichment as well as by the terms of the contract. The doctrine of “waiver,” which permits a partial failure of a constructive condition to be excused by loose and sometimes dubious manifestations of consent, is likewise influenced by the principle of unjust enrichment. Finally, the quasi contractual remedy for unjust enrichment has grown up alongside the contractual remedy, and even under the same procedural forms, to mitigate the hardships of constructive conditions. That it has grown sporadically and unevenly is another story.</p>

<p id="sec373" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Margolin v. Franklin</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Illinois Appellate Court, First District, 1971.</p>
<p class="sectionb">132 Ill.App.2d 527, 270 N.E.2d 140.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ A<small>DESKO</small>, P<small>RESIDING</small> J<small>USTICE</small>. Plaintiff, Essco Motors, brought an action against defendants Melvin and Betty Franklin to confess judgment on a promissory note. Defendants petitioned to open and vacate the judgment by confession and counterclaimed for $1,500.00 by reason of plaintiff’s fraudulent and wilful conversion of their automobile. The cause proceeded to trial. The court, sitting without a jury, entered judgment on the counterclaim in the amount of $921.00.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff appeals contending (1) the finding as to a modification in terms of payment of the contract was not supported by the evidence and is contrary to the established law of Illinois; (2) the defendant failed to prove the value of the automobile at the time of the alleged conversion; and (3) the plaintiff was deprived of a fair and impartial hearing due to the bias of the trial judge.</p>
<p class="indent">The facts adduced at trial are as follows: On January 31, 1966, defendants entered into a retail installment contract with plaintiff Essco Motors to purchase a 1961 Ford Thunderbird. The price was $1,352.00 on which defendants paid $300.00 down leaving a balance of $1,052.00. To this balance Essco Motors added finance <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page743" class="pagebreak">743</span>and insurance charges in the amount of $604.00. The Franklins signed a note in the amount of $1,656.00.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract called for 24 monthly payments of $69.00 due on the 15th of each month, commencing February 15, 1966. The Franklins made $69.00 payments on February 15, 1966, March 15, 1966, April 25, 1966, May 23, 1966, June 24, 1966, July 26, 1966, August 24, 1966, September 27, 1966 and October 27, 1966. On November 26, 1966, the plaintiff had the automobile repossessed and held a “technical sale” as it was described by one of plaintiff’s employees, because “we can get the car back after it is sold.”</p>
<p class="indent">The testimony of the parties differs sharply as to what transpired between April and November of 1966. Irvin Tyne, credit and collection manager of Essco Motors, testified the Franklins called and asked if they could make a late payment for the month of April. He told them it would be alright for that month. He further testified that in May the payment was not made by the 15th and he sent a reminder notice on the 17th and a final notice on the 20th. The May payment was received on the 23rd. The same situation occurred in June with the reminder and final notices being sent before payment was received. Reminder notices were also sent in the months of July, August, September and October since payment had not been made by the 15th of those months. Payments were made in those months on the 26th, 24th, 27th and 27th respectively. Tyne also testified he spoke on the phone to Mrs. Franklin in July, August and September and she stated in each instance she would make payment shortly.</p>
<p class="indent">In November, after the reminder notice was sent, Tyne called the Franklins at their respective places of employment and their home but could not reach them. He thought the defendants had “skipped” town and ordered a repossession of the automobile. The car was returned to the Essco Motors on November 26, 1966.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Franklin testified she spoke with Mr. Tyne in April and explained to him her husband had changed jobs and would not get paid until later in the month. She asked that the payment date be changed from the 15th of the month to the 27th of the month and received his agreement. The April payment was made on April 25, 1966. In May she received a notice from Essco Motors before the 27th requesting payment. She called Essco Motors and asked them about the notice. The man she talked to said the notice was sent out by mistake and that she should forget about it. Mrs. Franklin further testified she had no conversations with nor did she receive any notices from Essco Motors concerning the payments after the May conversation. In November, Mrs. Franklin testified she was in New Orleans about one week before the car was repossessed. The car was repossessed on November 25, 1966, from a parking spot in front of the Franklins’ apartment. The Franklins received notice that Essco Motors was going to sell the car.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page744" class="pagebreak">744</div>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff contends the finding of the trial court as to a modification in terms of payment of the contract was not supported by the evidence and is contrary to established law in Illinois. The trial court found the Franklins had not breached the contract with Essco Motors and the taking of their automobile amounted to wrongful repossession and a breach of contract on the part of Essco. The court believed Mrs. Franklin’s testimony that Essco Motors agreed to accept payments in the latter part of each month. The court stated its belief was evidenced by the exhibits at trial that showed Essco Motors accepted these payments. We agree with the trial court that the testimony and exhibits indicate a pattern of conduct on the part of Essco to accept payments from the Franklins on or before the 27th day of each month.</p>
<p class="indent">The law in Illinois is clear that a vendor may not establish a pattern of accepting time payments which may be slightly late and then suddenly insist on a strict compliance of the time provisions of the contract and declare a forfeiture of the merchandise. The Illinois Supreme Court has consistently held that the right to forfeit a contract is waived where the contract provides for prompt payment at fixed dates and payments are not so made and accepted after they become due. Where the parties have treated the time clause as waived with respect to some of the payments, the vendor, to avail himself of the right to forfeiture for failure to make subsequent payments on time, must give reasonable, definite and specific notice of his changed intention. The vendor in this case, Essco Motors after agreeing to a modification of the payment terms of the contract did not give the Franklins reasonable, definite and specific notice of its changed intention. Accordingly, Essco Motors could not suddenly insist on a strict literal compliance of the payment provisions of the contract and declare a forfeiture. We reject defendant’s first contention.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff-appellant next contends defendant-appellee failed to prove the value of the automobile at the time of the alleged conversion. In a conversion suit, the party alleging conversion must prove the reasonable value of the property at the time of the wrongful taking. In the instant case, on January 31, 1966, the defendants paid Essco Motors $300.00 down and executed a note for $1,656.00. The time sale price for the 1961 Thunderbird was $1,956.00. By the time of the conversion ten months later, defendants had paid Essco $921.00 of which $621.00 was in steady monthly payments. During those ten months, defendants expended $325.00 for an engine overhaul and exerted proper care and the maintenance on the automobile. On the basis of the evidence presented as to purchase price, engine overhaul, care and maintenance, period of use and depreciation, and balance due, we find that $921.00 is reasonable compensation to the defendants for damages incurred by the wrongful possession of their automobile.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff-appellant finally contends it was deprived of a fair and impartial hearing due to the bias of the trial judge. Plaintiff cites two examples of the trial judge’s prejudice: (1) The trial judge believed the testimony of Mrs. Franklin who was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page745" class="pagebreak">745</span>fabricating her story; and (2) the trial judge made remarks about car dealers and finance companies which show an attitude of distaste and prejudice towards persons in the time sale business.</p>
<p class="indent">As to the first example, the trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and because the judge believed the defendants does not mean he was prejudiced against the plaintiff. As to the second example, we have carefully reviewed the report of the proceedings, especially those portions cited to us by plaintiff-appellant in its brief and nowhere do we find the prejudicial statements allegedly made by the trial court. We find only allegations by trial counsel that the trial court made prejudicial statements. The trial judge himself expressed shock when counsel for the plaintiff made such charges at the presentation of the motion to amend the judgment. The trial judge denied making such statements and to emphasize his impartiality stated never before had he entered a judgment against the seller and repossessor of merchandise.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant, Essco Motors, has by innuendo and inference at trial and on appeal attempted to create the impression the decision of the trial court was based on prejudice and bias instead of the facts. This contention is without foundation.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec374" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What, if anything, might Essco have done differently as of May 15 to protect its right to enforce the due date expressly stated in its contract? How would different behavior affect the story that could be told at trial?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Comment c following the Reporter’s Note to Restatement, Second, Contracts § 229 states:</p>
<p class="blockquote1">C<small>OMMENT</small></p>
<p class="blockquotedi"><span class="italic">c.</span> When an obligee has acquiesced in an obligor’s failure strictly to adhere to a timetable of payment or performance, courts often are inhospitable to the obligee’s sudden invocation of forfeiture provisions. The courts may find a “waiver”—an implicit subsequent agreement modifying the requirement of strictly timely payment or performance; it may find the obligee’s acquiescence evidence that time was not of the essence; or it may treat the obligee’s acquiescence as a factor, which because it induced reliance, triggers the court’s power of equity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Did the Court deem Essco to have waived its right, to be estopped from insisting upon its right, or to have agreed to a modification? Is there a difference?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page746" class="pagebreak">746</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Should it be assumed that every time a creditor takes a lenient attitude toward a debtor in distress, the consequence will be a waiver of the original time set for payment in the agreement? Don’t people who finance cars for wage earners build in late payments as a cost of business?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Would it have made a difference to the court whether the contract itself stated that a history of acceptance of late payments would not constitute a waiver? In <span class="italic">Zinser v. Uptown Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan</span>, 542 N.E.2d 87 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989), the plaintiff purchased a truck and entered into a written installment loan agreement with the car dealership which was then immediately assigned to the Bank. The installment loan agreement provided: “Waiver of any default in the payment of any installment of the total of payments when due shall not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default. No extension of the time of payment or any other modification of the terms of this contract shall be binding on holder unless written consent thereof is given.” Before the first installment payment became due, the plaintiff lost his job. He promptly informed the Bank and requested a moratorium on future payments until he got another job, and the Bank orally agreed. When the plaintiff found new employment, he paid for the three months prior and for the following month. During the next six months, the plaintiff paid some of the installment payments on time and some late. Although the plaintiff believed he was current, the Bank asserted that the plaintiff was behind in three or four payments and, so, repossessed the plaintiff’s truck. Among the plaintiff’s claims against the Bank was “that despite the nonwaiver clause in the installment contract, the repossession and retention of his truck without notice or consent constitutes an ‘unfair act or practice’ where the Bank has condoned past defaults.” The court concluded that “[t]here is nothing in the [<span class="italic">Margolin</span>] opinion to indicate that the dealer’s repossession of the automobile without notice violated public policy or constituted an ‘unfair act or practice.’” But was it a breach of contract?</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec375" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">2. Conditions Precedent, Concurrent, and Subsequent</span></h5>
<p class="indent">Where an event must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance of a promise arises, the condition is said to be precedent. For instance, consider, “I promise to take your cows into shelter if it rains tomorrow.” Only upon the occurrence of the conditioning event—the rain—does any obligation to perform arise. If it doesn’t rain, the promisor need do nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">Where the occurrence of an event extinguishes an existent immediate duty to perform, the condition is said to be subsequent. So if Seller says “I will sell you my grain for $5.00 per bushel, unless Congress raises the parity support level above $4.25,” the occurrence of the conditioning event—Congressional action raising the support level above $4.25—extinguishes or discharges the outstanding obligation to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page747" class="pagebreak">747</span>perform. If Congress doesn’t raise the support level, the promisor must sell the grain.</p>
<p class="indent">The distinction between conditions precedent and subsequent is more form than substance. Words usually can be arranged in such a way as to make any condition appear to be a duty-discharging event (condition subsequent) or a duty-ripening event (condition precedent). For example, if a contract between Seller and Buyer states, “Seller agrees to perform on February 1 unless fire destroys Seller’s warehouse,” the destruction of the warehouse by fire appears to be a condition subsequent, discharging Seller’s duty. But what if the contract states, “Seller agrees to perform on February 1 on condition that fire does not destroy Seller’s warehouse.” Is it, as it appears to be, a condition precedent to Seller’s duty to perform, or is it only a condition precedent in form but a condition subsequent in fact?</p>
<p class="indent">Little consequence should be attached to such distinctions. As Holmes observed, “[I]n one sense, all conditions are subsequent; in another all are precedent.” Partly on account of Holmes’ criticism of this terminology, the Restatement, Second, Contracts defines conditions precedent as simply “conditions” in § 224: “A condition is an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due.” Restatement, Second, Contracts also drops the use of the term condition subsequent and treats the concept in § 230 under the heading “Event that Terminates a Duty.” Section 230 provides in relevant part that “if under the terms of the contract the occurrence of an event is to terminate an obligor’s duty of immediate performance or one to pay damages for breach, that duty is discharged if the event occurs.”</p>
<p class="indent">If little should turn on the distinction between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent, and if the Restatement avoids this terminology, why mention it at all? Historically, the distinction served as the basis for allocating burdens of pleading and proof in litigation. If a condition is labeled precedent, the party claiming breach must allege (and, if the allegation is challenged, ultimately prove) the occurrence of the condition as an essential element of the claim. On the other hand, if a condition is labeled a condition subsequent, the party defending against the claim must allege (and ultimately prove) the occurrence as an excuse for nonperformance.</p>
<p class="indent">At one time, this distinction was given great weight. Most conditions were interpreted to be precedent, and plaintiffs often found themselves pleading and proving the satisfaction of a great number of irrelevant conditions. Pleading rules required plaintiffs to allege specifically, and not generally, all facts relevant to the occurrence of all conditions. At the same time, pleading rules allowed defendant, by filing a general denial, to put these facts into issue, thereby requiring plaintiff to prove all these conditions were satisfied. The cumbersome, costly, and potentially unfair aspects of this system for allocating burdens of pleading and proof were substantial.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page748" class="pagebreak">748</div>
<p class="indent">Modern civil procedure ameliorates these problems. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(c) provides that “[i]n pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity.” Similar rules govern most state courts. Complementing these changes, courts have shown an increased willingness to allocate burdens of pleading and proof without relying on the labels <span class="bold"><span class="italic">condition precedent</span></span> and <span class="bold"><span class="italic">condition subsequent</span></span>. They seem sensitive to the difficulty of proving negatives; that one party or the other may be the best source of information about the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the event; and the very fact that the lengthy, standardized form may have been drafted by one of the parties alone, without opportunity for negotiation or dickering on the fine points of allocating burdens of proof. Nevertheless, in at least some jurisdictions the distinction between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent still matters. If the parties in fact intend to allocate burden of pleading and proof by the use of such language as “on condition that” or “but if,” no harm is done. One suspects, however, that the choice of such language is not generally consciously intended to perform this function.</p>
<p class="indent">Where each party’s duty to perform is conditional upon a simultaneous tender of performance by the other, the conditions are often described as <span class="bold"><span class="italic">conditions concurrent</span></span>. Consider, “I promise to deliver the bicycle to you if, as, and when you pay me $200, and you, in return, promise to pay me $200 if, as, and when I deliver the bicycle to you.” Since nothing is said about which performance is to come first, the law requires neither party to perform unless the other performs at the same time. Performance, or a “tender” of performance (an offer to perform in accordance with the terms of the promise and a capacity to carry out the offer), by either party thus becomes a condition precedent to an immediate duty of performance by the other party. Only upon the occurrence of the conditioning event—performance or tender by one party—does any obligation to perform arise in the other party. If neither side performs or tenders performance, neither party has a duty to perform, and neither party can pursue a remedial claim. When conditions are concurrent, either party can place the other in default only by performing or tendering such performance so as to assure the other party that the exchange will be simultaneous. Put differently, where performance is promised to be concurrent, it is a condition precedent to a suit by either party that there be at least a tender of performance.</p>

<p class="indent">Some conditions unexpressed in the agreement may be fairly said to have been intended by the parties, but others are implied as a matter of justice, irrespective of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page749" class="pagebreak">749</span>actual intention. As Corbin observed, “A fact or event may be a condition of a contractual right or duty, even though the parties had no intention that it should so operate, said nothing about it in words, and did nothing from which an inference of intention could be drawn.” Conditions that arise in this way are often called, at Corbin’s urging, “constructive.”</p>
<p class="indent">In this Topic we shall examine several commonly encountered constructive conditions, those that excuse performance based on impossibility, frustration of contract, and mistake.</p>
<p class="indent">The early position of the common law was that the occurrence of an event subsequent to contract formation was irrelevant unless the parties had expressly agreed that the event was a condition of performance. Even if an event had a devastating effect on the contractual relationship, the narrow logic of promise enforcement led the common law to stick to the letter of an agreement that made little or no sense under the unanticipated, but actual, circumstances facing the parties. Thus, judges were unwilling to excuse performance when supervening events had made performance of the agreement factually impossible. After all, liability for contract breach is not based on fault, and, hence, although it might be impossible for a party to perform, it would not be impossible to pay damages. Unless the parties expressly agreed to certain excusing conditions, therefore, they were held to virtually absolute liability in the event of nonperformance.</p>
<p class="indent">This narrow view was gradually abandoned, and courts became increasingly willing to read various excusing conditions based on the occurrence of supervening events into contracts, notwithstanding the parties’ failure to anticipate and expressly provide for them. The controlling idea is that the parties would have included the condition if they had thought about it. The court is not rewriting the contract when it reads the condition in but is merely conforming the agreement to the imperfectly expressed intention of the parties.</p>

<h5 id="sec377" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">1. Promises Implied by Social Expectations and Good Faith</span></h5>
<p class="indent">When a contractual duty is conditional, it may be necessary for a court to interpret the agreement to require the promisor to cooperate by refraining from conduct that may prevent the occurrence of the condition or perhaps even to take affirmative steps to make the condition happen.</p>

<p class="indent">Mattei’s duty to purchase was made expressly dependent on his satisfaction with the leases Coldwell Banker was to obtain for him. <span class="italic">See Mattei v. Hopper</span>, p. 31. In order to conclude that Mattei had sufficiently committed himself to buy and, therefore, that there was consideration to bind Ms. Hopper to her promise to sell, the California Supreme Court interpreted the agreement to require Mattei to act in good faith in assessing whether he was satisfied with the leases. If Mattei does not act in good faith in determining whether the leases are satisfactory, the nonoccurrence of the condition to his duty to buy (that is, the absence of satisfactory leases) is “excused,” and he would be obligated to buy the property despite the nonoccurrence of the condition. If Mattei does cooperate in good faith but is not satisfied with the leases, then his duty to purchase the property never arises because the lease condition is not satisfied. How much cooperation will do? What affirmative steps, if any, need Mattei take?</p>
<p class="indent">Broadly speaking entering into a contract is a form of cooperative behavior in which parties assume obligations to work together. Courts must consider the extent to which the contract implies a duty on one party to cooperate with the other in ways not explicitly required by the terms of the agreement. What did the agreement in <span class="italic">Mattei v. Hopper</span>, p. 31, require Mattei to do in seeking satisfactory leases, and what did the contract in <span class="italic">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff–Gordon</span>, p. 40, require Wood to do to satisfy his obligations under the arrangement? As these implied obligations are interpreted to require increasingly affirmative actions by a party, the interpreting court may appear to be “making a contract for the parties” rather than simply interpreting the agreement the parties made for themselves. Locating the appropriate outer boundaries of this judicial power raises difficult questions of policy and judicial competence.</p>
<p class="indent">Every contract contains obligations of cooperation, good faith, and fair dealing. The content of these obligations derives largely from the expectations of the community or business in which the parties are operating. The existence of these obligations is recognized by the Uniform Commercial Code. See § 1–304 (“Every contract or duty within this Act imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.”) UCC § 1–201(20) defines good faith to mean “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.” (Unless the contracting party is a merchant, however, many states continue to use an older formulation of the good faith standard that limits the obligation of such a party to “honesty in fact.”)</p>
<p class="indent">In accord with UCC § 1–304, the Restatement, 2(d) provides in § 205: “Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.” The Comments to § 205 state:</p>

<p id="sec379" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Parev Products Co. v. I. Rokeach &amp; Sons</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 1941.</p>
<p class="sectionb">124 F.2d 147.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>LARK</small>, J. This appeal involves the question whether or not an injunction should issue to enforce an asserted implied negative covenant in a contract granting an exclusive license to use a secret formula for a food product. In the District Court the complaint was dismissed on the merits on the ground that the parties to the contract did not intend a negative covenant. Although the District Court may perhaps have emphasized “intent” more than is realistic as to matters concerning which the parties have not revealed their thinking processes, it is, of course, obvious that the terms of the contract and the status arising out of those terms are of paramount importance. We turn, therefore, at once to the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1924, plaintiff, Parev Products, Co., Inc., entered into a contract with defendant, I. Rokeach &amp; Sons, Inc. At that time, as can be reasonably inferred from some of the terms of the contract, plaintiff was not in the best of financial condition. So far as appears, its principal product of manufacture was Parev Schmaltz, a cooking oil made from coconut oil in such a way as to be Kosher, that is, usable with meat and dairy products without violation of the Jewish dietary laws. Parev Schmaltz was then supposed to be manufactured by a secret formula made by plaintiff’s president, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page752" class="pagebreak">752</span>Aaron Proser, and, as the contract warranted, known only to him, Solomon Proser, and Julius Proser, though at the time a patent had been applied for on the formula and process. Defendant, on the other hand, was a successful business house of long standing. It engaged in extensive merchandising of food and cleansing products, mostly to orthodox Jews. The purpose of the contract, so far as appears, was to enable plaintiff to get out of its difficulties and to provide defendant with a Kosher semisolid vegetable oil.</p>
<p class="indent">By the terms of the contract, defendant obtained the exclusive use of all the necessary secret formulae, etc., for a period of twenty-five years, with an option to renew for another twenty-five years. In return, plaintiff was to receive royalties on all sales of Parev Schmaltz. Defendant had several powers to terminate, however. It could terminate the contract at any time it found the formula not to have been secret. Up to two years after the date of the contract, it could terminate the contract without cause upon payment of $100; and after two years, upon payment of $500. If any patents were judicially declared invalid, the contract was to terminate automatically. In defending any patent actions, plaintiff was to bear the full cost if suits arose during the first two years; after that, costs were to be split.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the agreement defendant was privileged to use Parev Schmaltz as it should “think fit for its use and benefit absolutely.” This same privilege was restated in another part of the contract with a complete specification of what was included, such as labels, trademarks, good will, and so on. For its part, plaintiff agreed not to engage or aid in the manufacture or sale of any product “similar” to Parev Schmaltz or in any business incidental thereto during the life of the contract; moreover, it agreed to deliver the agreement of the three Prosers not to “engage or aid, either severally or collectively, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture, sale or distribution of any article that might be in competition with [defendant] in the sale, manufacture and distribution of Parev Schmaltz or of any similar product.” Defendant promised after termination or expiration of the contract “not to engage in, directly or indirectly, in [sic] the manufacture, sale or distribution of the product Parev Schmaltz, or any product of a similar nature.” Defendant was privileged to discard the name Parev Schmaltz, however, and any name which was substituted would always remain defendant’s property.</p>
<p class="indent">It should be noted that the contract therefore contained at least three express negative covenants, none directly applicable to the case before the court, and that the one to be made by the Prosers as individuals is the more extensive in mode of expression at least.</p>
<p class="indent">Thereafter defendant immediately dropped the name Parev Schmaltz, adopted Nyafat in its stead, and commenced production. From the beginning, Nyafat was a success and during the fifteen-year period from 1924 to 1939, royalties of approximately $135,000 were paid over. In 1940, however a disturbing factor entered the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page753" class="pagebreak">753</span>picture. Defendant began the distribution of Kea, a semisolid cooking oil made almost wholly from cottonseed oil. Although defendant does not manufacture Kea, it distributes it under its own label as a Kosher product to the same orthodox Jewish trade. Defendant, of course, has not paid any royalties to plaintiff on its sales of Kea. Plaintiff claims that, since the royalties on Nyafat are based on an absolute sum per ounce and since the price obtained by defendant has been falling, defendant has undertaken the sale of Kea to avoid its royalty obligation. Defendant, on the other hand, asserts that Crisco and Spry, widely selling cooking oils, were cutting into the Nyafat market. This was aggravated, defendant says, by a nationwide price war which occurred as soon as Spry went on the market. Consequently, it is urged, defendant had to obtain a new product “similar” to Spry and Crisco, and in the same price range.</p>
<p class="indent">In this action, plaintiff seeks an injunction against any further sales of Kea by defendant. The theory is that we should imply a negative covenant on the part of defendant not to compete with its own Nyafat, or in any other way to interfere with the sales of Nyafat. Defendant’s argument is that no covenant should be implied beyond what it calls conduct on its part of a “tortious” nature, or, in the alternative, that any covenant would forbid only the sale of products of a “similar nature.” Kea, it says, is not similar. One is made from coconut oil, one from cottonseed oil. One is yellow, one is white; one is neutral in flavor, the other has an onion flavor. Other, somewhat esoteric, differences can be spelled out.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the District Court placed considerable reliance on this argument, we do not think that this should be finally conclusive. If any covenant is to be implied, it must be one which reaches the core of this dispute, which is the claim that a directly competitive product is produced by defendant. Whatever reasons there are for imposing on defendant such a strict obligation are hardly vitiated by the difference in composition of the two products. They are used for exactly the same purpose—shortening; if any covenant is to be implied, it would be hollow unless it took note of this fact. Thus, it seems rather unlikely that had plaintiff undertaken the manufacture of Kea today a court would have been content to say, as against a suit by the defendant, that the products were not similar under plaintiff’s express covenant not to distribute a similar shortening.</p>
<p class="indent">Should, therefore, a covenant be implied under all the present circumstances? When we turn to the precedents we are met at once with the confusion of statement whether a covenant can be implied only if it was clearly “intended” by the parties, or whether such a covenant can rest on principles of equity. Expressions can be found which insist on “intention,” which seem to combine both a requirement of “intention” and of “equity and justice,” and which by-pass “intention” and rely solely on equity. One may perhaps conclude that in large measure this confusion arises out of the reluctance of courts to admit that they were to a considerable extent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page754" class="pagebreak">754</span>“remaking” a contract in situations where it seemed necessary and appropriate so to do. “Intention of the parties” is a good formula by which to square doctrine with result. That this is true has long been an open secret. <span class="italic">See</span> 3 W<small>ILLISTON ON</small> C<small>ONTRACTS</small>, Rev.Ed.1936, § 825; Holmes, <span class="italic">The Path of the Law</span>, 10 H<small>ARV</small>.L.R<small>EV</small>. 457, 466; Fuller, <span class="italic">Legal Fictions</span>, 25 I<small>LL</small>.L.R<small>EV</small>. 363, 369; Chafee, <span class="italic">The Disorderly Conduct of Words</span>, 41 C<small>OL</small>.L.R<small>EV</small>. 381, 398.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_145" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-145" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> Of course, where intent, though obscure, is nevertheless discernible, it must be followed; but a certain sophistication must be recognized—if we are to approach the matter frankly—where we are dealing with changed circumstances, fifteen years later, with respect to a contract which does not touch this exact point and which has at most only points of departure for more or less pressing analogies.</p>
<p class="indent">Here defendant has a strong point in stressing the various extensive grants to it of the contract, as well as the express negative covenants which do not touch the present case. Undoubtedly extensive freedom of action was intended it. And yet that could not have been wholly unlimited, as indeed, defendant properly concedes when it admits that at least tortious competition or destruction of the Nyafat market was not open to it. And we must consider that in the period of time since the making of the contract there have been various developments which present a situation not clearly, if at all, within the contemplation of the parties at the time. Here a status exists upon which each party should be entitled to rely. What we should seek is therefore that which will most nearly preserve the status created and developed by the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">If we thus emphasize the situation existing today, two facts stand out. Plaintiff must clearly rely on defendant for any future benefit to be derived from its original formula; and defendant, if it is to continue to remain in the vegetable oil market, must be able to prevent the inroads of outside products, such as Crisco and Spry. So far as the plaintiff is concerned, it has long since lost its hold on its own formula. Nyafat is known to the public as a Rokeach product. Even were the defendant to release the formula, plaintiff would have some difficulty. This is not the controlling factor, for if it were, defendant might very well terminate the contract. Instead, the sales of Nyafat continue. And yet if no covenant is found, defendant to some extent can let Nyafat slip in sales, while Kea is boosted. In other words, if the defendant does not terminate the contract, it can keep Nyafat under its control until Kea is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page755" class="pagebreak">755</span>successfully built up, and then it can safely forget Nyafat. The advantage is all to defendant. But a court of equity should grant some protection to a person who parts with his formula for exploitation. Thus, a court would hardly have permitted the defendant from the inception of this contract to lock up the plaintiff’s formula in a vault and freely market Kea. There is no reason to do so now.</p>
<p class="indent">But defendant has an equally justifiable complaint to make. Kea, it asserts, is marketed only to compete with other products; and no attempt is made to injure Nyafat’s market. Certainly we cannot say that defendant must market Nyafat, come what may, down to the sale of a mere can a year, while the vegetable oil business goes to outsiders. That would as violently alter the status of the parties as would a decree of complete freedom to defendant. It is thus clear that a strict injunction against any marketing of Kea is unjustified. Yet a complete denial of relief to the plaintiff under any circumstances would not be fair either.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have previously suggested, defendant indirectly acknowledges the need for a middle ground when it argues that cases implying a negative covenant have as their rationale the requirement that the conduct enjoined be tortious. This, presumably, amounts to saying that so long as defendant acts in good faith in judging the extent to which Kea must be sold to meet the competition of Crisco and Spry, no cause of action lies. But this, it seems to us, is to state the rule too narrowly; a limited rule of good faith, valid so far as it goes, does not exhaust the possibilities. The really equitable solution is to permit defendant to sell Kea so long as it does not invade Nyafat’s market if that point is susceptible of proof, as we think it is. Thus, assuming that defendant is correct in its assertions, Kea sells only to people who no longer buy Nyafat.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_146" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-146" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> Hence, all the plaintiff is entitled to is the market Nyafat has created and will retain, regardless of outside competition.</p>
<p class="indent">An injunction to reach such a conclusion would be so vague as to be meaningless under present circumstances. Its practical effect would be to restrain defendant from any sales of Kea—which we have held to be unfair. Only by inserting “good faith” in the restraining order could defendant be protected; and this would be equivalent to the rule we have found too narrow. It follows, then, that on the present record plaintiff cannot obtain an injunction. A broad one would be unfair to defendant; a narrow one would be an empty gesture.</p>
<p class="indent">But plaintiff should not be denied the opportunity to show a loss of the Nyafat market as we have thus defined it. Plaintiff may be protected if it can be determined what sales of Kea represent loss to outside products, what sales represent loss to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page756" class="pagebreak">756</span>Nyafat. Expert appraisal of market conditions would, it seems to us, answer this.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_147" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-147" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> If loss were established, the measure of damages would be the amount of royalties on the displaced jars of Nyafat. On this record, the evidence is too fragmentary to be conclusive. Since an injunction was sought, the action was brought too soon to reflect the nature of the competition among the various cooking oils. If the plaintiff has further evidence of the inroads of Kea, it should be entitled to present it, either hereinafter in this case or in a later action.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed, with costs to defendant and with leave to plaintiff either to move to reopen the action, or to bring a subsequent action, for relief not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
<p id="sec380" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What is the result in this case? Does the court imply a negative covenant in this case? What are its terms? The Second Circuit may be understood as saying that the trial court was right to deny the specific injunction sought, but that the plaintiff is entitled to go back and try again. What will happen next time?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If cottonseed oil shortening is cheaper, looks better, and has superior cooking characteristics to coconut oil shortening and, therefore, will be preferred by 90 out of 100 consumers with a choice, how can Rokeach sell Kea without inevitably causing Nyafat to lose 90% of its market?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Rokeach has an option to cancel this agreement upon payment of $500. If it were to exercise this right and pay the $500, would it still be limited in its marketing of Kea? Why didn’t Rokeach’s lawyer tell his client to give notice of cancellation and avoid all this litigation?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Should a judge be as ready to imply a negative covenant after 15 years as she might be to find an obligation not to compete immediately after the contract was negotiated? The court is confronted with a contract that has been working for 15 years and has given rise to a network of relationships from which it is difficult to extract the parties. Perhaps, as suggested by Professor Michael Asimow, <span class="italic">Rokeach</span> is a case of the judge forcing the parties to go back and negotiate a settlement because he knew there was no way to determine this dispute by trial.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page757" class="pagebreak">757</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. The available information on the actual outcome of this dispute is instructive, for it reminds us that eventually all disputes are resolved, sometimes by events that have little to do with the actions of the parties or their lawyers. In 1988, the retired manager of I. Rokeach &amp; Sons informed us that after the Second Circuit decision, the product formula for Nyafat was radically changed because its major ingredient, coconut oil, became unavailable after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in late 1941. His best recollection is that in consideration for the termination of the agreement, Rokeach paid Parev Products a small amount. In 1945, after the end of the war, the original formula was restored, but nothing more was paid to Parev. Meanwhile, the competing product, Kea, was not well accepted in the market and was dropped by Rokeach within two years of its introduction.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ A<small>NTONIN</small> S<small>CALIA</small>, J., in <span id="sec381" class="italic">Tymshare v. Covell</span>, 727 F.2d 1145, 1152 (D.C. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he doctrine of good faith performance is a means of finding within a contract an implied obligation not to engage in the particular form of conduct which, in the case at hand, constitutes “bad faith.” In other words, the authorities that invoke, with increasing frequency, an all-purpose doctrine of “good faith” are usually if not invariably performing the same function executed (with more elegance and precision) by Judge Cardozo in <span class="italic">Wood v. Lady Duff–Gordon</span>, when he found that an agreement which did not recite a particular duty was nonetheless “‘instinct with an obligation imperfectly expressed.’” The new formulation may have more appeal to modern taste since it purports to rely directly upon considerations of morality and public policy, rather than achieving those objectives obliquely, by honoring the reasonable expectations created by the autonomous expressions of the contracting parties. But it seems to us that the result is, or should be, the same.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec382" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">2. Supervening Events</span></h5>
<p class="indent">Sometimes a party is unable to perform because of circumstances that could not have been reasonably anticipated or, at the very least, were unexpected. If the agreement does not expressly condition performance on a different state of affairs, the party must argue that the obligation was impliedly conditioned on the nonoccurrence of the present, unanticipated, circumstances. Even if circumstances do render performance impossible, the party’s excuse will only be accepted if the court determines that the promisor has not assumed the risk of those supervening events. While actual performance may be impossible, generally there is nothing impossible or impracticable about assessing damages for nonperformance.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, when a defendant claims excuse from performance because supervening events have rendered performance very difficult or impossible, courts are very likely <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page758" class="pagebreak">758</span>to hold the party to its promise despite hardship. Nevertheless, there is a limit. Relief may be available in a few cases on the basis of unforeseeable changed circumstances that create palpably unfair results, do not square with general expectations, or impose staggering burdens on one party.</p>
<p class="indent">This tendency cannot be pushed too far, or it will protect contract breakers from liability for losses caused by market risks or by their own failure to be prudent in protecting themselves. There are cases in which somebody once could have performed or now could, but the party involved in the particular contract can’t perform because it didn’t do soon enough what was necessary to enable it to perform. Courts find in these cases that the nonperformer’s present inability to perform is no excuse unless the parties have expressly agreed that it shall be one. Here the notion of fault obviously is a factor despite the dogma to the contrary.</p>
<p class="indent">Most students and some judges have trouble with the confusing vocabulary used regarding supervening events. The following cases will talk about four kinds of situations: impossibility, impracticability, frustration of contract, and mistake. There are differences between a situation in which performance is impossible and one in which it is merely so onerous that the label of impracticability applies. Frustration of contract is used to describe situations in which performance is not in any sense impossible for the party seeking excuse, but supervening events have made performance silly or futile. Overlying all these situations is the possibility that the problem is not a supervening event after formation; instead, the facts never were as the parties supposed; the contract is flawed by an essential mistake.</p>
<p class="indent">These terms all characterize factual situations that overlap broadly. As a result, more than one of these doctrines might fairly apply in a single case. It remains a mystery whether the problem in <span class="italic">Mineral Park Land v. Howard</span>, p. 766, is that some supervening event, heavy rains perhaps, made extraction of the earth and gravel impracticable, or whether, because of some miscalculation when the parties negotiated the deal, there never was as much earth and gravel there as the parties thought when they made the contract. Both factors might well have been present. Indeed, shifting to another example, Judge Teitelbaum in <span class="italic">ALCOA v. Essex</span>, p. 771, discusses the mess in which the parties found themselves in terms of impracticability, frustration of contract, mistake, and unconscionability. Your job in mastering this material will involve learning how events under a particular label (impossibility, impracticability, frustration, or mistake) differ from the others, while at the same time seeing the overlaps and interconnections among them.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec383" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">3. Impossibility</span></h5>
<p class="indent">The clearest category in which the excuse of impossibility is recognized includes contracts that require the personal services of an individual who is obviously unable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page759" class="pagebreak">759</span>to perform because of death or disability. It also includes contracts pertaining to specific property when the unique subject matter has been destroyed, as well as when a specified means of performance is impossible, for example, a contract requiring shipment by a specific ship which sinks before loading. Finally, it includes situations in which performance has become forbidden by law or governmental order.</p>

<p class="blockquote_inds">It is with great regret that I must ask to be released from my 1974–75 teaching contract after my 27½ days sick leave are used up. For personal reasons, which I have discussed with Mr. Swanson, I feel I must do this for the benefit of the students.</p>
<p class="indent">Though his resignation had not been accepted by the District before commencement of the school year, Mr. Oneal did not report for work. His offer of resignation, conditioned upon receipt of 27½ days accumulated sick leave benefits, was not acted upon until September 20, 1974, when the District, by letter, refused the offer. Mr. Oneal remained adamant in his demand that he receive sick leave as a condition of resignation in a letter dated September 25, 1974. The District then discharged Mr. Oneal, with notice of probable cause, at their regular meeting on October 3, 1974. The District further accepted his resignation but refused to pay accumulated sick leave benefits. We find this course of events, the coexistence of discharge and resignation, confusing, to say the least.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Oneal appealed his discharge directly to the Superior Court pursuant to RCW 28A.58.515, and sought damages including sick leave. The action of the District was upheld by the Superior Court, resulting in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">We are asked to determine by what method the teaching contract between the parties was terminated, whether through resignation by Mr. Oneal, discharge of Mr. Oneal by the District, or discharge of the contract by operation of law. In resolving the employment relationship between this teacher and his school district, we are governed by general principles of contract law.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page760" class="pagebreak">760</div>
<p class="indent">We hold that the contractual duty of Mr. Oneal to teach during the 1974–75 school year was discharged by operation of law through impossibility of performance. As regards impossibility, the trial court entered the following findings:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">That for several years plaintiff suffered from deteriorating eyesight which was the result of diabetes.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">That following the completion of the 1973–74 school year and prior to the 24th day of July, 1974, plaintiff became aware of the fact that his eyesight had deteriorated to a point where plaintiff believed he would be unable to perform his teaching duties during the 1974–75 school year.</p>
<p class="indent">That the court was finding as fact an impossibility of performance by Mr. Oneal in the 1974–75 school year, is made apparent by the court’s memorandum opinion wherein the court states:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">After the completion of the spring semester in 1974, during the summer recess, plaintiff became aware that his eyesight had deteriorated to the point where he would be unable to perform his teaching duties for the following year. The deterioration of plaintiff’s eyesight had reached the state where he was then physically incapacitated for teaching duties and the plaintiff knew and understood this to be a fact. * * * The plaintiff did make a final decision, prior to the beginning of the contract year, that he would not abide by the contract. It is true that he made this decision because he was physically unable to abide by the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The court’s findings of impossibility of performance are substantially supported by testimony in the record, and will be accepted on appeal. It was the testimony of Robert P. Reilly, Assistant Director of the Washington State Teacher’s Retirement System that Mr. Oneal had been found “disabled” from teaching duties in a medical report, and that he was thus eligible for receipt of disability benefits. His diabetic eyesight was found to be a continuing and progressively deteriorating condition existing in March, 1974, onward. Mr. Oneal’s difficulty with class preparation was corroborated by Darrell Woodside, a fellow teacher in the District. Mr. Oneal was forced to hold papers very close to his eyes and write in large letters. He was unable to use a regular grade book, and found it necessary to record grades on a second piece of paper to make them more easily read. Conduct of reading classes was made even more difficult by older textbooks in use at that time. Frustration with inability to prepare lesson plans during the summer of 1974 was echoed by Mrs. Oneal.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Oneal’s contractual duty was thus discharged by operation of law, by virtue of impossibility of performance. For these purposes, impossibility may be defined not only as strict impossibility, but also impracticality arising from extreme and unreasonable difficulty, expense, injury, or loss involved. Here, performance was impossible through greatly deteriorated eyesight.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page761" class="pagebreak">761</div>
<p class="indent">The court concluded there had been a breach of contract by Mr. Oneal and probable cause for his discharge. But because his duty was discharged by operation of law, there remained no contract capable of breach. Therefore, Mr. Oneal’s discharge by the District was without “probable” or “sufficient” cause within the meaning of RCW 28A.58.450, and shall be expunged from his employment record.</p>
<p class="indent">We now turn to examine Mr. Oneal’s renewed argument on appeal that he be awarded accumulated sick leave benefits for that period commencing August 29, 1974, the start of the 1974–75 school year….</p>
<p class="indent">A review of the present case shows Mr. Oneal’s contractual duty was discharged by operation of law prior to commencement of the 1974–75 school year. The complete failure of Mr. Oneal to perform under his 1974–75 contract, though discharged by operation of law, also discharged the contractual duty of the District, including that provision in the contract for payment of sick leave. With complete discharge of the contract before time of performance, the employment relationship of the parties ceased to exist. Mr. Oneal therefore “cease[d] to be employed” within the meaning of RCW 28A.58.100(2)(f) before August 29, 1974, ending his entitlement to receipt of accumulated sick leave benefits. Sick leave benefits were properly withheld by the District and the Superior Court.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment of the Superior Court affirming the discharge of Mr. Oneal is reversed, with order by this court that the discharge be expunged from his employment record. Denial of sick leave benefits to Mr. Oneal by the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec385" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. After receiving Mr. Oneal’s letter of July 24, 1974, the school board presumably had to find a new teacher. If it had to pay the substitute more than Mr. Oneal’s contract rate, should he be liable for the difference? After all, it isn’t his fault that he can’t perform, but contract damages don’t depend on moral fault, do they? As between the School Board and Oneal, who should bear that risk?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Is the court’s interpretation of the sick leave rules sensible? It seems to say that a sick employee is entitled to accumulated leave unless the employee is so sick that his performance of the contract is excused, in which case the employee loses accumulated leave. A bit like Catch–22, isn’t it? Suggest a simple sensible way out of the mess.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. This suit appears to be about 27½ days of sick leave benefits. Why would either Mr. Oneal or the School Board pursue this litigation on appeal after trial in the Superior Court?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page762" class="pagebreak">762</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Do disabilities that can be accommodated or ameliorated discharge the obligation of a contract if neither party wishes to accommodate? If Mr. Oneal could continue teaching if the School Board would afford him assistance with grading, does it have to do so, or be found to be in breach of the employment contract? If Mr. Oneal could undergo a risky medical procedure that might fix his eyesight, but refuses the operation, is he in breach? What if all he needs are stronger glasses?</p>

<p id="sec386" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Canadian Industrial Alcohol Co. v. Dunbar Molasses Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1932.</p>
<p class="sectionb">258 N.Y. 194, 179 N.E. 383.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>ARDOZO</small>, C.J. A buyer sues a seller for breach of an executory contract of purchase and sale.</p>
<p class="indent">The subject-matter of the contract was “approximately 1,500,000 wine gallons Refined Blackstrap [molasses] of the usual run from the National Sugar Refinery, Yonkers, N.Y., to test around 60% sugars.”</p>
<p class="indent">The order was given and accepted December 27, 1927, but shipments of the molasses were to begin after April 1, 1928, and were to be spread out during the warm weather.</p>
<p class="indent">After April 1, 1928, the defendant made delivery from time to time of 344,083 gallons. Upon its failure to deliver more, the plaintiff brought this action for the recovery of damages. The defendant takes the ground that, by an implied term of the contract, the duty to deliver was conditioned upon the production by the National Sugar Refinery at Yonkers of molasses sufficient in quantity to fill the plaintiff’s order. The fact is that the output of the refinery, while the contract was in force, was 485,848 gallons, much less than its capacity, of which amount 344,083 gallons were allotted to the defendant and shipped to the defendant’s customer. The argument for the defendant is that its own duty to deliver was proportionate to the refinery’s willingness to supply, and that the duty was discharged when the output was reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract, read in the light of the circumstances existing at its making, or more accurately in the light of any such circumstances apparent from this record, does not keep the defendant’s duty within boundaries so narrow. We may assume, in the defendant’s favor, that there would have been a discharge of its duty to deliver if the refinery had been destroyed or if the output had been curtailed by the failure of the sugar crop or conceivably in some circumstances by unavoidable strikes. We may even assume that a like result would have followed if the plaintiff had bargained not merely for a quantity of molasses to be supplied from a particular refinery, but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page763" class="pagebreak">763</span>for molasses to be supplied in accordance with a particular contract between the defendant and the refiner, and if thereafter such contract had been broken without fault on the defendant’s part. The inquiry is merely this, whether the continuance of a special group of circumstances appears from the terms of the contract, interpreted in the setting of the occasion, to have been a tacit or implied presupposition in the minds of the contracting parties, conditioning their belief in a continued obligation.</p>
<p class="indent">Accepting that test, we ask ourselves the question: What special group of circumstances does the defendant lay before us as one of the presuppositions imminent in its bargain with the plaintiff? The defendant asks us to assume that a manufacturer, having made a contract with a middleman for a stock of molasses to be procured from a particular refinery, would expect the contract to lapse whenever the refiner chose to diminish his production, and this in the face of the middleman’s omission to do anything to charge the refiner with a duty to continue. Business could not be transacted with security or smoothness if a presumption so unreasonable were at the root of its engagements. There is nothing to show that the defendant would have been unable by a timely contract with the refinery to have assured itself of a supply sufficient for its needs. There is nothing to show that the plaintiff, in giving the order for the molasses, was informed by the defendant that such a contract had not been made, or that performance would be contingent upon obtaining one thereafter. If the plaintiff had been so informed, it would very likely have preferred to deal with the refinery directly, instead of dealing with a middleman. The defendant does not even show that it tried to get a contract from the refinery during the months that intervened between the acceptance of the plaintiff’s order and the time when shipments were begun. It has wholly failed to relieve itself of the imputation of contributory fault. 3 Williston on Contracts, § 1959. So far as the record shows, it put its faith in the mere chance that the output of the refinery would be the same from year to year, and finding its faith vain, it tells us that its customer must have expected to take a chance as great. We see no reason for importing into the bargain this aleatory element. The defendant is in no better position than a factor who undertakes in his own name to sell for future delivery a special grade of merchandise to be manufactured by a special mill. The duty will be discharged if the mill is destroyed before delivery is due. The duty will subsist if the output is reduced because times turn out to be hard and labor charges high.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p id="sec387" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Does the fact that Dunbar Molasses might at one time have avoided the situation which eventually prevented its performance make it any less impossible for it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page764" class="pagebreak">764</span>to perform in the end? What, then, is the breach—nonperformance or action (or inaction) resulting in eventual impossibility? Is it, in other words, the fact of impossibility or the reason for the impossibility which determines whether or not a performance is excused?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What does impossibility excuse—the duty to perform or the duty to pay damages for breach of a duty to perform? Is “impossibility of paying damages” ever a defense to an action for breach of contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Suppose the defendant, Dunbar, had made a contract with National Sugar Refinery and that thereafter National Sugar breached that contract. Would Dunbar then be excused from its agreement with the Canadian Industrial Alcohol Company?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Note that in 1932 Chief Judge Cardozo was prepared to assume that the obligation to deliver the molasses would have been discharged if the particular plant from which it was to come was destroyed by fire, or if output was curtailed by failure of the sugar crop, but only conceivably in some circumstances by an unavoidable strike. It seems likely that the list of excusing causes would be longer today, but the uncertainty Cardozo expresses would persist.</p>

<p id="sec388" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Whitman v. Anglum</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors, 1918.</p>
<p class="sectionb">92 Conn. 392, 103 A. 114.</p>
<p class="indent">On the 5th day of March, 1914, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract in writing whereby the plaintiff agreed to purchase, and the defendant agreed to sell, at least 175 quarts of milk each day from April 1, 1914, to April 1, 1915. The contract contained the following: “The said Whitman is to come and get the milk at No. 1 Wawarme avenue, in the city of Hartford.”</p>
<p class="indent">The premises of the defendant are known as No. 1 Wawarme avenue. On the 23d day of November, 1914, by an order of the commissioner of domestic animals for the state, all the defendant’s cattle and products of his farm were quarantined. The defendant was quarantined, and he was not allowed to go from the premises. Shortly after the quarantine order, all the cows on the farm were killed. The quarantine was intended as far as possible to prevent all persons and animals from going on or off the premises, as well as to prevent the removal of products of all kinds that might carry infection of the “hoof and mouth disease” then prevalent among the defendant’s cattle. From November 22, 1914, the defendant failed to furnish or offer to furnish milk until March 13, 1915. From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant has appealed.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page765" class="pagebreak">765</div>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>HUMWAY</small>, J. (after stating the facts as above). This was an absolute and unconditional undertaking by the defendant to sell and deliver milk daily of the specified quality and amount. The defendant’s claim is that he was excused from the performance of the contract by reason of the quarantine, which made it illegal for him to leave his premises and carry away any products of his farm or any articles that might carry infection. The quarantine order did not make it illegal to deliver milk, nor make it illegal for the defendant to procure its delivery.</p>
<p class="indent">This much is conceded. But the defendant contends that the clause in the contract, to wit, “The said Whitman is to come and get the milk at No. 1 Wawarme avenue,” is an essential part of the contract, and, as delivery was to be made at the place named, therefore delivery under the terms of the contract was illegal. There is nothing in the record to show that the defendant could not perform his contract. While it may be true that the plaintiff could not enter the defendant’s house or go upon other parts of the premises which were under quarantine, it does not follow that the contract could not be performed substantially if not literally. The contract was not to deliver milk produced on the premises. All that can be said is, the defendant was under a temporary disability to perform his contract. He is not, however, released from the obligations of his contract because it was difficult or impossible to perform them, so long as the performance was not illegal.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no error. The other Judges concurred.</p>
<p id="sec389" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Was Anglum a wholesaler who dealt in the distribution of raw milk to dairies, or was he a dairy farmer who sold only his own production? What did Whitman think he was buying when he contracted with Anglum: 175 quarts of milk from Anglum’s cows or 175 quarts of milk?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Is this a question of impossibility or one of interpretation of the contract?</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec390" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">4. Impracticability</span></h5>
<p class="indent">Performance may not be literally impossible but may nevertheless impose a disproportionately heavy burden on one of the parties. While logically these situations merge into those in which the party is stuck with a bad bargain, performance may vary so materially from the parties’ expectations that it will be sensible to excuse performance in these circumstances. This approach treats impossibility as a question of interpretation, that is, did the parties contemplate performance under <span class="bold"><span class="italic">these</span></span> circumstances? As is generally true in matters of interpretation, judges have a large amount of discretion to achieve what they might regard as substantial justice.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page766" class="pagebreak">766</div>
<p class="indent">Because the law was slow and uncertain in excusing performance made onerous by supervening event, generations of contract drafters have included excusing clauses, known variously as <span class="italic">force majeure, vis major</span>, or Act of God clauses. A typical one reads:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="italic">Force Majeure.</span> Neither party shall be responsible for any resulting loss if the fulfillment of any of the terms or provisions of this agreement is delayed or prevented by revolutions, insurrections, riots, wars, acts of enemies, national emergency, strikes, floods, fires, acts of God, or by any other cause not within the control of the party whose performance is interfered with which by the exercise of reasonable diligence such party is unable to prevent, whether of the class of causes enumerated above or not.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the course of time, the expectations of lawyers, including judges, have been influenced by the commonness of such clauses. When the clause is not present, the court is very likely to imply its presence because all decent contracts have such a clause in them. This is a striking example of how the inadequacies of the substantive law motivate drafters to find solutions that, in the course of generations, become an expected part of transactions. These solutions, in turn, are integrated into the implied conditions judges will find in every contract, thus curing the original inadequacy of the substantive law. During the past generation this expectation found its way into the UCC and later the CISG.</p>

<p class="sectionb">California Supreme Court, 1916.</p>
<p class="sectionb">172 Cal. 289, 156 P. 458.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>LOSS</small>, J. The defendants appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $3,650. The appeal is on the judgment roll alone.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff was the owner of certain land in the ravine or wash known as the Arroyo Seco, in South Pasadena, Los Angeles county. The defendants had made a contract with the public authorities for the construction of a concrete bridge across the Arroyo Seco. In August, 1911, the parties to this action entered into a written agreement whereby the plaintiff granted to the defendants the right to haul gravel and earth from plaintiff’s land, the defendants agreeing to take therefrom all of the gravel and earth necessary in the construction of the fill and cement work on the proposed bridge, the required amount being estimated at approximately 114,000 cubic yards. Defendants agreed to pay 5 cents per cubic yard for the first 80,000 yards, the next 10,000 yards were to be given free of charge, and the balance was to be paid for at the rate of 5 cents per cubic yard.</p>
<p class="indent">The complaint was in two counts. The first alleged that the defendants had taken 50,131 cubic yards of earth and gravel, thereby becoming indebted to plaintiff <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page767" class="pagebreak">767</span>in the sum of $2,506.55, of which only $900 had been paid, leaving a balance of $1,606.55 due. The findings support plaintiff’s claim in this regard, and there is no question of the propriety of so much of the judgment as responds to the first count.</p>
<p class="indent">The second count sought to recover damages for the defendants’ failure to take from plaintiff’s land any more than the 50,131 yards.</p>
<p class="indent">It alleged that the total amount of earth and gravel used by defendants was 101,000 cubic yards, of which they procured 50,869 cubic yards from some place other than plaintiff’s premises. The amount due the plaintiff for this amount of earth and gravel would, under the terms of the contract, have been $2,043.45. The count charged that plaintiff’s land contained enough earth and gravel to enable the defendants to take therefrom the entire amount required, and that the 50,869 yards not taken had no value to the plaintiff. Accordingly the plaintiff sought, under this head, to recover damages in the sum of $2,043.45.</p>
<p class="indent">The answer denied that the plaintiff’s land contained any amount of earth and gravel in excess of the 50,131 cubic yards actually taken, and alleged that the defendants took from the said land all of the earth and gravel available for the work mentioned in the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The court found that the plaintiff’s land contained earth and gravel far in excess of 101,000 cubic yards of earth and gravel, but that only 50,131 cubic yards, the amount actually taken by the defendants, was above the water level. No greater quantity could have been taken “by ordinary means,” or except by the use, at great expense, of a steam dredger, and the earth and gravel so taken could not have been used without first having been dried at great expense and delay. On the issue raised by the plea of defendants that they took all the earth and gravel that was available the court qualified its findings in this way: It found that the defendants did take all of the available earth and gravel from plaintiff’s premises, in this, that they took and removed “all that could have been taken advantageously to defendants, or all that was practical to take and remove from a financial standpoint”; that any greater amount could have been taken only at a prohibitive cost, that is, at an expense of 10 or 12 times as much as the usual cost per yard. It is also declared that the word “available” is used in the findings to mean capable of being taken and used advantageously. It was not “advantageous or practical” to have taken more material from plaintiff’s land, but it was not impossible. There is a finding that the parties were not under any mutual misunderstanding regarding the amount of available gravel, but that the contract was entered into without any calculation on the part of either of the parties with reference to the amount of available earth and gravel on the premises.</p>
<p class="indent">The single question is whether the facts thus found justified the defendants in their failure to take from the plaintiff’s land all of the earth and gravel required. This question was answered in the negative by the court below. The case was apparently <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page768" class="pagebreak">768</span>thought to be governed by the principle—established by a multitude of authorities—that where a party has agreed, without qualification, to perform an act which is not in its nature impossible of performance, he is not excused by difficulty of performance, or by the fact that he becomes unable to perform.</p>
<p class="indent">It is, however, equally well settled that, where performance depends upon the existence of a given thing, and such existence was assumed as the basis of the agreement, performance is excused to the extent that the thing ceases to exist or turns out to be nonexistent. Thus, where the defendants had agreed to pasture not less than 3,000 cattle on plaintiff’s land, paying therefor $1 for each and every head so pastured, and it developed that the land did not furnish feed for more than 717 head, the number actually put on the land by defendant, it was held that plaintiff could not recover the stipulated sum for the difference between the cattle pastured and the minimum of 3,000 agreed to be pastured. Similarly, in <span class="italic">Brick Co. v. Pond</span>, where the plaintiff had leased all the “good No. 1 fire clay on his land,” subject to the condition that the lessees should mine or pay for not less than 2,000 tons of clay every year, paying therefor 25 cents per ton, the court held that the lessees were not bound to pay for 2,000 tons per year, unless there was No. 1 clay on the land in such quantities as would justify its being taken out. In <span class="italic">Ridgely v. Conewago Iron Co</span>. the holding was that a mining lease requiring the lessee to mine 4,000 tons of ore annually, and to pay therefor a fixed sum per ton, or, failing to take out such quantity, to pay therefor, imposed no obligation on the lessee to pay for such stipulated quantity after the ore in the demised premises had become exhausted. There are many other cases dealing with mining leases of this character, and the general course of decision is to the effect that the performance of the obligation to take out a given quantity or to pay royalty thereon, if it be not taken out, is excused if it appears that the land does not contain the stipulated quantity.</p>
<p class="indent">We think the findings of fact make a case falling within the rule of these decisions. The parties were contracting for the right to take earth and gravel to be used in the construction of the bridge. When they stipulated that all of the earth and gravel needed for this purpose should be taken from plaintiff’s land, they contemplated and assumed that the land contained the requisite quantity, available for use. The defendants were not binding themselves to take what was not there. And, in determining whether the earth and gravel were “available,” we must view the conditions in a practical and reasonable way. Although there was gravel on the land, it was so situated that the defendants could not take it by ordinary means, nor except at a prohibitive cost. To all fair intents then, it was impossible for defendants to take it. “A thing is impossible in legal contemplation when it is not practicable; and a thing is impracticable when it can only be done at an excessive and unreasonable cost.” 1 Beach on Contr. § 216. We do not mean to intimate that the defendants could excuse themselves by showing the existence of conditions which would make <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page769" class="pagebreak">769</span>the performance of their obligation more expensive than they had anticipated, or which would entail a loss upon them. But, where the difference in cost is so great as here, and has the effect, as found, of making performance impracticable, the situation is not different from that of a total absence of earth and gravel.</p>
<p class="indent">On the facts found, there should have been no recovery on the second count.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment is modified by deducting therefrom the sum of $2,043.45, and, as so modified, it stands affirmed.</p>

<h5 id="sec396" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">5. Frustration of Contract</span></h5>
<p class="indent">A party’s performance is not literally impossible if it is merely called upon, for example, to pay money for a counterperformance which has lost all meaning because of the occurrence of a supervening event. Consider the lease of property for a service station along a busy highway in a remote area. If the State builds a highway nearby that diverts all but a small fraction of the traffic, can the lessee claim an excuse from paying high rent premised on a large volume of through traffic? The lessee still has the property, and payment is not impossible. Is the situation different if the State decides to fight global warming by outlawing gasoline-fueled motor vehicles? Must the tenant continue to pay rent if the site could still be used as rest stop for passing travelers even though it could no longer legally sell gasoline? Doesn’t such change go to the heart of the transaction and suggest an implied condition of the contract that such change frustrates the contract and excuses performance?</p>
<p class="indent">The classic cases in this area are the so-called <span class="italic">Coronation Cases</span>, <span class="italic">Krell v. Henry</span>, 2 K.B. 740 (1903) and <span class="italic">Chandler v. Webster</span>, 1 K.B. 493 (1904). In 1902, King Edward VII was to be crowned in a spectacular ceremony at Westminster Abbey coupled with an equally spectacular parade along Pall Mall. Rooms along Pall Mall with a view of the parade route were rented for exorbitant sums. But shortly before the event the King fell ill with appendicitis and the parade was cancelled. In subsequent litigation over the room rentals on Pall Mall, the English courts held the contacts frustrated and discharged by the supervening event of the King’s illness and the cancellation of the parade. Interestingly, only future performance was discharged, that is deposits paid could not be recovered but monies not yet due at the time the King fell ill did not have to be paid. This result was later codified in the United Kingdom by the Frustrated Contracts Act of 1943 (Aug. 5, 1943).</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec397" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">6. Mistake</span></h5>
<p class="indent">Doctrines of impossibility, impracticability, and frustration of contract are applied when supervening events upset the expectations that the parties had or are deemed to have had when they made the contract. But what if the facts and circumstances were never as the parties assumed? From the viewpoint of the court being asked to intervene, a case in which there has been a serious mistake in the assumptions underlying the agreement is very similar to a case of impossibility caused by supervening unforeseen events. One of the parties is seeking to be relieved from a catastrophic loss because performance of the contract has turned out to be a very different thing than was originally contemplated. As in impossibility cases, those involving mistaken assumptions lend themselves to the construction of an implied condition that excuses performance or to an analysis that “the true construction of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page772" class="pagebreak">772</span>the contract” is that the parties did not intend performance under these circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">Two root ideas already discussed under impossibility apply also to mistake in assumption. On the one hand, the parties have made a deal, and it should be performed. At the same time, if the mistake is sufficiently material to the deal, the agreement is unlikely to be very sensible if the assumptions turn out to be incorrect. Also arguing against enforcement is our sense that it is inequitable for a party to insist on performance of the contract when it is clear that because of a mistake—even though it was without fault—there is a gross and obvious lack of equivalence in what the parties actually exchanged. It seems unfair that a person should be able to insist on delivery of a diamond for the price of a pebble or collect the price of a diamond for a mere pebble. Sensible courts seek to avoid this kind of commercial catastrophe.</p>
<p class="indent">In many contract situations, however, the chance that things wouldn’t work out as the parties expected was part of the deal and a factor in the negotiations. The contract price may reflect the risks assumed by one side, and the distribution of risks of different kinds may be a major function of the contract terms. When the subject of the erroneous assumptions is speculative, when a warranty is made by one side, or when the contract is aleatory in nature, there is less interest in relieving the injured party of its mistake.</p>
<p class="indent">This concern with placing the risk of loss on one party or the other may be the sensible part of the distinction courts often claim to draw between “mutual” and “unilateral” mistake. As often stated, relief may be granted for a mutual, but not for a unilateral, mistake. The case law in this area is confused beyond reconciliation. Courts cannot agree on what is “mutual” and what is “unilateral,” and in many jurisdictions cases can be found in which relief is granted in both situations, however they are defined. But when courts talk about unilateral mistake, they often seem to be indicating that the mistake was as to a matter peculiarly the concern of one party who assumed the risk of its existence. When an assumption goes to the heart of the bargain, the parties’ interest in it is mutual, and a serious mistake as to that assumption is likely to render the performance excused.</p>
<p class="indent">Judge Teitelbaum’s famous opinion in <span class="italic">Aluminum Company of America v. Essex Group, Inc. (“ALCOA”)</span> grapples with these distinctions between “mutual” and “unilateral” mistake. ALCOA and Essex were competitors in the aluminum wire and cable business. ALCOA is also a very large vertically integrated producer of aluminum products. That is, it mines, transports, smelts, processes, fabricates, and markets aluminum from ore to finished products. Essex needed a reliable source of supply for its business and originally planned simply to enter into a toll conversion contract, under which Essex would purchase ore and turn it over to ALCOA, who would convert the ore into molten aluminum that would be delivered in its molten <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page773" class="pagebreak">773</span>state to Essex. This meant that Essex’s plant would be next door to and physically connected to ALCOA’s, so that the liquid aluminum could flow economically from one to the other. Essex shopped around for a source of aluminum ore and for a steamship company to carry the ore to the plant. It ended up buying the ore from ALCOA of Australia Proprietary Ltd., an Australian corporation, 51% of which is owned by ALCOA. All ore supplied under this contract was carried from Australia to the plant in vessels of the ALCOA Steamship Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of ALCOA. The connections between ALCOA and Essex were intimate and tangled.</p>
<p class="indent">Why did the parties enter into this kind of a deal? Part of the answer probably lies in the antitrust laws. Aluminum production requires a high level of specialized technical competence and a great deal of capital investment in plant and equipment. These requirements discourage potential competitors from entering this business. Historically these barriers were reinforced by industrial property rights to the central process for the electrolytic reduction of aluminum from ore. ALCOA held patents to the process of electrically smelting aluminum metal from ore and, accordingly, for many years lawfully monopolized aluminum production in the United States and a number of other countries. During the 1930’s ALCOA was successfully prosecuted by the Government under the antitrust laws as a monopolist. Although ALCOA’s monopoly was effectively broken during World War II, when two other independent producers were brought into the industry with Government help, it remains a dominant participant in the industry. As such, it must be very careful how it deals with customers like Essex, who are also its competitors in the sale and distribution of finished goods. It is always caught on the horns of a dilemma between treating its competitors too harshly and thus abusing its dominant market position, or cooperating rather than competing with its competitors and running the risk of being found to have conspired with its competitors to restrain trade. In its dealings with Essex, for example, several ALCOA executives who held positions both in the parent firm and in its Australian subsidiary were constrained on the advice of counsel to insulate themselves so that they would not be involved in any way in the negotiations of both the smelting deal and the ore purchase contract. Sometimes, even 600 pound gorillas have to be careful where they sit down.</p>

<p class="sectionb">United States District Court, W.D. Pennsylvania, 1980.</p>
<p class="sectionb">499 F.Supp. 53.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ T<small>EITELBAUM</small>, D.J….</p>
<p class="indent">By December 26, 1967 the parties had entered into … [a] service contract known as the Molten Metal Agreement under which Essex would supply ALCOA with alumina which ALCOA would convert by a smelting process into molten aluminum….</p>
<p class="indent">The price provisions of the contract contained an escalation formula which indicates that $.03 per pound of the original price escalates in accordance with changes in the Wholesale Price Index–Industrial Commodities (WPI) and $.03 per pound escalates in accordance with an index based on the average hourly labor rates paid to ALCOA employees at the Warrick plant. The portion of the pricing formula which is in issue in this case under counts one and two is the production charge which is escalated by the WPI. ALCOA contends that this charge was intended by the parties to reflect actual changes in the cost of the non-labor items utilized by ALCOA in the production of aluminum from alumina at its Warrick, Indiana smelting plant. In count one of this suit ALCOA asserts that the WPI used in the Molten Metal Agreement was in fact incapable of reasonably reflecting changes in the non-labor costs at ALCOA’s Warrick, Indiana smelting plant and has in fact failed to so reflect such changes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court finds, based upon consideration of all the evidence, that ALCOA is entitled to reformation of the Molten Metal Agreement….</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C<small>OUNT</small> O<small>NE</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">ALCOA’s first count seeks an equitable modification of the contract price for its services. The pleadings, arguments and briefs frame the issue in several forms. ALCOA seeks reformation or modification of the price on the basis of mutual mistake of fact, unilateral mistake of fact, unconscionability, frustration of purpose, and commercial impracticability.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The facts pertinent to count one are few and simple. In 1967 ALCOA and Essex entered into a written contract in which ALCOA promised to convert specified amounts of alumina supplied by Essex into aluminum for Essex. The service is to be performed at the ALCOA works at Warrick, Indiana. The contract is to run until the end of 1983. Essex has the option to extend it until the end of 1988. The price for each pound of aluminum converted is calculated by a complex formula which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page775" class="pagebreak">775</span>includes three variable components based on specific indices. The initial contract price was set at fifteen cents per pound, computed as follows:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="./pg775.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="indent">The demand charge is to vary from its initial base in direct proportion to periodic changes in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost–20 Cities Average Index published in the Engineering News Record. The Non-labor Production Cost Component is to vary from its initial base in direct proportion to periodic changes in the Wholesale Price Index–Industrial Commodities (WPI–IC) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. The Labor Production Cost Component is to vary from its initial base in direct proportion to periodic changes in ALCOA’s average hourly labor cost at the Warrick, Indiana works. The adjusted price is subject to an overall “cap” price of 65% of the price of a specified type of aluminum sold on specified terms, as published in a trade journal, American Metal Market.</p>
<p class="indent">The indexing system was evolved by ALCOA with the aid of the eminent economist Alan Greenspan. ALCOA examined the non-labor production cost component to assure that the WPI–IC had not tended to deviate markedly from their non-labor cost experience in the years before the contract was executed. Essex agreed to the contract including the index provisions after an examination of the past record of the indices revealed an acceptable pattern of stability.</p>
<p class="indent">ALCOA sought, by the indexed price agreement, to achieve a stable net income of about four cents per pound of aluminum converted. This net income represented ALCOA’s return (i) on its substantial capital investment devoted to the performance of the contracted services, (ii) on its management, and (iii) on the risks of short-falls or losses it undertook over an extended period. The fact that the non-labor production cost component of ALCOA’s costs was priced according to a surrogate, objective index opened the door to a foreseeable fluctuation of ALCOA’s return due to deviations between ALCOA’s costs and the performance of the WPI–IC. The range of foreseeable deviation was roughly three cents per pound. That is to say that in some years ALCOA’s return might foreseeably (and did, in fact) rise to seven cents per pound, while in other years it might foreseeably (and did, in fact) fall to about one cent per pound.</p>
<p class="indent">Essex sought to assure itself of a long term supply of aluminum at a favorable price. Essex intended to and did manufacture a new line of aluminum wire products. The long term supply of aluminum was important to assure Essex of the steady use <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page776" class="pagebreak">776</span>of its expensive machinery. A steady production stream was vital to preserve the market position it sought to establish. The favorable price was important to allow Essex to compete with firms like ALCOA which produced the aluminum and manufactured aluminum wire products in an efficient, integrated operation.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early years of the contract, the price formula yielded prices related, within the foreseeable range of deviation, to ALCOA’s cost figures. Beginning in 1973, OPEC actions to increase oil prices and unanticipated pollution control costs greatly increased ALCOA’s electricity costs. Electric power is the principal non-labor cost factor in aluminum conversion, and the electric power rates rose much more rapidly than did the WPI–IC. As a result, ALCOA’s production costs rose greatly and unforeseeably beyond the indexed increase in the contract price….</p>
<p class="indent">During the most recent years, the market price of aluminum has increased even faster than the production costs. At the trial ALCOA introduced the deposition of Mr. Wilfred Jones, an Essex employee whose duties included the sale of surplus metal. Mr. Jones stated that Essex had resold some millions of pounds of aluminum which ALCOA had refined. The cost of the aluminum to Essex (including the purchase price of the alumina and its transportation) was 36.35 cents per pound around June of 1979. Mr. Jones further stated that the resale price in June 1979 at one cent per pound under the market, was 73.313 cents per pound, yielding Essex a gross profit of 37.043 cents per pound. This margin of profit shows the tremendous advantage Essex enjoys under the contract as it is written and as both parties have performed it. A significant fraction of Essex’s advantage is directly attributable to the corresponding out of pocket losses ALCOA suffers. ALCOA has sufficiently shown that without judicial relief or economic changes which are not presently foreseeable, it stands to lose in excess of $75,000,000 out of pocket, during the remaining term of the contract.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">* * *</span></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p class="indent">ALCOA initially argues that it is entitled to relief on the theory of mutual mistake. ALCOA contends that both parties were mistaken in their estimate of the suitability of the WPI–IC as an objective index of ALCOA’s non-labor production costs, and that their mistake is legally sufficient to warrant modification or avoidance of ALCOA’s promise. Essex appropriately raised several defenses to these claims. Essex first argues that the asserted mistake is legally insufficient because it is essentially a mistake as to future economic events rather than a mistake of fact. Essex next argues that ALCOA assumed or bore the risk of the mistake. Essex finally argues that the requested remedy of reformation is not available under Indiana law.</p>
<p class="indent">The late Professor Corbin wrote the best modern analysis of the doctrine of mutual mistake. Corbin took pains to show the great number and variety of factors which must be considered in resolving claims for relief founded on the doctrine of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page777" class="pagebreak">777</span>mistake, and to show the inappropriateness of any single verbal rule to govern the decision of mistake cases. Corbin on Contracts § 597 at 582–83 (1960).</p>
<p class="indent">The present case involves a claimed mistake in the price indexing formula. This is clearly a mistake concerning a factor affecting the value of the agreed exchange. Of such mistakes Corbin concluded that the law must consider the character of the risks assumed by the parties. He further concluded:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In these cases, the decision involves a judgment as to the materiality of the alleged factor, and as to whether the parties made a definite assumption that it existed and made their agreement in the belief that there was <span class="italic">no risk</span> with respect to it. Opinions are almost sure to differ on both of these matters, so that decisions must be, or appear to be, conflicting. The court’s judgment on each of them is a judgment on a matter of fact, not a judgment as to law. No rule of thumb should be constructed for cases of this kind.</p>
<p class="indent">The new Restatement 2d of Contracts follows a similar approach….</p>
<p class="indent">Both Professor Corbin and the Restatement emphasize the limited place of the doctrine of mistake in the law of contracts. They, along with most modern commentators, emphasize the importance of contracts as devices to allocate the risks of life’s uncertainties, particularly economic uncertainties. Where parties to a contract deliberately and expressly undertake to allocate the risk of loss attendant on those uncertainties between themselves or where they enter a contract of a customary kind which by common understanding, sense, and legal doctrine has the effect of allocating such risks, the commentators and the opinions are agreed that there is little room for judicial relief from resulting losses. The new Restatement agrees, § 296. This is, in part, the function of the doctrine of assumption of the risk as a limitation of the doctrine of mistake. Whether ALCOA assumed the risk it seeks relief from is at issue in this case. The doctrine of assumption of the risk is therefore considered below. The important point to note here is that the doctrine of assumption of the risk is not the only risk allocating limitation on the doctrine of mistake. Other important risk allocating limitations are inherent in the doctrine of mistake itself. They find expression in the cases and treatises in declarations that there has been no mistake, or no legally cognizable mistake, or a mistake of the wrong sort.</p>
<p class="indent">ALCOA claims that there was a mutual mistake about the suitability of the WPI–IC as an index to accomplish the purposes of the parties. Essex replies that the mistake, if any, was not a mistake of <span class="italic">fact,</span> but it was rather a mistake in predicting future economic conditions. Essex asserts that such a mistake does not justify legal relief for ALCOA. The conflicting claims require the Court to resolve three questions: (1) Was the mistake one of “fact” as the cases and commentators use that word? (2) If so, was it of the sort of fact for which relief could be granted? (3) If the mistake was not one of “fact,” is relief necessarily foreclosed?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page778" class="pagebreak">778</div>
<p class="indent">The Court finds the parties’ mistake in this case to be one of fact rather than one of simple prediction of future events. Plainly the mistake is not wholly isolated from predictions of the future or from the searching illuminations of painful hindsight. But this is not the legal test. At the time the contract was made both parties were aware that the future was unknown, and their agreed contract was intended to bind them for many years to come. Both knew that Essex sought an objective pricing formula and that ALCOA sought a formula which would cover its out of pocket costs over the years and which would yield it a return of around four cents a pound. Both parties to the contract carefully examined the past performance of the WPI–IC before agreeing to its use. The testimony was clear that each assumed the Index was adequate to fulfill its purpose. This mistaken assumption was essentially a present actuarial error.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties took pains to avoid the full risk of future economic changes when they embarked on a twenty-one year contract involving services worth hundreds of millions of dollars. To this end they employed a customary business risk limiting device—price indexing—with more than customary sophistication and care. They chose not a single index formula but a complex one with three separate indices….</p>
<p class="indent">The doctrine of mistake has long distinguished claims of mutual mistake from claims of unilateral mistake. The standards for judicial relief are higher where the proven mistake is unilateral than where it is mutual.</p>
<p class="indent">Essex asserts that ALCOA’s mistake was unilateral. Mr. O’Malley, Chairman of the Board of Essex Corporation, testified at trial that he had no particular concern for ALCOA’s well-being and that in the negotiations of the contract he sought only Essex’s best interests. Essex claims this testimony tends to rebut any possible mutual mistake of fact between the parties. The Court disagrees.</p>
<p class="indent">The cases clearly establish that mutual mistake lies in error concerning mutually understood material facts. The law of mutual mistake is not addressed primarily to motivation or to desire to have a good bargain, such as that credibly testified to by Mr. O’Malley. As Mr. O’Malley struck the bargain for Essex, he understood the function of the Wholesale Price Index, as part of the pricing formula, to be the protection of ALCOA from foreseeable economic fluctuations. He further had every reason to believe that the formula was selected on the factual prediction that it would, within tolerable limits, serve its purpose. While he did not share the motive to protect ALCOA, he understood the functional purposes of the agreement. He therefore shared this mistake of fact. And his mistake was Essex’s. The Court recognizes that Mr. O’Malley and Essex would cheerfully live with the benefit of their mistake, but the law provides otherwise. As a matter of law Mr. O’Malley’s testimony of Essex’s indifference concerning ALCOA’s motivation for the use of the Wholesale Price Index as a gauge for tracking non-labor costs is immaterial.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page779" class="pagebreak">779</div>
<p class="indent">Is it enough that one party is indifferent to avoid a mutual mistake? The Court thinks not. This situation resembles that in <span class="italic">Sherwood v. Walker</span>, the celebrated case of Rose of Aberlone. There the owner of a prize breeding cow sold her for slaughter at the going rate for good slaughter cattle. The owner had unsuccessfully tried to breed her and had erroneously concluded she was sterile. In fact she was pregnant at the time of the sale and she was much more valuable for breeding than for slaughter. There as here, the buyer was indifferent to the unknown fact; he would have been pleased to keep the unexpected profit. But he understood the bargain rested on a presumed state of facts. The court let the seller avoid the contract because of mutual mistake of fact.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Sherwood,</span> the buyer didn’t know the highly pedigreed Rose was with calf. He probably could not have discovered it at the time of the sale with due diligence. Here the parties could not possibly have known of the sudden inability of the Wholesale Price Index to reflect ALCOA’s non-labor costs. If, over the previous twenty years, the Wholesale Price Index had tracked, within a 5% variation, pertinent costs to ALCOA, a 500% variation of costs to Index must be deemed to be unforeseeable, within any meaningful sense of the word.</p>
<p class="indent">The Restatements and these cases reveal four facets of risk assumption and risk allocation under the law of mistake. First, a party to a contract may expressly assume a risk. If a contractor agrees to purchase and to remove 114,000 cubic yards of fill from a designated tract for the landowner at a set price “regardless of subsurface soil and water conditions” the contractor assumes the risk that subsurface water may make the removal unexpectedly expensive.</p>
<p class="indent">Customary dealing in a trade or common understanding may lead a court to impose a risk on a party where the contract is silent. Often the result corresponds to the expectation of both parties, but this will not always be true. At times legal rules may form the basis for the inferred common understanding. Equity traditionally put the risk of casualty losses on the purchaser of land while the purchase contract remained executory. This allocation was derived from the doctrine of equitable conversion. “Equity regards as done that which ought to be done.” The rule could always be modified by express agreement. It survives today—where it does survive largely by reason of its acceptance as part of the common expectations of real estate traders and their advisors.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, where neither express words nor some particular common understanding or trade usage dictate a result, the court must allocate the risk in some reasoned way….</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth, where parties enter a contract in a state of conscious ignorance of the facts, they are deemed to risk the burden of having the facts turn out to be adverse, within very broad limits. Each party takes a calculated gamble in such a contract. Because information is often troublesome or costly to obtain, the law does not seek <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page780" class="pagebreak">780</span>to discourage such contracts. Thus if parties agree to sell and purchase a stone which both know may be glass or diamond at a price which in some way reflects their uncertainty, the contract is enforceable whether the stone is in fact glass or diamond. If, by contrast, the parties both mistakenly believe it to be glass, the case is said not to be one of conscious ignorance but one of mutual mistake. Consequently the vendor may void the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case Essex raises two arguments. First, it asserts that ALCOA expressly or by fair implication assumed the risk that the WPI–IC would not keep up with ALCOA’s non-labor production costs. Second, it asserts that the parties made a calculated gamble with full awareness that the future was uncertain, so the contract should be enforced despite the mutual mistake. Both arguments are correct within limits, and within those limits they affect the relief ALCOA may receive. Both arguments fail as complete defenses to ALCOA’s claim.</p>
<p class="indent">Once courts recognize that supposed specific values lie, and are commonly understood to lie, within a penumbra of uncertainty, and that the range of probability is subject to estimation, the principle of conscious uncertainty requires reformulation. The proper question is not simply whether the parties to a contract were conscious of uncertainty with respect to a vital fact, but whether they believe that uncertainty was effectively limited within a designated range so that they would deem outcomes beyond that range to be highly unlikely. In this case the answer is clear. Both parties knew that the use of an objective price index injected a limited range of uncertainty into their projected return on the contract. Both had every reason to predict that the likely range of variation would not exceed three cents per pound. That is to say both would have deemed deviations yielding ALCOA less of a return on its investment, work and risk of less than one cent a pound or of more than seven cents a pound to be highly unlikely. Both consciously undertook a closely calculated risk rather than a limitless one. Their mistake concerning its calculation is thus fundamentally unlike the limitless conscious undertaking of an unknown risk which Essex now posits.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">E.</span></p>
<p class="indent">This leaves the question of framing a remedy for ALCOA. Essex argues that reformation is not available. It cites many Indiana cases declaring that reformation is only available to correct writings which, through mistake, do not reflect the agreement of the parties. The declarations to that effect are clear.</p>
<p class="indent">But the point is immaterial here. This case does not fall within reformation as a traditional head of equity jurisprudence. It does fall within the more general rules of equitable restitution. Courts have traditionally applied three remedial rules in cases of mistake, frustration and impracticability. In some cases courts declare that no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page781" class="pagebreak">781</span>contract ever arose because there was no true agreement between the parties, <span class="italic">Raffles v. Wichelhaus</span>, or because the parties were ignorant of existing facts which frustrated the purpose of one party or made performance impracticable. In some other cases the courts hold that a contract is voidable on one of the three theories. In these cases the customary remedy is rescission. In both classes of cases where one or both parties have performed under the supposed contract, the courts award appropriate restitution in the light of the benefits the parties have conferred on each other. The aim is to prevent unjust enrichment. The courts in such cases often call this remedy “reformation” in the loose sense of “modification.” …</p>
<p class="indent">… To decree rescission in this case would be to grant ALCOA a windfall gain in the current aluminum market. It would at the same time deprive Essex of the assured long term aluminum supply which it obtained under the contract and of the gains it legitimately may enforce within the scope of the risk ALCOA bears under the contract. A remedy which merely shifts the windfall gains and losses is neither required nor permitted by Indiana law.</p>
<p class="indent">To frame an equitable remedy where frustration, impracticability or mistake prevent strict enforcement of a long term executory contract requires a careful examination of the circumstances of the contract, the purposes of the parties, and the circumstances which upset the contract. For some long term executory contracts rescission with or without restitution will be the only sensible remedy. Where developments make performance of the contract economically senseless or purposeless, to modify the contract and to enforce it as modified would be highly inappropriate. But in cases like the present one modification and enforcement may be the only proper remedy. <span class="italic">Parev Products Co. v. I. Rokeach and Sons, Inc.</span> In this case Essex sought an assured long term supply of aluminum at a price which would let it earn a profit on its finished products. ALCOA, facing ordinary market risks in 1967, sought a long term, limited risk use for its Warrick Works. A remedy modifying the price term of the contract in light of the circumstances which upset the price formula will better preserve the purposes and expectations of the parties than any other remedy. Such a remedy is essential to avoid injustice in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">During the trial the parties agreed that a modification of the price term to require Essex to pay ALCOA the ceiling price specified in the contract would be an appropriate remedy if the Court held for ALCOA. The Court understands from the parties that ALCOA will continue to suffer a substantial but smaller out of pocket loss at this price level. But ALCOA has not argued that the ceiling price term is subject to the same basic assumptions about risk limitation as is the indexed price term. Accordingly the Court adopts the ceiling price term as part of the remedy it grants to ALCOA.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court must recognize, though, that before the contract expires economic changes may make this remedy excessively favorable to ALCOA. To deal with that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page782" class="pagebreak">782</span>possibility, the Court must frame a remedy which is suitable to the expectations and to the original agreement of the parties. A price fixed at the contract ceiling could redound to ALCOA’s great profit and to Essex’s great loss in changed circumstances. Therefore the Court adopts the following remedial scheme. For the duration of the contract the price for each pound of aluminum converted by ALCOA shall be the lesser of the current Price A or Price B indicated below.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Price A</span> shall be the contract ceiling price computed periodically as specified in the contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Price B</span> shall be the greater of the current Price B1 or Price B2. <span class="italic">Price B1</span> shall be the price specified in the contract, computed according to the terms of the contract. <span class="italic">Price B2</span> shall be that price which yields ALCOA a profit of one cent per pound of aluminum converted. This will generally yield Essex the benefit of its favorable bargain, and it will reduce ALCOA’s disappointment to the limit of risk the parties expected in making the contract. The profit shall be computed using the same accounting methods used for the production of plaintiff’s exhibit 431. The profit and the resulting price shall be computed once each calendar quarter, as soon after the close of the quarter as the necessary information may be assembled. When Price B2 applies, ALCOA shall bill Essex periodically, as specified in the contract at the price specified at the last quarterly price computation. Essex shall pay those bills according to the payment terms previously observed by the parties. When the next quarterly price computation is completed, that price shall be applied retroactively to the aluminum converted during the previous quarter. ALCOA shall refund any surplus payment by Essex upon the computation of the price or shall bill Essex for any additional money due.</p>
<p class="indent">ALCOA shall keep detailed records of the pertinent costs, indices and computations used to calculate Prices A, B1 and B2 and shall preserve them for two years beyond the termination of the contract. ALCOA shall send Essex, in the manner and at the times specified in the contract, the price information called for in the contract, as well as a quarterly statement of Price B2 whether or not that price then applies. The statement of Price B2 need not specify the elements from which it was calculated.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C<small>ONCLUSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">This case is novel. The sums of money involved are huge. The Court has been considerably aided by the thorough and commendable work of all of the counsel who have participated in the case. There remains a need for a few concluding remarks concerning the theory of Count One of this case and its limitations.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the principal themes in the development of commercial contract doctrines since the 1920’s has been the need for a body of law compatible with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page783" class="pagebreak">783</span>responsible commercial practices and understandings. The old spirit of the law manifest in <span class="italic">Parradine v. Jane</span>, is gone. The new spirit of commercial law in Indiana and elsewhere appears in the Uniform Commercial Code, in new developments of implied covenants, and in the new Restatement.</p>
<p class="indent">At stake in this suit is the future of a commercially important device—the long term contract. Such contracts are common in many fields of commerce. Mineral leases, building and ground leases, and long term coal sales agreements are just three examples of such contracts. If the law refused an appropriate remedy when a prudently drafted long term contract goes badly awry, the risks attending such contracts would increase. Prudent business people would avoid using this sensible business tool. Or they would needlessly suffer the delay and expense of ever more detailed and sophisticated drafting in an attempt to approximate by agreement what the law could readily furnish by general rule.</p>
<p class="indent">Another aspect of the new spirit of commercial law is important in this case. Much of the story of modern business law and of modern management concerns deals with the problem of risk limitation. The development of the concept of limited liability in the modern corporation illustrates this development. So do the proliferation of insurance, the development of no-fault auto insurance, and the recurring analysis of a party’s capacity to anticipate losses and spread them or insure against them. <span class="italic">Force majeur</span> clauses, price indexing agreements and “double net” leases all aim to clarify and to limit the risk of long term contracts. Responsible business managers are attentive to risk control.</p>
<p class="indent">Corporate managers are fiduciaries. Law, founded on good sense, requires them to act with care in the management of businesses owned by other people. Attention to risk limitation is essential to the fiduciary duty of corporate managers. Courts must consider the fiduciary duty of management and the established practice of risk limitation in interpreting contracts and in the application of contract doctrines such as mistake, frustration and impracticability. Corporate managers should not gamble with corporate funds. Generally they do not. Courts should not presume that they do, nor should they frame rules founded on such a presumption. Instead, courts should be alert to indications that the parties to a commercial contract sought to limit their risks, and should interpret the contracts and frame remedies to protect that purpose.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Parev Products Co. v. I. Rokeach &amp; Sons, Inc</span>., decided by Judges Clark, Frank and Learned Hand, illustrated an aspect of this point. There Parev, the plaintiff, by contract gave the defendant the exclusive right to produce and to market its product, Nyafat, a cooking oil, for fifty years for a specified royalty. The defendant had the option to cancel the contract at any time for a fee. The plaintiff agreed not to market the product or any similar product during the contract, and the defendant agreed not to market the product or any similar product after the end of the contract. In <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page784" class="pagebreak">784</span>1939 competitors began to sell Crisco and Spry, white semi-solid cooking oils which reduced the sales of the plaintiff’s oil. The defendant responded to the falling sales by introducing a new product of its own, Kea, similar to Crisco and Spry. The plaintiff sued to enjoin this further competition with its product. Since the express negative covenants did not forbid this competition, the plaintiff argued that the court should imply a negative covenant to forbid it.</p>
<p class="indent">The court rejected the defendant’s argument that only covenants intended by the parties may be implied. The court noted the then traditional “reluctance of courts to admit that they were to a considerable extent ‘remaking’ a contract in situations where it seemed necessary and appropriate to do so.” The court acknowledged that a discernible intent of the parties should control the case, but it found no sufficient indication of intent respecting this problem: [Here the court quotes extensively from <span class="italic">Parev.</span>]</p>
<p class="indent">The court protected the “status” of both parties by implying a term requiring the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for royalties lost due to competition with the defendant’s new product.</p>
<p class="indent">The court gave close attention to the legitimate business aims of the parties, to their purpose of avoiding the risks of great losses, and to the need to frame a remedy to preserve the essence of the agreement. To that extent the decision exemplifies the new spirit of contract law.</p>
<p class="indent">This attitude toward contract law and toward the work of the courts will disturb some people even at this late date. It strains against half-remembered truths and remembered half-truths from the venerated first year course in Contract Law. The core of the trouble lies in the hoary maxim that the courts will not make a contract for the parties. The maxim requires three replies. First, courts today can indeed make contracts for the parties. Given certain minimal indicators of an intent to contract, the courts are today directed to impose on the parties the necessary specific provisions to complete the process. See U.C.C. §§ 2–204, 2–207, 2–208. Second, a distinction has long been noted between judicial imposition of initial terms and judicial interpretations and implications of terms to resolve disputes concerning contracts the parties have made for themselves. The maxim bears less weight when it is applied to dispute resolution than it does when it is applied to questions of contract formation. This case is plainly one of dispute resolution. Third, the maxim rests on two sensible notions: (1) Liability under the law of contract rests on assent, not imposition. (2) Judges are seldom able business men; they seldom have the information, ability, or time to do a good job of contracting for the parties. Neither of these notions applies here. The parties have made their own contract. The Court’s role here is limited to framing a remedy for a problem they did not foresee and provide for. And while the Court willingly concedes that the managements of ALCOA and Essex are better able to conduct their business than is the Court, in this dispute <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page785" class="pagebreak">785</span>the Court has information from hindsight far superior to that which the parties had when they made their contract. The parties may both be better served by an informed judicial decision based on the known circumstances than by a decision wrenched from words of the contract which were not chosen with a prevision of today’s circumstances. The Court gladly concedes that the parties might today evolve a better working arrangement by negotiation than the Court can impose. But they have not done so, and a rule that the Court may not act would have the perverse effect of discouraging the parties from resolving this dispute or future disputes on their own. Only a rule which permits judicial action of the kind the Court has taken in this case will provide a desirable practical incentive for businessmen to negotiate their own resolution to problems which arise in the life of long term contracts.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_148" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-148" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the Court notes that this case presents a problem of the appropriate legal response to problems of inflation. There are many long term contracts extant where inflation has upset the basic equivalence of the agreement. Courts will increasingly have to attend to problems like the present one. Bearing in mind the hazards of premature generalization, the Court would suggest that four factors considered in this decision will likely prove to be of durable importance in deciding whether to modify contracts: (1) the parties’ prevision of the problems which eventually upset the balance of the agreements and their allocation of the associated risks; (2) the parties’ attempts at risk limitation; (3) the existence of severe out of pocket losses and (4) the customs and expectations of the particular business community.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem of inflation is most frequently encountered as a change in the value of money to purchase things of all sorts. Long term fixed price contracts are most apt to be deranged by the process of inflation and are most apt to require judicial remedies. But inflation is not a coherent phenomenon. Prices of different things change at different rates. The record in this case shows clearly that the price of energy-intensive services has increased since 1973 much more rapidly than has the general Wholesale Price Index. An indexed price term in a contract may prevent or minimize the hardship of inflation, but if it fails to do so, as was true in this case, a court should look beyond the fact of the parties’ prevision of the general problem of inflation and should ask if the deviation between the index and the pertinent costs of the parties was adequately foreseen and its risk allocated in the contract. Indexing may speak more forcefully of a general purpose to limit the risks of a long term contract than of the prevision of the specific problem which the parties encounter.</p>
<p class="indent">The existence of severe out of pocket losses should be essential to the award of relief. Inflation will often increase the value of goods so that a seller could sell his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page786" class="pagebreak">786</span>goods for more than the stipulated contract price. This causes the seller disappointment and brings the purchaser a profit. But within a broad range this sort of market risk is assumed by parties to a long term contract. It would probably be highly disruptive to commercial relations and to transaction plans to allow parties to escape their contracts generally on this ground. Only a showing of unusual circumstance strongly suggesting the parties intended to allow the seller an excuse for performing in these circumstances should justify relief. This problem is hardly fanciful. In long term leases the landlord’s principal cost is the value of the land and buildings. These are settled costs fixed before the lease or early in the leasing process. The landlord’s variable costs that are subject to inflation will usually be limited to maintenance, taxes, and utilities. Many leases put some or all of these costs on the lessee. Under these circumstances the landlord may suffer little or no out of pocket loss due to inflation, but he may suffer serious disappointment if his rent receipts fall greatly behind the current rental value of his property. This sort of disappointment seems less serious and relief from it seems more destructive of contract expectations than the disappointment of serious out of pocket losses and the destruction of expectations incident to their relief.</p>
<p class="indent">The limitation of judicial relief to cases where the parties evidence a desire to limit their risks, where one party suffers severe out of pocket losses not adequately foreseen and provided for by the parties seems adequate to prevent a general disruption of commercial life by inflation. This limitation also seems generally compatible with the fair needs and understanding of responsible businessmen. Little more can be asked of the courts in the development of the law.</p>
<p class="indent">The foregoing shall constitute findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). An appropriate Order will issue.</p>
<p id="sec399" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. This case settled on appeal after argument before the Third Circuit but before its decision.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. These parties were locked into the very tight embrace of a seventeen-year contract from which it would be extremely difficult for them to extricate themselves. Their plants, in which each had a very heavy investment, were physically connected. They dealt in a product market with few participants or alternative sources of supply. Neither party could simply cancel the contract, pick up its marbles, and go play somewhere else. Yet most traditional contract remedies give damages on the assumption that a disappointed party after material breach or repudiation will cover in the market for the performance it will not receive from the other side. Judge Teitelbaum’s remedies are unusual, but what were the practical options once he found <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page787" class="pagebreak">787</span>that the original price clause was a result of mistake or had rendered performance impracticable?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The core problem in this case is the price clause designed by ALCOA with the help of an eminent economist who later became Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. As events worked out, that clause was a disaster in dealing with the consequences of the machinations of another potential monopolist, OPEC, and tightening pollution control laws. Was Alan Greenspan at fault for not designing a price clause that would cover every contingency? Instead of suing Essex, should ALCOA have sued Alan Greenspan for its $75 million out of pocket losses (not to mention pain and suffering)? There are limits on what even the wealthiest contracting parties, with the best lawyers and economists, can do to price-in all the contingencies of a long-term and inherently risky deal. Perhaps this is a situation in which the opportunities to realize gains from trade are limited by the inevitable potential of catastrophe arising from unknown future events. Should a court treat such a situation the same way classical contract law deals with a prize cow thought to be sterile who turns out to be with calf?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Dislocation in market prices following the OPEC oil embargo in 1973 was a fertile source of litigation and a reminder of the potential for runaway hyperinflation. Many nations of the world have suffered inflation rates in excess of 1,000% a year that destroy the expectations of contract. Nations faced with that kind of catastrophe look to legislative, non-legal, or revolutionary solutions, rather than judge-made remedies. Judge Teitelbaum struggled heroically to do justice in this one case, but would his approach be much help if a party to every contract in society complained that its obligations had been rendered meaningless by inflation that made the dollar valueless?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Judge Teitlebaum’s opinion provoked a wide range of scholarly comment. Here are two widely divergent reactions:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In <span class="italic">ALCOA</span>, the parties, at the time of contracting, were unable to deal with certain changed circumstances over the duration of a seventeen-year contract. Yet preserving the contract was important to the parties and to third parties dependent upon its performance but not represented in the litigation. Ian Macneil has argued that in situations such as this there are relational norms that the contract should be preserved and conflict harmonized by adjustment. These norms put a high premium upon developing mechanisms for adjustment over time and good faith efforts to adjust in the light of change. Thus, if in an <span class="italic">ALCOA</span>-type case, the court concludes that the disadvantaged party is entitled to “some relief” but not discharge, and the advantaged party has refused to accept a reasonable adjustment in light of risks that the disadvantaged party did not assume, relational theory also supports a court imposed adjustment to preserve <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page788" class="pagebreak">788</span>the contract, to adjust the price and to avoid the twin devils of unbargained-for hardship and unjust enrichment.</p>

Speidel, <span class="italic">The New Spirit of Contract,</span> 2 J.L. &amp; C<small>OM</small>. 193, 208 (1982).<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_149" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-149" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">This is, I believe the only instance in which an American court has claimed power to recast by its own direct order, without some transparent disguise like “reformation” an essential term in an exchange that was still in progress when some unforeseen external event produced major imbalance. This form of “adjustment” to govern the performances not yet rendered is the one recommended by some authors in American law reviews….</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The first reason that I have urged (for me it is a sufficient reason) for judges to abstain from rewriting the contracts of other people is that they are not qualified for such tasks. Nothing in their prior training as lawyers or their experience in directing litigation and giving coherence to its results will qualify them to invent viable new designs for disrupted enterprises, now gone awry, that the persons most concerned had tried to construct but without success. As one able author has contended, judges trained as judges, are “institutionally incapable” of achieving success in such undertakings.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The second reason, however, is important enough to be stated first for it raises an issue that I regard as a major issue of civil liberty. The question that I have repeatedly raised but have not tried to answer is the question—when an unforeseen event has so drastically altered a contract that the parties to it are fully excused from its further performance, from what source does any court derive the power to impose on them a new contract without the free assent of both? Where rescission is awarded on any of the standard grounds—fraud, mistake, substantial breach, defective capacity, duress—no one has ever suggested that such a power lay hidden somewhere. For myself, I do not propose to spend time looking for the source of the power. I am convinced that it does not exist.</p>

<p class="indent">Labeling a contract term as a promise or condition is primarily a statement of the consequence of nonoccurrence—damages or suspension of the obligation of counter-performances. This is a nice way of saying that the definition is tautological: A promised event is a promise because its non-occurrence constitutes a breach of promise affording the injured party a right to damages, while a condition is a condition because its failure excuses counter-performance. As Holmes teaches in the quotation at the end of this Note, “You can always imply a condition in a contract. But why do you imply it?”</p>
<p class="indent">Consider again the hypothetical agreement between Seller and Buyer at the beginning of this Chapter that illustrated the basic contract structure. Seller agreed to sell and deliver to Buyer’s grain elevator 2,000 bushels of wheat (1,000 by September 10 and 1,000 by October 10). What if, come September 10, Seller delivers 990 bushels instead of the required 1,000? Or what if it delivers 1,000 bushels but delivers a day late? In either event, unless it has a legal excuse, Seller has breached the contract; Buyer has a remedial claim. But is Seller’s breach <span class="bold"><span class="italic">material</span></span>, permitting Buyer to reject the shipment and abandon its own performance? Or must Buyer pay, accept the second shipment, and be satisfied with a claim for the shortage or the delay in the first shipment? The answer, we can say with confidence, depends on whether exact or literal performance by Seller is a condition of Buyer’s promise to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page790" class="pagebreak">790</span>pay. If it is, the failure of Seller’s performance may be variously described as a material breach, total breach, or failure of consideration. But if exact amount or specific completion date is “merely” a promise and not a condition of Buyer’s promised payment, Seller’s failure to perform exactly as promised will be variously described as an immaterial breach, partial breach, or partial failure of consideration. But how helpful is that in deciding which it is?</p>
<p class="indent">The vocabulary in this area is needlessly confusing. Courts use a wide variety of terms to describe breaches of mere promises on the one hand and failures of promissory conditions on the other:</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Independent Promise and Dependent Promise:</span> An independent promise is one whose performance is required even though a promised counter-performance is not rendered. In other words, breach of the counter-promise is merely a breach of promise and not a breach of a promissory condition. A dependent promise, on the other hand, is one which need not be performed if the counter-promise on which it is deemed to be dependent is not performed. Breach of the counter-promise, in other words, is a breach of a promissory condition.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Mere Covenant:</span> This is just another history-laden way of saying mere promise, that is, not a promissory condition.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Immaterial Breach, Partial Breach, Partial Failure of Consideration:</span> Breach of promise but not the nonoccurrence of a condition, that is, this event gives rise only to damages.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Material Breach, Total Breach, Failure of Consideration:</span> Failure of promissory condition, the result of which is both a breach giving rise to damages and failure of a condition, excusing counter-performance.</p>
<p class="indent">These terms are essential parts of the lawyer’s vocabulary (hence you should learn them), but always remember that they are only labels assigned to determinations <span class="bold"><span class="italic">after</span></span> they have been made; you will find them of no help in deciding what the effect of an event should be. Despite the logical form in which the question is often put, the effect of a breach on a promised counter-performance is decided on the basis of context and an assessment of the relative importance of various performances. And this assessment presents a lawyer with some agonizing decisions in counseling clients.</p>
<p class="indent">As Justice Holmes put it in <span class="italic">The Path of the Law</span>, 10 H<small>ARV</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 457 (1897):</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The training of lawyers is a training in logic. The processes of analogy, discrimination, and deduction are those in which they are most at home. The language of judicial decision is mainly the language of logic. And the logical method and form flatter the longing for certainty and for repose which is in every human mind. But certainty generally is illusion and repose is not the destiny of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page791" class="pagebreak">791</span>man. Behind the logical form lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds, of an inarticulate and unconscious judgment it is true, and yet the root and nerve of the whole proceeding. You can give any conclusion a logical form. You can always imply a condition in a contract. But why do you imply it? It is because of some belief as to the practice of the community or of a class, or because of some attitude of yours upon a matter not capable of exact quantitative measurement, and therefore not capable of founding exact logical conclusions. Such matters really are battlegrounds where the means do not exist for determinations that shall be good for all time, and where the decision can do no more than embody the preference of a given body in a given time and place.</p>
<h4 id="sec402" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">B.   T<small>HE</small> E<small>VALUATION OF</small> N<small>ONPERFORMANCE</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">The effect of a particular nonperformance on the continuing relationship of the parties may include two aspects: damages and the suspension or termination of the promisee’s performance obligations. If the nonperformance is not very important, it will not disturb the promisee’s security as to eventual performance, and therefore it is unlikely to suspend the obligation of counter-performance. After minor nonperformance, the disappointed party can be left to its remedy in damages, if any have been suffered. More serious breaches, however, will not only produce damages, but also threaten the security of the relationship. The disappointed party’s duty of counterperformance is at least suspended until performance is assured.</p>
<p class="indent">If a delivery arrives an hour late, for instance, that is a breach, and the disappointed Buyer can recover damages if it has suffered any. During that hour of delay, Buyer’s obligations to pay probably are suspended. But absent unusual circumstances that would make the delay of overriding significance, it is unlikely that Buyer is permanently excused or that the contract is terminated. When the goods arrive, Buyer must take and pay for them. Seen this way, the operative legal questions are (a) does the nonperformance justify the suspension of counter-performance and (b) is the nonperformance sufficiently serious to consider the contract terminated by the failure of performance. Obviously, only a serious or aggravated breach will threaten the existence of the relationship.</p>

The agreement is in writing and is termed a “rental agreement.” It specifies in part that:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">The lessor agrees to construct and install, at its own cost, one 18’9" high x 8’8" wide pylon type d.f. neon sign with electric clock and flashing lamps * * *. The lessor agrees to and does hereby lease or rent unto the said lessee the said SIGN for the term, use and rental and under the conditions, hereinafter set out, and the lessee agrees to pay said rental * * *.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">(a) The term of this lease shall be 36 months * * *.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">(b) The rental to be paid by lessee shall be $148.50 per month for each and every calendar month during the term of this lease; * * *.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">(c) <span class="italic">Maintenance.</span> Lessor at its expense agrees to maintain and service the sign together with such equipment as supplied and installed by the lessor to operate in conjunction with said sign under the terms of this lease; this service is to include cleaning and repainting of sign in original color scheme as often as deemed necessary by lessor to keep sign in first class advertising condition and make all necessary repairs to sign and equipment installed by lessor. * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">At the “expiration of this agreement,” it was also provided, “title to this sign reverts to lessee.” This clause is in addition to the printed form of agreement and was apparently added as a result of defendants’ concern over title, they having expressed a desire “to buy for cash” and the salesman, at one time, having “quoted a cash price.”</p>
<p class="indent">The sign was completed and installed in the latter part of July, 1953. The first billing of the monthly payment of $148.50 was made August 1, 1953, with payment thereof by defendants on September 3, 1953. This first payment was also the last. Shortly after the sign was installed, someone hit it with a tomato. Rust, also, was visible on the chrome, complained defendants, and in its corners were “little spider cobwebs.” In addition, there were “some children’s sayings written down in here.” Defendant Herbert Harrison called Walker for the maintenance he believed himself entitled to under subparagraph (c) above. It was not forthcoming. He called again and again. “I was getting, you might say, sorer and sorer. * * * Occasionally, when I started calling up, I would walk around where the tomato was and get mad again. Then I would call up on the phone again.” Finally, on October 8, 1953, plaintiff not having responded to his repeated calls, he telegraphed Walker that:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page794" class="pagebreak">794</div>
<p class="blockquote_inds">“You Have Continually Voided Our Rental Contract By Not Maintaining Signs As Agreed As We No Longer Have A Contract With You Do Not Expect Any Further Remuneration.”</p>
<p class="indent">Walker’s reply was in the form of a letter. After first pointing out that “your telegram does not make any specific allegations as to what the failure of maintenance comprises,” and stating that “We certainly would appreciate your furnishing us with such information,” the letter makes reference to a prior collateral controversy between the parties, “wondering if this refusal on our part prompted your attempt to void our rental contract,” and concludes as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">We would like to call your attention to paragraph G in our rental contract, which covers procedures in the event of a Breach of Agreement. In the event that you carry out your threat to make no future monthly payments in accordance with the agreement, it is our intention to enforce the conditions outlined under paragraph G through the proper legal channels. We call to your attention that your monthly rental payments are due in advance at our office not later than the 10th day of each current month. You are now approximately 30 days in arrears on your September payment. Unless we receive both the September and October payments by October 25th, this entire matter will be placed in the hands of our attorney for collection in accordance with paragraph G which stipulates that the entire amount is forthwith due and payable.</p>
<p class="indent">No additional payments were made and Walker sued in assumpsit for the entire balance due under the contract, $5,197.50, invoking paragraph (g) of the agreement. Defendants filed answer and claim of recoupment, asserting that plaintiff’s failure to perform certain maintenance services constituted a prior material breach of the agreement, thus justifying their repudiation of the contract and grounding their claim for damages. The case was tried to the court without a jury and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff. The case is before us on a general appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants urge upon us again and again, in various forms, the proposition that Walker’s failure to service the sign, in response to repeated requests, constituted a material breach of the contract and justified repudiation by them. Their legal proposition is undoubtedly correct. Repudiation is one of the weapons available to an injured party in event the other contractor has committed a material breach. But the injured party’s determination that there has been a material breach, justifying his own repudiation, is fraught with peril, for should such determination, as viewed by a later court in the calm of its contemplation, be unwarranted, the repudiator himself will have been guilty of material breach and himself have become the aggressor, not an innocent victim.</p>
<p class="indent">What is our criterion for determining whether or not a breach of contract is so fatal to the undertaking of the parties that it is to be classed as “material”? There is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page795" class="pagebreak">795</span>no single touchstone. Many factors are involved. They are well stated in [the first Restatement of Contracts] section 275 in the following terms:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In determining the materiality of a failure fully to perform a promise the following circumstances are influential:</p>
<p class="blockquote">(a) The extent to which the injured party will obtain the substantial benefit which he could have reasonably anticipated;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(b) The extent to which the injured party may be adequately compensated in damages for lack of complete performance;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(c) The extent to which the party failing to perform has already partly performed or made preparations for performance;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(d) The greater or less hardship on the party failing to perform in terminating the contract;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(e) The wilful, negligent or innocent behavior of the party failing to perform;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(f) The greater or less uncertainty that the party failing to perform will perform the remainder of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">We will not set forth in detail the testimony offered concerning the need for servicing. Granting that Walker’s delay (about a week after defendant Herbert Harrison sent his telegram of repudiation Walker sent out a crew and took care of things) in rendering the service requested was irritating, we are constrained to agree with the trial court that it was not of such materiality as to justify repudiation of the contract, and we are particularly mindful of the lack of preponderant evidence contrary to his determination. The trial court, on this phase of the case, held as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Now Mr. Harrison phoned in, so he testified, a number of times. He isn’t sure of the dates but he sets the first call at about the 7th of August and he complained then of the tomato and of some rust and some cobwebs. The tomato, according to the testimony, was up on the clock; that would be outside of his reach, without a stepladder or something. The cobwebs are within easy reach of Mr. Harrison and so would the rust be. I think that Mr. Bueche’s argument that these were not materially a breach would clearly be true as to the cobwebs and I really can’t believe in the face of all the testimony that there was a great deal of rust seven days after the installation of this sign. And that really brings it down to the tomato. And, of course, when a tomato has been splashed all over your clock, you don’t like it. But he says he kept calling their attention to it, although the rain probably washed some of the tomato off. But the stain remained, and they didn’t come. I really can’t find that that was such a material breach of the contract as to justify rescission. I really don’t think so.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page796" class="pagebreak">796</div>
<p class="indent">Nor, we conclude, do we. There was no valid ground for defendants’ repudiation and their failure thereafter to comply with the terms of the contract was itself a material breach, entitling Walker, upon this record, to judgment.</p>
<p id="sec405" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Was it a breach for Walker not to come when Harrison called the first time? How about the second time Harrison called?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If it was a breach for Walker not to respond, what would Harrison’s damages be? Would Harrison be entitled to any other remedies?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Why would Harrison buy the sign in the first place? If people laughed because this dry cleaner’s shop had a sign with a tomato stain on its clock, would Harrison be getting the substantial benefit he reasonably anticipated from the contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Does the fact that it would take Harrison only three minutes to clean off the sign himself affect your decision whether Walker’s failure to come was a material breach?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Should Walker &amp; Co.’s damages be offset by its savings from not having to service the sign for the three-year term of the lease?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. If Harrison came to you for advice on August 7, what would you tell him? If he came to you on September 3, when the next rent check was due, what would you advise him to do? If he came to you on October 8, before the telegram was sent, what advice would you give? If he came to you after receiving Walker’s letter, what would you say?</p>
<h4 id="sec406" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">C.   S<small>ITUATION</small> T<small>YPES OF</small> N<small>ONPERFORMANCE</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">No simple rules predict the legal consequence of every conceivable breach, but common breach situations do usually fall into identifiable patterns. Most partial failures in performance are of two types: (i) late performances and (ii) defective performances that vary in quality or quantity from what the contract calls for. Late performances, in turn, fall into two subcategories: failure to make timely payment of money and failure to timely deliver goods or services. There is a practical difference in the treatment courts give these two subcategories: late payment is less likely to be a material breach than late delivery of goods or services.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page797" class="pagebreak">797</div>
<h5 id="sec407" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">1. Late Performance: Payment</span></h5>
<p class="indent">The practical and important issue when parties fix payment terms is who is going to extend how much credit in the deal—the buyer, the seller, both, or neither. Payment may be due at some time after the delivery date of the goods or other bargained-for counterperformance or in installments. Such arrangements are common in our credit-dominated society. If payment is due after delivery, late payment forces the Seller to accept delayed repayment of the credit extended under the terms of the contract. The late paying buyer is, in effect, merely extending the due date of a loan involuntarily. But this is so common in today’s economy that we tend to feel that payment exactly on time is not of great consequence so long as the buyer pays interest, the delay is not too great, and the debt is eventually paid in full.</p>
<p class="indent">One sense in which late payment is less disruptive than late delivery of goods is that the loss can be easily computed since the seller’s loss and its compensation in damages are in the same medium: money. Moreover consequential damages or lost mitigation opportunities do not figure prominently in late payment cases though they may in the late delivery context. Unless the disappointed seller lacks sufficient capital or credit, it can be made whole by damages measured simply by the going interest rate. Hence, the seller who insists on immediate termination because of late payment is suspect unless the buyer is in serious financial trouble.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes payment is required at the time of delivery (cash-on-delivery or “COD” terms); sometimes a contract requires a downpayment or full prepayment prior to delivery. If a delay in payment is treated as a minor or immaterial breach even in these cases Seller might be obligated to deliver on credit even though it specifically bargained not to bear that credit risk. Generally the law’s solution is simple: Seller is not so obligated. Seller can suspend its performance and wait for payment before further delivery. But how long must seller wait—or how many delayed payments must it tolerate—before it can terminate its contract obligation because payment is late?</p>

<p id="sec408" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Foundation Dev. Corp. v. Loehmann’s</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Supreme Court of Arizona, 1990.</p>
<p class="sectionb">163 Ariz. 438, 788 P.2d 1189.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ F<small>ELDMAN</small>, V<small>ICE</small> C<small>HIEF</small> J<small>USTICE</small>. Loehmann’s, Inc. (Loehmann’s) petitions us to review a court of appeals opinion dealing with grounds for termination of a long-term commercial lease. The trial court ruled that Loehmann’s delay in paying a common area charge was a trivial breach of its lease and therefore refused to permit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page798" class="pagebreak">798</span>the landlord, Foundation Development Corporation (Foundation), to re-enter and take possession of the leased premises. The court of appeals reversed….</p>
<p class="indent">In 1978, Loehmann’s became the anchor tenant in the Lincoln View Plaza Shopping Center by entering into a twenty-year lease with Foundation’s predecessor in interest. The lease contained no provision for percentage rental or rental increase during the twenty-year term. Loehmann’s had an option to renew for two five-year terms. The lease therefore was potentially of thirty years’ duration, expiring in 2008. Loehmann’s was to operate a retail clothing store, part of its nationwide chain.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to rental payments due on the first day of each month, Loehmann’s was liable for common area charges based on its proportionate share of the total square footage in the shopping complex. Loehmann’s customary practice was to make estimated partial payments for the common area charges at the end of each of the first three quarters of each lease year. At the end of the fourth quarter, Foundation submitted an adjusted statement itemizing its actual expenditures for the year. Loehmann’s then paid the difference between the partial payments it had made and the total actual expenditures, generally paying thirty days or longer after it received the statement. Loehmann’s total annual payments to Foundation were approximately $50,000 ($45,000 annual rent plus approximately $5,000 for common area charges).</p>
<p class="indent">The lease also contained a section describing “Conditions of Default.” If Loehmann’s failed “to pay any installment of minimum annual rental or additional rental or other charges [and did not cure] within ten (10) days after receipt * * * of notice of such neglect or failure,” Foundation could “prior to the removal of such Condition of Default,” elect to terminate the lease. The lease stipulated that “with respect to * * * [Loehmann’s] obligation to pay rent, taxes and other charges * * * [or] in any case where either party * * * is required to do any act, the time for the performance thereof shall be of the essence.”</p>
<p class="indent">On February 23, 1987, Geri Beemiller (Beemiller), an employee of Foundation’s local managing agent, Rae–Marc Asset Management (Rae–Marc), sent Loehmann’s the year-end statement for common area charges for the lease year ending January 31, 1987. The statement was addressed to Kevin Gaw (Gaw) at Loehmann’s Halsey Street address in New York. The balance due was $3,566.44. The statement did not indicate when payment was due, and Beemiller indicated that if Gaw had any questions, he should contact her. The lease had no provision indicating a time schedule for the payment of the fourth installment of the common area charge.</p>
<p class="indent">Believing that Foundation had miscalculated its proration of the total square footage of the complex, Gaw sent an inquiry to Beemiller on March 18, 1987. Beemiller responded to the Halsey Street address on March 25, 1987, indicating that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page799" class="pagebreak">799</span>because a portion of the complex had been sold, Loehmann’s proportionate share of the total had been increased.</p>
<p class="indent">On April 10, 1987, Timothy Richardson, another Rae–Marc employee in Phoenix, sent a demand letter to Loehmann’s. He referred to the original February 23, 1987 statement (erroneously noting that it covered the period ending March 31, 1987 and not January 31), and appended it, but did not mention Gaw’s recent inquiry to Beemiller or the latter’s response. He addressed the letter to Loehmann’s at the leased premises in Phoenix and at the address listed on the lease on Baychester Avenue, New York. He copied the letter to the Halsey Street address. Richardson did not address the letter to a specific individual. He further stated: “We have not yet received your payment in the amount of $3,566.44. We must reinstate time of the essence of your lease and insist that this amount be paid within ten days from the date of this letter.”</p>
<p class="indent">Loehmann’s received Richardson’s letter in the Phoenix store on April 13, 1987. Because the local store was not responsible for paying rent or other charges, the letter was forwarded to the Halsey Street office. The letter sent to the Baychester Avenue address was returned to Foundation, presumably because Loehmann’s no longer occupied that building.</p>
<p class="indent">Loehmann’s Halsey Street office received the letter on Friday, April 17, 1987. Apparently because the letter was not addressed to any particular individual, the mail room personnel sent it to Loehmann’s general counsel, Marvin Gardner. Mr. Gardner was not in his office that Friday, which Loehmann’s notes was Good Friday. When he returned to work on Monday April 20, 1987, he sent the notice to the accounting department. A senior staff accountant marked the letter “REC’D 4–20–</p>
<p class="indent">87.” The accountant approved the original statement for common area charges on April 22, 1987 by affixing his initials, and noting the date and the store number. On Friday April 24, 1987 a check was issued. Loehmann’s claims the check was mailed the next day, April 25. On Tuesday April 28, 1987, Foundation filed a complaint in superior court seeking termination of the lease, immediate possession of the leased premises, and payment of the accrued common area charges. A day later, April 29, Foundation received Loehmann’s check in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">A. The Historical Perspective</span></p>
<p class="indent">The landlord-tenant relationship had its genesis in feudal England. Most land was held through a personal relationship between a tenant and his lord, the tenant expecting to hold for a lifetime, the lord expecting to dispose of the holding as he pleased after the tenant died. As the concept of a tenancy for years first developed, the law regarded the tenant as having only contract rights. Courts, however, gradually became aware that mere contractual remedies did not protect the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment of the property. By 1235, the development of the writ <span class="italic">quare ejecit</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page800" class="pagebreak">800</span><span class="italic">infra terminum</span> gave the tenant a remedy against those who took from the original landowner, and by the fifteenth century, the writ <span class="italic">de ejectione firmae</span> afforded him protection against third parties, not only those claiming through his landlord. The law clearly recognized that the tenant had an important property right in the leasehold that transcended his contractual relationship with the landlord.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, because of its historical underpinnings, landlord-tenant law is infused with principles of both real property and contract law. Therefore, although logically and analytically it is correct to say that a lease is both a conveyance and a contract, the modern law traditionally viewed it as a conveyance.</p>
<p class="indent">An important consequence of recognizing a lease as a conveyance was that when contract law developed the concept of dependency of covenants and thus permitted the equitable remedy of rescission upon breach, landlords and tenants did not share in this remedy. Consequently, in the absence of a statute or lease clause authorizing it, neither landlord nor tenant was empowered to terminate a leasehold because of the other’s breach, and violation of a lease covenant gave rise only to an action for the damages caused by the breach. Thus, at common law a landlord could not dispossess a tenant who failed to keep his promise to pay rent, and had to be satisfied with damages for the breach.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, even if the lease specifically gave the landlord the equitable remedy of rescission—the right to re-enter and terminate for non-payment of rent—the Court of Chancery would prevent forfeiture upon payment of the rent in arrears and costs. The court provided relief based “upon the notion that such condition and forfeiture [were] intended merely as security for payment of money.” Such lease provisions were not intended to enable the landlord to obtain undue advantage of a tenant on technical and inequitable grounds. Nor were they designed to destroy the landlord-tenant relationship for “slight reason.” Of course, general equitable principles applied in such situations. For the court to grant relief, the tenant must have dealt fairly and must have made an honest attempt to comply with the provisions of the lease.</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, the common law traditionally sought to stabilize and maintain the landlord-tenant relationship in cases where breach had occurred. Should a different rule obtain when a landlord seeks forfeiture pursuant to statute?</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">B. Arizona: Statute, Lease Provision, and Case Law</span></p>
<p class="indent">In Arizona, A.R.S. § 33–361(A) confers the right of re-entry and termination to the landlord for the violation of a commercial lease. The precursor to this statute became law in 1895. Presumably, the legislature responded to burgeoning business interests in the territory by affording the landlord a right of rescission. The statute states in pertinent part that: “* * * [w]hen a tenant neglects or refuses to pay rent when due and in arrears for five days, or when tenant violates any provision of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page801" class="pagebreak">801</span>lease, the landlord * * * may re-enter and take possession, or without formal demand or re-entry, commence an action for recovery of possession of the premises.”</p>
<p class="indent">We join Foundation in reading the statute as expressing a legislative intent to confer on the landlord a right to terminate for breach, a right not possessed at common law in 1895 absent a contractual provision. We do not, however, necessarily read it so broadly as Foundation urges—to express a legislative intent that any breach, at any time, of “any provision” would give the landlord the right to forfeit the leasehold.</p>
<p class="indent">Foundation argues, however, that so long as the lease provides that violation of a covenant is grounds for termination, the court must enforce the lease according to its terms. It also contends that because the lease provides for forfeiture and A.R.S. § 33–361(A) permits the landlord to “re-enter and take possession” for “violation of any provision of the lease,” the trial court has no discretion regarding the enforcement of the forfeiture.</p>
<p class="indent">In claiming A.R.S. § 33–361 prevents judicial consideration of equitable defenses to forfeiture of Loehmann’s leasehold interest, Foundation ignores the important interplay of property and contract law that preceded the enactment of the statute. The property rights concept—that a lease was a conveyance—was essential to maintain economic equilibrium in an agrarian environment. The fact that leasehold interests now prevail in the urban, business world does not diminish their importance. Commercial tenants often make substantial investments for fixtures or for improvements to the leasehold. They hire personnel and enter into agreements (often long term) to foster the continuation of their enterprise based on the expectation that they will be able to conduct their business for the term they have leased the property. Sound public policy reasons militate in favor of assuring the stability of such economic relationships. Accordingly, absent some express statement of legislative intent, we are hesitant to believe that, in enacting A.R.S. § 33–361, the legislature intended to permit forfeitures under any and all circumstances, no matter how trivial, inadvertent, non-prejudicial, or technical the breach.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no basis suggested for applying a different rule for a trivial or immaterial breach. By enacting A.R.S. § 33–361, the legislature effected a change in the operation of the common law: the landlord could seek to terminate a lease for a tenant’s breach even in the absence of a lease provision conferring that right. Generally, we strictly construe statutes that are in derogation of the common law. While we will uphold a forfeiture when the breach is significant, we do not believe we should so literally construe A.R.S. § 33–361 as to enable a landlord to obtain an undue advantage over his tenant by permitting forfeiture for every or any breach, no matter how trivial or technical. Given the history briefly outlined above, we believe the legislative interest in enacting the predecessor of § 33–361(A) was merely to give the lessor a right not recognized at common law—the right to terminate in the absence <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page802" class="pagebreak">802</span>of a contractual provision. We do not believe the legislature intended to enact the dangerous doctrine that forfeiture was to be permitted for any breach no matter how inconsequential.</p>
<p class="indent">Having been squarely presented with the question for the first time, we decline to hold that any breach, no matter how trivial or insignificant, can justify a forfeiture. Nor do we believe such a rule could long survive. Trivial or not, the delay in paying the rent here was at most three days. What if the breach had been three hours instead of three days or the check had been lost in the mail and came at three minutes after midnight? The questions almost answer themselves. Therefore, we now join the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that hold the landlord’s right to terminate is not unlimited. We believe a court’s decision to permit termination must be tempered by notions of equity and common sense. We thus hold a forfeiture for a trivial or immaterial breach of a commercial lease should not be enforced. Accordingly, we turn to analyze whether Loehmann’s breach—a three-day delay in payment—was of such dimension so as to permit forfeiture.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">D. The Standard for Evaluating the Triviality of a Breach</span></p>
<p class="indent">We agree with Foundation that the payment of the common area charge, is a material provision of the lease. Nonetheless, we believe a material provision of a lease may be breached in such a trivial manner that to enforce a forfeiture would be unconscionable and inequitable.</p>
<p class="indent">Courts often conclude a party has breached a lease provision in a material as opposed to trivial or immaterial manner based only on the specific facts at issue. They therefore do not identify a workable standard to evaluate the triviality of a breach. The Restatement (Second) of Property § 13.1 provides that if a tenant fails to perform a valid promise contained in the lease, the landlord may terminate if he “is deprived of a significant inducement to the making of the lease and the tenant does not perform his promise within a reasonable period of time after being requested to do so.” We find this statement too general to be very helpful; we believe the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_151" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-151" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span></sup> sets forth a more explicit analytical framework. It requires the factfinder to consider the following:</p>
<p class="blockquote">(a) the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page803" class="pagebreak">803</div>
<p class="blockquote">(b) the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated [by damages] for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(c) the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances;</p>
<p class="blockquote">(e) the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.</p>
<p class="indent">We adopt these standards for determining the triviality or immateriality of a breach in the landlord-tenant context. We turn, then, to review the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in Loehmann’s favor. In doing so, we consider the facts in a light most favorable to Foundation. Applying the Restatement (Second) of Contracts standard to the facts of this case, did the trial court err in finding the breach to be trivial?</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">E. Was the Breach Trivial in this Case?</span></p>
<p class="indent">The court determined that if the date of the receipt of the letter at Loehmann’s store, April 13, 1987, initiated the time to pay or cure, the payment made on April 25, 1987 was two days late. Therefore, as to subsections (a) and (b) supra, Foundation at most would be deprived of the benefit of its bargain only in the loss of the use of the funds for two days. Foundation makes no claim that it was damaged by the delay in payment. Furthermore, it may be adequately compensated by a judgment of damages for any loss of interest on the funds it incurred in those two days.</p>
<p class="indent">In applying subsection (c) of the Restatement standards, the factfinder should consider the extent to which the party failing to perform or to make an offer to perform will suffer forfeiture if the failure is treated as material. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 comment d. In the general contract setting, a failure to perform will not be deemed material if it occurs “late, after [the breaching party’s] substantial preparation or performance.” In the present case, the trial court found: “Given the magnitude of this lease, the obvious value of the property and the lease, the approximate amount of money annually due under the lease and the history of the performance under the lease, the Court finds the breach in this case to be trivial * * *.”</p>
<p class="indent">The facts in the record regarding the tenant’s investment (preparation), the tenant’s lack of history as to previous breach during almost ten years of occupancy (performance), and the size of the breach relative to the entire amount of money annually due, support the trial judge’s finding that this breach was trivial. As for subsection (d), Loehmann’s has already cured its failure to perform and never indicated it was unwilling to do so.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page804" class="pagebreak">804</div>
<p class="indent">Additionally, Loehmann’s behavior comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing. The breach was not willful or persistent. The fact that the breach occurred at all was arguably due to Loehmann’s belief that the time for payment was initiated upon its receipt of the demand letter and statement at the Halsey Street address in New York, not the store address in Phoenix. Furthermore, the demand letter was not addressed to a particular individual, while the previous statements and correspondence were addressed to Gaw. Lastly, the letter did not reference the previous correspondence regarding the disputed amount and in fact misstated the time period the statement covered. The fact that Loehmann’s personnel engaged in responsible business practices by insuring that the payment was indeed due and the amount correct certainly does not indicate bad faith or a desire not to comply with the request for payment. The trial court’s implicit finding that Loehmann’s dealt in good faith and made an honest attempt to comply with the provisions of the lease is well supported in the record.</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case, the lease did not provide a specific due date for the payment of the common area charges. Loehmann’s had paid the entire annual rent and approximately fifty to seventy-five percent of the common area charge amount due and had reasonable questions about the accuracy of the final account. While Loehmann’s customary practice was to pay the final common area charge in thirty days or longer, Foundation sent its demand letter—addressed to no particular individual—only sixteen days after its agent had explained the assessment and had verified that the statement was correct. Foundation did not allege that Loehmann’s had been an uncooperative tenant in any other respect or that it had indicated it was not ready, able and willing to make payment. In response to a question at oral argument as to why Foundation did not simply telephone Loehmann’s to inquire as to the status of the payment, Foundation responded only that it had the right to enforce the lease as written.</p>
<p class="indent">Having determined that the trial court did not err in holding the breach at issue was so trivial that to enforce a forfeiture would be unjust, we must turn to Foundation’s final argument: does the time of the essence clause render a trivial breach material?</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">F. The Time of the Essence Clause</span></p>
<p class="indent">Foundation urges us to sustain the court of appeals holding that the time of the essence provision of the lease, reinstated by the demand letter, had the effect of rendering an otherwise trivial breach, by untimely performance, material….</p>
<p class="indent">Professor Corbin refutes the statement that common law judges rigidly adhered to the rule that “time is of the essence” in all contracts at common law, explaining that to determine if untimely performance is a material breach, there must be weighing “of the importance of many factors in each particular case.” Even if the parties <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page805" class="pagebreak">805</span>include a time of the essence provision, “[i]f the enforcement of such an express provision will have the effect of enforcing an excessive penalty or an unjust forfeiture, equity will prevent such enforcement.”</p>
<p class="indent">We believe we would be hard pressed to discover a commercial lease that did not include the condition that “time is of the essence” for payment of rent or other charges. Considering such provisions may be more appropriately included in contracts for the sale of goods where a party’s performance may be conditioned on the promisor’s timely performance, it is questionable whether such “stock phrases” add much to the parties’ obligations in cases such as this. We do not write such words out of every contract. In contracts between a vendor and purchaser, a purchaser’s failure to make timely payment may be held to go to the essence and justify the seller in refusing to convey if values are rapidly fluctuating and because of the delay the purchaser would profit by the transaction. Similarly, timely conveyance may be of the essence when a vendor is aware a buyer intends to continue a business that is already a going concern or make improvements and start a new business.</p>
<p class="indent">If failure of payment at the exact time will not cause injury, time cannot be absolutely “of the essence,” even though, technically, delay will be a breach. The inquiry must always involve the facts of the individual case and the effect of the breach on the injured party.</p>
<p class="indent">We thus hold that a time of the essence provision is merely one factor to be considered when determining if a breach is material. The mere incantation that “time is of the essence” works no magic to transform trivial untimeliness into a material breach; rather, the same factors we delineated in determining general materiality apply to evaluating the effect of a particular “time of the essence” provision.</p>
<p id="sec409" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. This case involved a long-term lease implicating substantial commercial interests between sophisticated parties. The Arizona Supreme Court, in affirming the trial court’s refusal to declare the breach material, must address the Arizona statute and the contractual “time of the essence” condition in the lease. The court applies traditional concepts in narrowly reading the statute, which operates in derogation of the common law, in order to avoid a forfeiture of the tenant’s leasehold. This analysis may provide an adequate basis for interpreting the statute as exempting minor breaches. But on what basis does the court limit the contractual “time of the essence” clause? After all, these sophisticated parties had lawyers who drafted an elaborate lease and can be presumed to have meant what they said.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What would be the consequence of finding this breach material? What economic loss would be realized by the breaching tenant? What loss was realized by the landlord from the breach?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page806" class="pagebreak">806</div>
<p class="indent">3. In <span class="italic">Mining Investment Group LLC v. Roberts</span>, 177 P.3d 1207 (Ariz.App. 2008), the court distinguished <span class="italic">Loehmann’s</span> in a case involved a sale of real estate rather than a long-term lease. The parties had agreed that the sale would close on October 14. The buyer was required to come up with $30,000 to close the transaction. The sellers arrived at the escrow office at 1 pm and waited for two hours for confirmation of receipt of the wire. No wire was received that day and at 5:30 pm the sellers faxed a letter to the buyer terminating the sale contract. The seller also kept the buyer’s $10,000 deposit as liquidated damages. The buyer’s wire came through the next business day, but the seller refused to accept it having terminated the sale contract at the close of business on the scheduled closing date. The court noting that the contract expressly provided that the failure to close by October 14 would be material breach entitling the seller to cancel the agreement and retain the deposit. It enforced the agreement as written, notwithstanding the buyer’s resulting forfeiture of both its deposit and any equitable interest in the land. Right result? Different from <span class="italic">Loehmann’s</span> or not? If so why?</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec410" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">2. Late Performance: Delivery</span></h5>
<p class="indent">Damages for late payment are usually easy to compute and recover, but the opposite is the case where the delay is in delivery of product or services. Conversion of loss for late delivery into money recovery is apt to be very difficult. Recall the difficulty the shipper in <span class="italic">Hadley v. Baxendale</span>, p. 160, had in recovering for the late delivery of his millshaft. In short, the definition of contract damages is too narrow to cover the hard-to-compute expense of idle workers and machinery, commercial dislocation, and lost opportunities that may follow from a delay in delivery. The result is that courts tend to deny recovery for such losses. The reason given for denying such damages may be that compensation for losses of such magnitude were not contemplated by the parties; that the losses were not foreseeable; that they are remote or too speculative. Whatever the reasons for denying them (and denied they frequently are), the uncertainty of their availability ought to be good reason for permitting prompt cancellation by a buyer who is actually faced with such losses so that he can safely cover elsewhere and thus avoid them. Where such losses do not appear to be imminent, more latitude is (and ought to be) permitted to the defaulting seller.</p>
<h5 id="sec411" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">3. Defective Performance: Payment</span></h5>
<p class="indent">Defective payment is seldom a problem. When it arises, it involves such matters as the tender of a check when cash was specified or a tender of the wrong amount. Such error can usually be speedily corrected, and it is hard to see why the question of the extent to which a seller may immediately terminate ought not to be governed by the same considerations as those governing a late payment. Typically, there is the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page807" class="pagebreak">807</span>same—if not more—judicial reluctance to permit immediate cancellation for a defective tender of payment as there is when no payment at all is tendered. If the fault is not promptly corrected, of course, we have the same problem as in nonpayment: for how long and for how much should this seller be expected to extend credit that he may not originally have contemplated?</p>
<p id="sec412" class="noindent">U<small>NIFORM</small> C<small>OMMERCIAL</small> C<small>ODE</small>:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 2–511. Tender of Payment by Buyer; Payment by Check.</span></h4>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) Tender of payment is sufficient when made by any means or in any manner current in the ordinary course of business unless the seller demands payment in legal tender and gives any extension of time reasonably necessary to procure it.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<h5 id="sec413" class="secsub2"><span class="bold">4. Defective Performance: Delivery</span></h5>
<p class="indent">The effect of a delivery of goods or services that varies in quality or quantity from the contract specifications is a much more difficult and subtle problem. For here, as in the case of late delivery, the question of when the injured party can terminate is tied to the avoidable consequences rule. Hence, the injured buyer may lose his chance to recover for losses suffered if he does not “cover” when he should. R<small>ECALL</small>: Chapter Two, Topic III, Section B. If the performance is grossly defective in either quality or quantity, it may, of course, be considered no performance at all. This situation resembles that of a total non-delivery on the day on which performance was called for. But can a buyer reject a slightly defective performance and cancel?</p>
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that our concern here is solely with the availability of the cancellation power after a defective performance. A faulty performance entitles the injured party to some compensation for the resulting damages. The question is: should the injured party <span class="bold"><span class="italic">also</span></span> be entitled to terminate the contract because of faulty performance?</p>
<p class="indent">Simple arithmetic demonstrates why this is an important question. If Buyer has agreed to pay $5.00 per bushel for 1,000 bushels of wheat, and if the market on such wheat has dropped to $3.00 per bushel on the day on which Seller delivers only 900 bushels, how much money is Buyer ahead if he can reject the whole shipment and cancel rather than accept the goods? On the other hand, how much is he actually damaged by the shortage? If punitive damages are not recognized in the law of contracts, why should punitive cancellation be permitted? But why should the nonbreaching party be required to accept less than the performance he bargained for just to protect the breaching party’s windfall profit resulting from market change?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page808" class="pagebreak">808</div>
<p class="indent">The law is caught in this dilemma: it wants to reinforce reliance on contract by not showing too much tenderness to contract breakers, but it also must avoid the senseless economic dislocation, disregard of commercial realities, and disappointment of normal expectations that would follow if it were too quick to permit a cancellation because of less than complete performance. This dilemma injects questions of “fault” and “windfall” into this area of contract law—questions that we have seen are supposed to be irrelevant or nonexistent in determining damages. Unfortunately, a court’s actual weighting of these competing factors is seldom expressed in the reported opinions. Each case tends to depend on its special facts; and typically it is hard to pinpoint the decisive fact in any given case.</p>
<p class="indent">Admittedly, it is of small help to a lawyer to know that the client’s power to cancel depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The lawyer cannot be content to say: “That’s a very interesting problem.” The lawyer must advise the client what to do or not do. Look at the dilemma for the lawyer asked by the client for advice on how to act immediately following a breach by the client’s promisor: if the default is treated as minor or immaterial, the client may be stuck with a sick contract that is unlikely to work its problems out and which might more advantageously be replaced by a new deal with someone else. Relief for the breach through damages—though theoretically available—may be lost because of his failure to terminate and cover promptly enough and, even if not lost, may prove illusory. On the other hand, if the client treats the failure of performance as a contract-terminating event, he will be in very serious trouble if the court disagrees with his estimate of the significance of the breach. For in that unhappy event, the court is likely to treat the non-breaching party’s termination as a material breach in itself and require the wronged client to pay damages. Our present task is to find some helpful guidelines if we can.</p>

<p id="sec414" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Hope’s Architectural Products v. Lundy’s Construction</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">U.S. District Court, D. Kansas, 1991.</p>
<p class="sectionb">781 F.Supp. 711.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ L<small>UNGSTRUM</small>, D.J. This case presents a familiar situation in the field of construction contracts. Two parties, who disagreed over the meaning of their contract, held their positions to the brink, with litigation and loss the predictable result of the dispute. What is rarely predictable, however, (and what leads to a compromise <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page809" class="pagebreak">809</span>resolution of many construction disputes when cool heads hold sway) is which party will ultimately prevail. The stakes become winner-take-all.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff Hope’s Architectural Products (Hope’s) is a New York corporation that manufactures and installs custom window fixtures. Defendant Lundy’s Construction (Lundy’s) is a Kansas corporation that contracted to buy windows from Hope’s for a school remodeling project. Defendant Bank IV Olathe (Bank IV) is a national banking organization with its principal place of business in Kansas. Bank IV acted as surety for a statutory bond obtained by Lundy’s for the remodeling project.</p>
<p class="indent">Hope’s contends that Lundy’s breached the contract to buy windows, entitling Hope’s to damages in the amount of the contract price of $55,000. Hope’s also contends that Bank IV wrongfully refused to pay Hope’s on the bond when Lundy’s breached the contract. Hope’s has sued for breach of contract, and in the alternative, for recovery under the theory of quantum meruit….</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff Hope’s is a manufacturer of custom-built windows. The initial contact between Hope’s and Lundy’s occurred through Mr. Richard Odor, a regional agent for Hope’s in Kansas City. On June 29, 1988, Hope’s contracted with Lundy’s to manufacture ninety-three windows for the Rushton project. The contract price, including the cost of labor and materials for the windows, was $55,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the contract included a term pertaining to the time for delivering the windows, there is some controversy over the meaning of this provision. Even under the most favorable interpretation to Hope’s, however, delivery was due twelve to fourteen weeks after Hope’s received approved shop drawings from Lundy’s on July 18. Thus, delivery was due no later than October 24, 1988.</p>
<p class="indent">During the late summer and fall of 1988, several discussions took place between Hope’s and Lundy’s concerning when the windows would be delivered to the job site. Production of the windows was delayed by events that, according to the testimony of Mr. Odor, were not the fault of Lundy’s. On September 27, 1988, Mark Hannah, vice president of Lundy’s, wrote to Hope’s requesting that installation of the windows begin by October 19, and be completed by October 26. On October 14 Hannah again wrote to Hope’s, threatening to withhold “liquidated damages” from the contract price if Hope’s did not comply with these deadlines. Although there was no provision in the contract for liquidated damages, Hope’s did not make any response to the October 14 letter.</p>
<p class="indent">The windows were shipped from Hope’s New York plant to Kansas City on October 28. Delivery to the Rushton site was anticipated on November 4. On November 1, Hannah called Hope’s office in New York to inquire about the windows. He spoke to Kathy Anderson, Hope’s customer service manager. The substance of this conversation is disputed. Hope’s claims that Hannah threatened a back charge <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page810" class="pagebreak">810</span>of $11,000 (20% of the contract price) for late delivery of the windows. Hannah testified, however, that although the possibility of a back charge was discussed, no specific dollar amount was mentioned. Hannah specifically denies that he threatened to withhold $11,000 from the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">After her conversation with Hannah, Anderson immediately informed Chris Arvantinos, vice president of Hope’s, of the threatened back charge. Arvantinos called Hannah to discuss the back charge, but he does not recall hearing Hannah mention the $11,000 figure. Arvantinos requested that Hannah provide assurances that Lundy’s would not back charge Hope’s, but Hannah was unwilling to provide such assurances.</p>
<p class="indent">In a letter written on November 2, Arvantinos informed Hannah that Hope’s was suspending delivery of the windows until Lundy’s provided assurances that there would be no back charge. Hannah received this letter on the morning of November 3, shortly before Mr. Odor visited Hannah at Lundy’s. Odor, who had spoken with Arvantinos about the back charge, issued a new demand that Lundy’s had to meet before Hope’s would deliver the windows. He gave Hannah an invoice for the full amount of the contract price, demanding prepayment before the windows would be delivered.</p>
<p class="indent">Odor set out three ways that Lundy’s could meet this demand: (1) payment of the contract price in full by cashier’s check; (2) placement of the full contract price in an escrow account until the windows were installed; or (3) delivery of the full contract amount to the architect to hold until the windows were installed. All three options required Lundy’s to come up with $55,000 before the windows would be delivered. Hannah believed that the demand presented by Odor superseded the letter from Arvantinos he received earlier that morning.</p>
<p class="indent">Hannah informed Odor that there was no way for Lundy’s to get an advance from the school district at that time to comply with Hope’s request. The meeting ended, Lundy’s did not prepay, and Hope’s did not deliver the windows. On November 7, 1988, Lundy’s terminated the contract with Hope’s. Thereafter, Lundy’s obtained an alternate supplier of the windows.</p>
<p class="indent">On February 15, 1989, Hope’s notified defendant Bank IV of Lundy’s failure to pay the contract price and demanded payment from Bank IV on the public works bond. Bank IV refused to pay Hope’s claim….</p>
<p class="indent">At the outset, the Court concludes that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs this transaction. Article 2 of the UCC applies to transactions in goods. The contract at issue in this case involved a mixed goods/services transaction. Whether the UCC applies to hybrid transactions such as this depends upon “‘whether their predominant factor, their thrust, their purpose, reasonably stated, is the rendition of service, with goods incidentally involved * * * or is a transaction of sale, with labor <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page811" class="pagebreak">811</span>incidentally involved.’” If the UCC applies, it applies to all facets of the transaction. The transaction at issue in this case primarily involved a sale of windows, with installation and manufacturing services provided as an incidental component. Therefore, the UCC applies.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">A. Plaintiff’s Contract Claim Against Defendant Lundy’s</span></p>
<p class="indent">This case turns on the resolution of two central and interrelated issues: (1) when was delivery due under the contract, and (2) could Hope’s lawfully demand the assurances it demanded from Lundy’s under K.S.A. § 84–2–609. If the demands for assurances were proper, then Hope’s would have been justified in suspending its performance and withholding delivery and Lundy’s failure to provide assurances and subsequent termination of the contract amounted to a total breach. If, however, the demands for assurances were not proper under 84–2–609 then Hope’s breached the contract by wrongfully withholding delivery of the windows and Lundy’s was entitled to cancel the contract. The delivery date issue is addressed first because the matter of whether or not Hope’s was already in breach for late delivery goes directly to the propriety of its demand for assurances.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">1. Delivery Date</span></p>
<p class="indent">Even under Hope’s interpretation of the delivery term, delivery of the windows was not timely. At trial, Chris Arvantinos, Hope’s vice president, testified that Hope’s committed to deliver the windows twelve to fourteen weeks after July 18, 1988, the day Hope’s received approved shop drawings. This would make delivery due between October 10 and October 24. In fact, the windows did not arrive in Kansas City until November 4, fifteen and one-half weeks after July 18. Hope’s claims that this delay was “immaterial” and did not excuse Lundy’s from its duties under the contract. Hope’s is unable to cite any controlling authority to support this argument, however. Moreover, this argument misses the point. Even if an “immaterial” delay did not excuse future performance by Lundy’s, no performance was due from Lundy’s until the windows were delivered to the job site, which never occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">Hope’s also argues, almost in passing, that the delay was caused by problems that were outside of its control, thus excusing Hope’s from responsibility for the late delivery. Under a clause in the contract, Hope’s disclaimed responsibility “for delayed shipments and deliveries occasioned by strikes, fires, accidents, delays of common carriers or other causes beyond our control….” During the course of production, Hope’s experienced problems with its “bonderizing” and prime paint system, which resulted in a delay in production of approximately two weeks. Hope’s produced no evidence at trial, however, to show that this was a matter which was beyond its control. Moreover, it is interesting to note that Hope’s did not contemporaneously seek from Lundy’s any extension of the delivery date under this provision or notify Lundy’s that it might result in a delay beyond October 24. It <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page812" class="pagebreak">812</span>appears that reference to this clause is more of an afterthought born of litigation than a bona fide excuse for modifying the delivery date.</p>
<p class="indent">Hope’s also contends that a three to four day delay resulted when Lundy’s asked for a change in the design of the windows to include “weep holes” after production had already begun. However, Hope’s representative, Odor, testified that nothing Lundy’s did delayed Hope’s manufacturing. Moreover, even accounting for this delay, Hope’s was a week late delivering the windows.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">2. Section 2–609 Demand for Assurances</span></p>
<p class="indent">Although nothing in the record indicates that Hope’s expressly claimed any rights under 84–2–609 during the course of this transaction, Hope’s asserted at trial that the October 14 letter from Lundy’s demanding delivery by October 16 and threatening liquidated damages gave Hope’s reasonable grounds for insecurity. Delivery was not due until October 24 under Hope’s version of the parties’ agreement, and Lundy’s had no right to demand performance early, let alone broach the withholding of liquidated damages. This letter might have justified a demand for assurances under 84–2–609. However, Hope’s made no such demand after receiving the letter. Instead of invoking its rights under 84–2–609, Hope’s chose not to respond at all to Lundy’s threat of liquidated damages. This event merely came and went without any legal consequence.</p>
<p class="indent">Hope’s in effect invoked its rights under 84–2–609 in response to Lundy’s threat of a back charge during the November 1 phone conversations. Two separate demands for assurances were made in response to this threat. Initially, Chris Arvantinos demanded assurances that Lundy’s would not back charge Hope’s for the delayed shipment in a telephone conversation with Mark Hannah later in the day on November 1. Arvantinos memorialized this demand in a letter composed on that day and mailed on the second of November. In their telephone conversation, Hannah refused to provide assurances that Lundy’s would not back charge Hope’s.</p>
<p class="indent">Hope’s made a second demand for assurances on November 3, when Richard Odor presented Hope’s invoice to Hannah demanding payment in full. Thus, Hope’s demanded assurances that it would not be back charged on November 1, and when that demand was refused, Hope’s made a second demand on November 3. The Court finds that Hope’s was not entitled to invoke 84–2–609 on either occasion.</p>
<p class="indent">When Hope’s made its first demand for assurances on November 1, it was already in breach of the parties’ agreement. Delivery of the windows was due by October 24, but the windows did not arrive in Kansas City until November 4. A party already in breach is not entitled to invoke section 2–609 by demanding assurances. To hold otherwise would allow a party to avoid liability for breaching its contract by invoking 2–609 to extract from the nonbreaching party an assurance that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page813" class="pagebreak">813</span>no damages will be sought for the breach. A nonbreaching party in need of prompt performance could be coerced into giving up its right to damages for the breach by giving in to the demands in order to receive the needed performance. This Court refuses to endorse such a result.</p>
<p class="indent">Lundy’s argues that Hope’s demand for assurances in the November 2 letter from Arvantinos was overly broad and unreasonable. The letter informed Lundy’s that Hope’s would not deliver the windows to the job site until it received assurances that it would not “be backcharged or otherwise held responsible for liquidated damages, delay charges or any extra costs on account of time of delivery of the windows.” When this demand was made, the windows had not yet arrived in Kansas City. Therefore, the parties did not know at this time whether the proper quantity of windows had been shipped, whether the windows were the correct size, or whether they otherwise met Lundy’s specifications. If there were any nonconformities in the shipment, there could have been another delay in the time of delivery while Hope’s corrected the problem. Yet, Hope’s demanded a blanket assurance that it would not be held responsible for any extra costs incurred because of “time of delivery of the windows.” This demand was overly broad on its face and unreasonable under 84–2–609.</p>
<p class="indent">The assurances Hope’s demanded on November 3 were also excessive. In his meeting with Mark Hannah, Richard Odor insisted that Lundy’s prepay the contract price, deliver a cashier’s check to the architect, or place the full contract price in an escrow account before the windows would be delivered. Yet, Lundy’s never gave any indication that it was unable or unwilling to pay the amount it owed to Hope’s when the windows were delivered and the bond stood as security for Lundy’s obligation. Such a demand was unreasonable and amounted to a breach by Hope’s. <span class="italic">See Pittsburgh–Des Moines Steel v. Brookhaven Manor Water Co.</span> (demanding under 2–609 a personal guarantee of payment from a shareholder, or that other party escrow the entire amount of the contract price before it was due, absent any showing of an inability to pay, was unreasonable); <span class="italic">Scott v. Crown</span> (demanding payment in full before it was due was unreasonable demand under 2–609 and amounted to anticipatory breach). The payment terms under the contract were “Progress payments by the 10th of each month covering 90% of the total value of materials delivered and installation performed during the previous month with final payment upon completion of our [Hope’s] work.” By demanding prepayment, Hope’s essentially attempted to rewrite this term of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Hope’s contends that a threatened back charge of $11,000 for a one week delay in shipment justified its demand for prepayment, the Court is not persuaded that Lundy’s made any specific demand for $11,000. The testimony on this issue was controverted, but only Kathy Anderson, Hope’s customer service manager, testified, in a perfunctory manner, that an $11,000 back charge was threatened. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page814" class="pagebreak">814</span>Mark Hannah specifically denied making such a demand. Neither Chris Arvantinos nor Richard Odor testified to recalling receiving such a demand. There was also testimony at trial from one witness for Hope’s that the threatened back charge was in the amount of $5,000. The Court is not persuaded that Lundy’s went beyond making unspecified threats of a back charge for possible damages it would incur because of Hope’s delay.</p>
<p class="indent">By threatening to withhold damages from the contract price, Lundy’s was merely exercising its rights under K.S.A. § 84–2–717,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_152" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-152" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> which entitles a buyer to deduct from the amount owing on the contract any damages from the seller’s breach. Giving notice of its intention to avail itself of a legal right did not indicate that Lundy’s was unwilling or unable to perform under the contract. Indeed, the very nature of the right invoked by Lundy’s manifests an intention that it would continue performing and pay the contract price due, less damages caused by Hope’s delay. Thus, the demand for prepayment was unreasonably excessive when there was no indication that Lundy’s would not pay Hope’s when performance was due.</p>
<p class="indent">Both Hope’s delay in delivering the windows and Hope’s excessive demands entitled Lundy’s to treat Hope’s as in breach and to cancel the contract, which it did on November 7, 1988. K.S.A. § 84–2–711 (1983) (“Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates * * * the buyer may cancel * * *.”). Thus, Hope’s is not entitled to recover under its claim for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">B. Plaintiff’s Quantum Meruit Claim</span></p>
<p class="indent">Hope’s also claims that it is entitled to compensation from Lundy’s under the theory of quantum meruit. “Quantum meruit,” which literally means “as much as he deserves,” is a phrase used often in older cases to describe an equitable doctrine premised on the theories of unjust enrichment and restitution. Recovery was allowed under this theory when a benefit had been received by a party and it would be inequitable to allow the party to retain it. Instead of labeling it quantum meruit, courts today speak in terms of restitution.</p>
<p class="indent">To recover in restitution, a breaching plaintiff must have conferred a benefit on the nonbreaching party. The burden is on the breaching party to prove the extent of the benefit conferred, and doubts will be resolved against him.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, Hope’s conferred no benefit on Lundy’s. The windows manufactured by Hope’s were never used in the Rushton project, and the Court is not persuaded that the installation advice provided by Christiansen Steel Erection for Hope’s improved the project. Hope’s admits that the only labor it claims to have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page815" class="pagebreak">815</span>provided at the Rushton job site was consultation work performed by Christiansen Steel Erection, a company Hope’s subcontracted with to install the windows. Mike and John Christiansen visited the job site on several occasions to advise Lundy’s on how to prepare the window openings for installation. The advice they provided, however, related to the installation of windows that were never used on the project. When Lundy’s canceled its contract with Hope’s, it obtained an alternate supplier of a different type of windows. These windows did not require the same careful preparation of the window openings as the Hope’s windows. Lundy’s job foreman testified that the Christiansens’ advice became moot when the alternate supplier was obtained. “[A] party’s expenditures in preparation for performance that do not confer a benefit on the other party do not give rise to a restitution interest.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 370 comment a (1977). Thus, because no benefit was conferred upon Lundy’s, Hope’s has no valid claim to restitution.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III. C<small>ONCLUSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">After careful consideration of the facts and law, this Court holds that Hope’s breached the contract in question. Therefore, defendant Lundy’s was entitled to cancel its performance and defendant Bank IV was not obligated to pay Hope’s under the statutory bond.</p>
<p id="sec415" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Hope’s is not entitled to damages because it is the party in breach, and it is not entitled to restitution because Lundy’s never accepted the windows and, therefore, Hope’s conferred no benefit. In the end it is stuck with $55,000 in custom windows that probably cannot be resold on the market. All because it was a week-and-a-half late in making delivery on a fourteen-week contract!</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What would you advise Hope’s to do when it became clear to it that the windows would not be in Kansas City by October 19? What advice would you give on October 14 after it received the letter from Lundy’s vice president threatening to withhold “liquidated damages”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. As the problems escalated, why didn’t the parties realize it might be in their interests to accommodate the other at least a little bit? The court seems to suggest that once it was clear that Hope’s’ delivery was going to be late, it lost all claims to demand assurances from Lundy’s that there would not be an extortionate back charge on the money due it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Notwithstanding its real insecurity, wouldn’t Hope’s have been better off to go forward with delivery and install the windows and then assert its claim for the price? How big a factor was the concern that it might cost more than the amount at stake for a New York company to litigate in Kansas?</p>

<p class="indent">A decision that a breach is material and therefore a terminating condition can produce harsh results. If the parties are aware of the potential problem at the time of contract formation, they can plan for the contingency and avoid it by carefully defining the requirements of performance and the consequences of default. However, parties tend to be optimistic at the time of contract formation; they hope for the best and assume that the contract will be performed, not breached. When a difficulty arises during performance and the parties are unable to resolve it, litigation may ensue. If the breach is very serious, the court will have no difficulty in finding it material and casting the entire loss on the breaching party. Conversely, if the breach is minor, a finding that it is immaterial and therefore not a condition leaves the injured party to his remedy at damages and the obligations of further performance undisturbed. But in many commonly encountered situations, neither extreme seems appropriate. In such a case the court may turn instead to familiar notions of restitution to provide the party in breach with some relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Many commercial contracts call for a series of deliveries for performance in return for a corresponding series of payments. As the seller ships goods in installments, the buyer is obligated to pay. As the worker performs services, the employer is obligated to make periodic wage or salary payments. As the builder completes each phase of the construction project, the owner becomes obligated to make a partial payment. There is a single contract, but many of its obligations are divisible into segments as performance proceeds.</p>
<p class="indent">Other transactions seem better analyzed as a series of free standing transactions, with each delivery and its matching payment forming a separate deal. The breach of one part, although serious, does not necessarily affect the other transactions between the parties. But when there is a long-term arrangement for continuing deliveries and related payments, it may be more realistic to treat the deal as one transaction, although divided into installments.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept of the divisible or installment contract has developed in a way that enables courts to do substantial justice. The breaching seller can bring a price action for the installments satisfactorily completed. A disappointed buyer’s obligation to pay for a nonconforming installment is at least suspended, and he can sue for damages as to that installment. The basic material-immaterial breach distinction remains available to the court in deciding when to treat the entire contract as terminated to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page817" class="pagebreak">817</span>protect the seller against undue credit risk when the buyer doesn’t pay and to protect the buyer against an untrustworthy seller who has shown that it cannot be relied upon to make proper delivery.</p>

<p class="sectionb">Wisconsin Supreme Court, 1909.</p>
<p class="sectionb">141 Wis. 63, 123 N.W. 624.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff corporation is a manufacturer and dealer in knitted goods at Milwaukee, and the defendant corporation is a jobber in the same line of goods at Ripon. In November, 1905, the defendant ordered of the plaintiff, in writing, a quantity of gloves of different kinds at fixed prices, aggregating $322.86, delivery to be made in the following May, bill to be dated as of November 1, 1906, payable in 30 days. The order was accepted, and in April the plaintiff delivered the greater part of the goods ordered, but never delivered one item of 18 dozen gloves, and another item of 6 dozen gloves. The plaintiff sues to recover for the goods actually delivered at contract prices. The defendant contends that the contract is entire, and hence that nothing is due, because the contract has never been fully performed. The defendant also sets up a counterclaim for damages because of nondelivery of said two items, in case the court should hold the contract to be severable. The trial court held the contract to be severable, and awarded judgment for the plaintiff for the contract price of the items delivered, less damages, consisting of the loss of profits, on the items not delivered. From this judgment, defendant appeals.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ W<small>INSLOW</small>, C.J. (after stating the facts as above). We think that the business world would be astonished to learn that whenever an order for a bill of merchandise is accepted the contract thus made is entire, and requires delivery of every article before there can be recovery of any part of the purchase price. Such would be the practical effect of the defendant’s contention here, if it should be upheld. We cannot so hold. The question of entirety is a question of intention. Severability of the subject-matter and measurement of consideration by units may assist in determining, but do not of themselves necessarily determine, the question. In case of a contract naturally and accurately severable (such as a contract for the sale of a bill of goods at certain prices for each article), courts incline to hold the contract severable, and to grant a recovery for that portion of the goods actually delivered, less damages for the nondelivery of any portion not delivered. Under all ordinary circumstances, this course will result in exact justice. The vendor will receive pay for his goods, which the vendee has <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page818" class="pagebreak">818</span>retained, and the vendee will receive compensation for any damage which he has actually suffered.</p>
<p class="indent">If, however, it appears by express terms or by necessary implication from the terms of a contract that the intention of the parties was to make payment of the consideration depend upon delivery of all the articles, the contract will be held entire, though the consideration may be measured in units and be actually severable. Thus, when a contract required the delivery of 2,000 yards of crushed stone for the purpose of building a bridge, it was held to be entire, notwithstanding the payment was to be at a certain rate per yard. So contracts to tow a given quantity of logs at so much per 1,000 feet, and to carry 5,000 barrels of salt at so much per barrel, have been held entire, upon the idea that the terms of the contract, in the light of the surrounding facts, showed that the parties evidently intended to contract for one entire job, and only used the unit of measurement of the consideration for convenience, and not as indicating any contemplation of severability.</p>
<p class="indent">The principle here decided is that contracts for the sale of goods like the present, which are naturally severable, will not be held entire contracts, in the absence of express or implied provision to that effect in the contract, or persuasive circumstances showing the intention of the parties to make it entire.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed.</p>

<p id="sec420" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Graulich Caterer v. Hans Holterbosch</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, 1968.</p>
<p class="sectionb">101 N.J.Super. 61, 243 A.2d 253.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ F<small>OLEY</small>, J.A.D. Plaintiff, caterers, take this appeal from a judgment for defendant rejecting plaintiff’s suit sounding in contract.* * *</p>
<p class="indent">Contact between the litigants sprung from the turmoil surrounding the preparations for the opening of the 1964 New York World’s Fair. Holterbosch, an American importer and distributor of Lowenbrau beer, was granted the franchise to operate the Lowenbrau Pavilion at the Fair. Final approval of this award was given on or about January 15, 1964 and contemplated an April 15, 1964 opening. This was the last major pavilion awarded, making time essential in all of defendant’s considerations.</p>
<p class="indent">In aid of this enterprise defendant engaged a metropolitan-based industrial design consultant, Becker &amp; Becker Associates, to formulate a feasible production plan for serving the required beer and, as a desired adjunct, platters of German food. As stated by defendant, the goal of both Lowenbrau and Holterbosch was the “quality concept of merchandising.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Raytheon Corporation, knowing the Becker firm’s privy role and eager to market their microwave concept of cooking, suggested plaintiff’s name to Becker as one able to discharge the culinary requirements of the Lowenbrau Pavilion. Thus approached by Becker, plaintiff on March 10, 1964 entered into preliminary negotiations with the consultant regarding the feasibility of the Raytheon Microwave cooking concept as related to the superior quality of food desired by defendant….</p>
<p class="indent">At the March 10, 1964 meeting Becker and another employee of the planning firm reviewed with approval ten general food samples submitted by Graulich. Defendant Holterbosch did not personally attend this initial meeting. Informed of defendant’s needs, plaintiff redesigned the samples and presented eight platters at a second meeting held on March 17, 1964….</p>
<p class="indent">The samples presented and approved on March 17, 1964, were prepared in the Graulich commissary at Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, by plaintiff’s employees and were presented to defendant at the Raytheon office in New York City. The operation was agreed upon, with the initial delivery set for April 15, 1964….</p>
<p class="indent">The delayed and muddled opening of the Fair brought the parties into daily, and at times even hourly, contact. Postponements followed premature orders until a firm order for April 23, 1964 was placed by Mr. Leigh, an employee of Becker &amp; Becker. Upon delivery the members of defendant’s organization were stunned by the product and complained immediately that the tendered units did not, in any way, match the contract samples. Rejecting this 955–unit installment as unacceptable, defendant described the food as “bland,” unpresentable, tasteless and “just wasn’t <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page821" class="pagebreak">821</span>the type of food that we could sell.” Notwithstanding this low grade delivery, defendant, obligated to the Fair to serve food and committed in theory to the Raytheon ovens, conferred with the equally dissatisfied plaintiff in seeking to improve the quality standard of the product to the point where it would be acceptable….</p>
<p class="indent">The second delivery, made on April 25, 1964, was likewise unacceptable. Of the 2520 units delivered, between 500 to 700 were distributed among the employees and patrons of the exhibit for a fast reaction. The complaints in response to the food were many and varied. Defendant, describing the sources of unfavorable comment, stated that the sauerbraten was dry and the gravy, pasty and unpalatably “gooey,” surrounded rather than enveloped the meat. The knockwurst platter suffered similarly, being dry and comparing unfavorably with the standards established by the samples. Generally, defendant complained that the food was simply not “German food” and as such was unacceptable for the Lowenbrau Pavilion.</p>
<p class="indent">Giving due regard to the original trier’s opportunity to observe the demeanor and to judge the credibility of the witnesses, we find as a matter of fact that the deliveries of April 23 and 25, 1964 did not conform to the samples originally presented and approved. Since warranties of sample and description are characterized as “express warranties,” the “whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.” § 2–313(1)(c). The “goods” to “conform” to the sample or model must be “in accordance with the obligations under the contract” § 2–106(2); here, to comply with the standards established by the March 17 taste-test of the samples. Any distinguishing language would be controlled by the sample as presented on March 17. Additionally, the implied warranty of fitness for purpose attaches to contracts of this type, where, as here, they are not specifically excluded. A breach of these warranties triggers a buyer’s rights following seller’s breach as catalogued in § 2–711. These remedies include, but are not limited to, cancellation §§ 2–711(1), 2–106(4). “if the breach goes to the whole of the contract.” § 2–612(3).</p>
<p class="indent">Here, Holterbosch had the right to reject any installment that was nonconforming, provided that the nonconformity substantially impaired the value of that installment and could not be cured. “Cure,” novel to New Jersey’s jurisprudence, permits the seller to cure a defective tender through repair, replacement or price allowance if he reasonably notifies the buyer of his curative intention and, in effecting the cure, makes a timely conforming delivery.</p>
<p class="indent">The effect of the installment contract section, § 2–612(2), is to extend the time for cure past the contract delivery date for that nonconforming installment, provided the nonconformity does not “substantially [impair] the value of that installment” and can be cured. We find that Holterbosch was justified in rejecting Graulich’s tender of the April 23 initial installment since the nonconformity of the tendered goods with the accepted sample was incurable, and thus substantially impaired the value of that installment.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page822" class="pagebreak">822</div>
<p class="indent">Replacing considerations of anticipatory repudiation and the material injury with the test of substantial impairment, § 2–612, adopts a more restrictive seller-oriented approach favoring “the continuance of the contract in the absence of an overt cancellation.” To allow an aggrieved party to cancel an installment contract, § 2–612(3), requires (1) the breach be of the whole contract which occurs when the nonconformity of “one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract;” and (2) that seasonable notification of cancellation has been given if the buyer has accepted a nonconforming installment.</p>
<p class="indent">What amounts to substantial impairment presents a question of fact. Analyzing this factual question, the New Jersey commentators counsel that the test as to whether the nonconformity in any given installment justifies cancelling the entire contract depends on whether the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of the whole contract, and not on whether it indicates an intent or likelihood that the future deliveries also will be defective. Continuing, the Comment relates the intent underlying a breach to insecurity and those sections of the Code providing buyer with adequate assurance of performance, § 2–609, and anticipatory repudiation, § 2–610. More practical in its treatment of “substantial impairment,” the official Comment states that “substantial impairment of the value of an installment can turn not only on the quality of the goods but also on such factors as time, quantity, assortment and the like. It must be judged in terms of the normal or specifically known purposes of the contract.” Comment to § 2–612, ¶ 4.</p>
<p class="indent">At the Lowenbrau Pavilion on April 23, 1964 plaintiff Graulich, timely noticed of the nonconforming initial tender, gave assurance that future tenders would be cured to match the original samples. Unequivocally committed to the microwave kitchen method, defendant lent plaintiff three members from its staff in aid of this adjustment. Since plaintiff was given the opportunity to cure, there is no need to touch upon the substantiality of the initial nonconforming installment.</p>
<p class="indent">The second installment tender was as unsatisfactory as the first. The meat was dry, the gravy “gooey” and the complaints abundant. After the nonconforming second delivery it became apparent that eleventh-hour efforts attempting to rework and adjust the platters failed. Translating this into legal parlance, there was a nonconforming tender of the initial installment on a contract for the sale of goods; upon tender the buyer Holterbosch notified the seller Graulich of the nonconformity and unacceptable nature of the platters tendered; the failure of the cure assured by plaintiff, seller, was evidenced by a subsequently defective nonconforming delivery. The second unacceptable delivery and the failure of plaintiff’s additional curative efforts left defendant in a position for one week without food. Time was critical. Plaintiff knew that platters of maximum quality were required on a daily installment basis. Because of defendant’s immediate need for quality food and plaintiff’s failure to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page823" class="pagebreak">823</span>cure, we find that the nonconformity of the second delivery, projected upon the circumstances of this case, “substantially impair[ed] the value of the whole contract [and resulted in] a breach of the whole.” § 2–612(3). If the breach goes to the whole contract the buyer may cancel the whole contract. § 2–711(1). Accordingly, we find that Holterbosch was justified in cancelling the installment agreement signed on April 1, 1964.</p>
<p class="indent">Since defendant’s counterclaim was withdrawn it is unnecessary to treat of the right retained by a cancelling party to press any remedy for breach of the whole contract. § 2–106(4).</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment in favor of defendant for the reasons herein stated. Costs to defendant.</p>
<p id="sec421" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. If Graulich shows up the first time with gooey sauerbraten, does Holterbosch have to accept it? If it does take the sauerbraten, but it is not a perfect tender, does it have to pay for what it takes? If so, at what rate must it pay?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Is Holterbosch entitled to damages every time Graulich shows up with gooey sauerbraten? Does the answer depend on whether Holterbosch accepts the delivery? How would the damages be measured? If Holterbosch really needs the sauerbraten badly to meet the demands of customers and cannot find a substitute on the market, will a court award it specific performance?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Does Holterbosch have to give Graulich another chance and let it cure the defects in its sauerbraten the first time even if the stuff is terrible and not even close to what was called for by the contract? When can it stop giving Graulich another chance? Does there come a time when it must stop letting Graulich have any more chances? When is that?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The court in this case gives great emphasis to continuing, if possible, the relationship created by the contract. This approach is consistent with the dominant attitude of the UCC and makes sense if the problem is a little defect which can certainly be cured. But if this is terrible sauerbraten, produced by a unique and novel process how likely is it that Graulich will ever be able to make conforming deliveries? If it is not likely, why keep the sick relationship alive?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page824" class="pagebreak">824</div>
<h4 id="sec422" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">E.   T<small>HE</small> P<small>ERFECT</small> T<small>ENDER</small> R<small>ULE</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">The perfect tender doctrine states that full tender of perfectly conforming goods is a condition precedent to the purchaser’s obligation to pay under the contract. Why must a buyer take the goods if they aren’t what was ordered? If a buyer does accept the goods, or any part of them, does buyer lose any claim for damages arising from the nonconformity to contract terms? Does the buyer have to pay at the contract rate for what is received?</p>
<p class="indent">The perfect tender rule logically flows from commitment to freedom of contract and the enforceability of promises. No one compelled the promisor to make any particular promise, but having made the promise, the promisor has no complaint if he is held to the precise performance promised. The other party should not have to pay the promised price for something other than what he bargained for.</p>
<p class="indent">If our concern were limited to the parties, then strict observance of a perfect tender rule might be justifiable. But what of the broader social interests in the transaction? In addition to the personal hardships involved, contract termination for imperfect tender is socially expensive and is likely to result in significant economic dislocation. The social interest is usually to keep the deal going if possible and to redress losses by awarding damages without cancelling the contract. To this end, the UCC imports concepts of cure, partial acceptance, and installment contracts to mitigate the rigors of a perfect tender rule. These, it should be noted, are all mitigating notions taken from the common law, where they are sometimes obscured in the double talk of courts straining for a just result without doing apparent violence to a rigid rule.</p>

<p id="sec423" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Printing Center of Texas v. Supermind Publishing Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Texas Court of Appeals, Houston, 1984.</p>
<p class="sectionb">669 S.W.2d 779.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>ANNON</small>, J. Appellee sued appellant for refund of a deposit made under a written contract to print 5000 books entitled <span class="italic">Supermind Supermemory</span>. Appellee alleged that it rightfully rejected the books upon delivery under Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. § 2.601 and that it has a right to cancel the contract and recover the part of the purchase price paid under Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. § 2.711. The trial court awarded appellee refund of its $2900 deposit and $3000 as reasonable attorney’s fees on the verdict of the jury.</p>
<p class="indent">We note that appellee may have tried this suit on the wrong legal theory and if so, the judgment of the trial court is not supported by the jury findings. The parties <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page825" class="pagebreak">825</span>tried this suit on the assumption that the provisions of the Texas Uniform Commercial Code governed their contract for the printing of books. Chapter 2 of the Code is limited to transactions involving the sale of goods. A contract to print books involves the sale of both goods and services. The printer sells goods which consist of paper and ink and services consisting of binding, typesetting, proofing, etc. “In such hybrid transactions, the question becomes whether the dominant factor or essence of the transaction is the sale of materials or of services.”</p>
<p class="indent">It appears to us that the services are the essence or the dominant factor of a printing contract; therefore, Chapter 2 of the Code would not apply. Special issue number one inquired of the jury whether the books delivered to appellee failed in any respect to conform to the contract. The affirmative answer to this issue does not give the purchaser a right to reject and to recover a refund of the purchase price under the common law of contracts as it would under Chapter 2 of the Code. The buyer’s remedy in that case would be damages for breach of contract. The equitable relief of rescission of the contract will not be granted for breach of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant has not assigned a point of error as to whether the trial court’s judgment is supported by the verdict of the jury. Therefore any error concerning this point is waived. We indulge in the doubtful assumption that Chapter 2 of the Code governs the contract between parties to enable us to adequately consider appellant’s points of error.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant contends in its second point of error that jury finding that the books failed to conform to the contract is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. This finding is related to whether appellee had a right to reject the books under § 2.601 which states in part: “* * * if the goods or tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the contract, the buyer may (1) reject the whole * * *.”</p>
<p class="indent">This provision has been called the perfect tender rule because it supposedly allows a buyer to reject whenever the goods are less than perfect. This statement is not quite accurate; under section 2.601 the tender must be perfect only in the sense that the proffered goods must conform to the contract in every respect. Conformity does not mean substantial performance; it means complete performance. The long standing doctrine of sales law that “there is no room in commercial contracts for the doctrine of substantial performance” is carried forward into section 2.601. Substantial compliance is not the legal equivalent of conformity with the contract under section 2.601.</p>
<p class="indent">In analyzing whether tendered goods are conforming, the contract of the parties must first be determined. “Conform” is defined in § 2.106(b), as “in accordance with the obligations under the contract.” The contract of the parties includes more than the words used by the parties. It encompasses “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page826" class="pagebreak">826</span>course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance as provided in the Code.” § 1.201(11) and § 1.201(3). Thus, the terms of a contract may be explained and supplemented through trade usage, but it may not be used to contradict an express term. § 2.202. The existence and scope of trade usage must be proved as facts. § 1.205(b). A buyer has a right to reject goods under section 2.601 if the goods fail to conform to either the express or implied terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the contract of the parties has been determined, the evidence must be reviewed to see if the right goods were tendered at the right time and place. If the evidence does establish nonconformity in some respect, the buyer is entitled to reject if he rejects in good faith. § 1.203 provides that, “Every contract or duty within this Act imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.” Since the rejection of goods is a matter of performance, the buyer is obligated to act in good faith when he rejects the goods. Where the buyer is a merchant, his standard of good faith rejection requires honesty in fact and observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade. § 2.103(a)(2). If the seller alleges that the buyer rejected in bad faith, the seller has the burden of proof on this issue. Evidence of circumstances which indicate that the buyer’s motivation in rejecting the goods was to escape the bargain, rather than to avoid acceptance of a tender which in some respect impairs the value of the bargain to him, would support a finding of rejection in bad faith. Thus, evidence of rejection of the goods on account of a minor defect in a falling market would in some instances be sufficient to support a finding that the buyer acted in bad faith when he rejected the goods.</p>
<p class="indent">The written contract between the parties which is expressed in a bid proposal dated July 31, 1981 covers only essential terms such as quantity, trim size, and type of paper and cover. The type of paper specified in the contract was thirty pound white newsprint. Appellee’s witness testified that he was shown a sample of the newsprint to be used and that the tendered books were not the same color as the sample. The witness stated the pages of the books were gray while the sample was white. This testimony is evidence of nonconformity because any sample which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample. § 2.313(a)(3).</p>
<p class="indent">Other nonconformities which appellee alleges and offers proof of are off center cover art, crooked pages, wrinkled pages and inadequate perforation on a pull out page. The contract does not expressly address any of these matters. Although evidence of trade usage may have indicated that these conditions are contrary to the standards of commercial practice within the publishing industry, appellant failed to offer evidence of trade usage to supplement the contract. However, appellant knew that appellee wanted the books printed for sale to the public. In these circumstances, it is implied in the contract that the books be commercially acceptable and appealing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page827" class="pagebreak">827</span>to the public. Section 2.314 states that a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale and that for goods to be merchantable, they must pass without objection in the trade and be fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. A jury could reasonably conclude that books with crooked and wrinkled pages, off center cover art, and inadequate perforation are not fit for sale to the public. We find sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that the books did not conform to the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant contends that if nonconformities exist, they are minor and that appellee rejected the books in bad faith. Appellant has failed to carry its burden to prove that appellee rejected the books in bad faith. First, we do not agree with appellant’s contention that the alleged nonconformities should be classified as minor. Second, there is no evidence which indicates that appellee’s primary motivation in rejection of the books was to escape a bad bargain. We also note that appellant has waived its defense of rejection in bad faith by its failure to request an issue on this defense, because it has not conclusively established it under the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant’s second point of error is overruled.</p>

<p class="indent">Deciding when a defective performance should be a contract-terminating event is particularly troublesome when the goods are specially manufactured or are structures built on land. In these situations, the disappointed buyer has limited opportunities to cover for her losses in the market, and the disappointed seller is likely to have even more limited opportunities to resell the goods to others in the market. Losses can quickly rise to catastrophic levels when these factors are present. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page828" class="pagebreak">828</span>The doctrine of substantial performance has developed to deal with these special problems.</p>
<p class="indent">As is so often the case, the origins of this doctrine are connected with a procedural problem. To plead a cause of action for contract damages the plaintiff must allege that she has performed all of her obligations under the contract. In theory at least, a party in breach may not bring an action for damages, even if the breach is slight and damages suffered by the other side’s failure to perform are great. The builder may have produced the whole office building, but if the tile in the restroom on the 14th floor does not match contract specifications, relief based on the contract price will be denied. Of course, in jurisdictions that recognize a restitutionary action by parties in breach, the builder may be able to recover <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> for the benefit conferred, but in a number of jurisdictions this remedy is unavailable. One important motive in the early cases recognizing substantial performance was the desire to allow a builder to allege a claim in contract by stating that the construction project was substantially, if not perfectly, performed. After all, what construction project is perfectly performed? When used in this way, “substantial performance” means full performance. When a builder substantially performs, she has performed.</p>
<p class="indent">Over time this procedural concern merged with a more substantive concern for allowing the builder to recover based on the contract price despite immaterial breaches. Allowing an action based on contract price avoids all of the inherent uncertainties of measurement of restitutionary relief. Substantial performance came to be recognized as a rough equivalent of performance subject to immaterial breach.</p>
<p class="indent">In some cases, most famously <span class="italic">Jacob &amp; Youngs v. Kent</span>, p. 833, substantial performance came to have an even broader meaning. Now substantial performance becomes the basis for granting recovery to the builder even though the project deviates significantly from the contract terms. By use of a special “diminished value” basis for measuring owner’s damages, the doctrine may require owners to pay for performances that are quite different from what was agreed to, so long as the market value of the final product has not been diminished by the variation.</p>

<p class="sectionb">Wisconsin Supreme Court, 1903.</p>
<p class="sectionb">120 Wis. 1, 97 N.W. 515.</p>
<p class="indent">Action to recover the contract price and enforce a lien for supplying a steam boiler to the defendant. The evidence disclosed that the defendant operated a glue factory, requiring a large amount of steam, not only for power, but also for heating and drying; that it had an old tubular boiler, which had been manufactured by the plaintiff, and with which and its use the plaintiff was entirely familiar; that in such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page829" class="pagebreak">829</span>situation the parties negotiated for a new boiler, the defendant stating to the plaintiff that the old boiler was inadequate—that it had a commercial rating of about 80 horse power, and that one was needed of about 100 horse power. The plaintiff’s manager counseled one still larger, namely, to rate about 125 horse power, as compared with the old one, 80 horse power. The agreement finally reached was that the new one should be substantially of 50 per cent. more capacity than the old, but was to be of the Scotch type, instead of the tubular type. Plaintiff constructed a boiler of the Scotch type, put it in place in a building and upon brick foundation constructed by the defendant for that purpose. After it was connected up, it was found disappointing in capacity, and not up to the old boiler, but was used, in connection with the old one, to furnish the steam necessary for the factory, while efforts were made both by plaintiff and defendant to make it work more efficiently. These efforts being still unsatisfactory, the defendant complained of the boiler as not satisfying the contract, and, as the defendant’s manager testifies, desired to have it taken away. The plaintiff’s manager testifies that thereupon he proposed to have a test made, and, if it did not satisfy the contract, he would either take it out and put in a new one, or enlarge it so as to make it of the necessary capacity. That test was made, the plaintiff contending that it showed the boiler to satisfy the contract, the defendant contending that it did not, but meanwhile using the boiler to supply in part the steam needed to keep its factory running. The date of this test is not disclosed, but it was some time in the autumn of 1898, and this suit was commenced on the 31st day of January, 1899. The defendant’s original answer set up by way of defense the failure to perform the contract, and by way of counterclaim sought to recover $1,100 which it had paid upon the price thereof, certain additional expense occasioned by delay in the delivery of the boiler, and additional expense for wages and fuel by reason of the necessity of running two boilers. In the course of the trial defendant announced that it preferred to stand simply upon its defense that plaintiff had not performed its contract, and therefore asked leave to withdraw its counterclaims, which was granted by the court. At the close of the evidence the court made findings to the effect that the contract was as above stated, and that the boiler put in, instead of being 50 per cent. greater capacity than the old one, was about 20 per cent. less capacity, and announced that upon the then state of the pleadings the defendant would be entitled to a judgment dismissing the complaint, but, on the theory that the defendant had offered some evidence of the reasonable value of the boiler and had accepted the same, the court entered an order that the plaintiff might amend his complaint by adding a count in <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>, and that the defendant might answer thereto simply by general denial, and could introduce no other defense, and that, when such pleadings were in, the action be postponed to the ensuing term, in order that evidence might be taken upon the new issue. To these orders the defendant took exception. The plaintiff did amend in the manner indicated, and the defendant introduced the only answer permitted—that of a general denial. Thereupon, at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page830" class="pagebreak">830</span>ensuing term, the plaintiff introduced evidence of experts of what it would cost to build such a boiler as that supplied to the defendant. Defendant offered no further evidence, except by way of cross-examination, to show by these experts that the boiler supplied would be worth approximately $1,800 less than a boiler of the capacity found to have been contracted for. Thereupon the court made findings that the plaintiff had substantially performed its contract, except that, instead of a boiler 50 per cent. greater than the old one, it had supplied one of about 20 per cent. less capacity; that defendant had accepted the boiler; and that the reasonable value thereof was the original contract price of $2,035, for which, less the payments, judgment was rendered, from which the defendant brings this appeal.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ D<small>ODGE</small>, J. (after stating the facts). The result of this action, whereby the defendant is required to pay the full contract price for a boiler of only about one-half the capacity or value of that for which it agreed to pay, is somewhat startling, especially in view of the consideration, understood by both parties, that its only reason for buying a new boiler at all was that the operation of the factory required more steam than the old one could supply. Before reaching such a result, a court should pause to re-examine the rules of law or processes of reasoning upon which it is based. If the law warrants it, the force or value of a contract seems to have vanished. The contractor receives the same compensation for nonperformance as for performance. The general rule of law is firmly established that he who makes an entire contract can recover no pay unless he performs it entirely and according to its terms. This general rule has, with considerable hesitation, been relaxed for equitable considerations in certain exceptional situations where it is believed to work hardship: First, in favor of laborers who contract to perform personal services, and without fault of either party fail to complete performance; secondly, in building contracts, where the contractor constructs something on the land of another which by oversight, but in good-faith effort to perform fails to entirely satisfy the contract, but is so substantially in compliance therewith that the structure fully accomplishes the purpose of that contracted for, and the other party voluntarily accepts the benefit thereof, or where the failure is mere inconsiderable incompleteness, and the expense of completion is easy of ascertainment; and, thirdly, where the contractor supplies an article different from or inferior to that promised, and the recipient, having full opportunity to reject without loss or injury, decides to accept and retain the thing furnished. This third phase is hardly an exception, for such voluntary acceptance may well be deemed the making of a new contract to take and pay reasonably for the article which does not satisfy the original contract. In case of either of these exceptions, great caution is due in order that the innocent purchaser shall not suffer. If loss must fall anywhere, it should rest on him who breaks the contract. As said in <span class="italic">Allen v. McKibbin</span>, and quoted approvingly in <span class="italic">Walsh v. Fisher</span>, “the party in default can never gain by his default, and the other party can never be permitted to lose by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page831" class="pagebreak">831</span>it.” The question, therefore, in such cases, is never what will reasonably compensate the contractor, but what can the purchaser pay without being put in worse position than if the contract had been performed? The recovery is quantum valebant from the innocent purchaser’s point of view.</p>
<p class="indent">Proceeding to ascertain how far these principles are applicable to the situation at bar, we are confronted by the fact that substantial performance of the express contract is wholly wanting. The finding is that the boiler furnished was about 82 per cent. of the capacity of the old one, instead of 150 per cent., and that the increase of capacity was the vital and essential part of the contract. This is in no sense substantial performance. The boiler does not serve at all the purpose which the larger one would have served, and for which it was purchased. Defendant can obtain that for which it contracted, and for which it agreed to pay $2,035, and which is necessary to the purpose which induced the contract, in only one of two ways: either it can remove this boiler from its premises at large expense, if plaintiff does not remove it, and purchase and put in place another of the required size; or it can retain it, and put in another of substantially equal capacity as auxiliary to it, and at a cost equal to or greater than the original contract price, and probably necessitating reconstruction of his boiler house. One in such predicament cannot be said to have received in substance that for which he contracted. Neither do we discover either finding or proof that defendant had accepted the boiler, had decided to keep it, and use it so far as it will go toward supplying the needed steam. True, the trial court argues that it would be inequitable to allow defendant to keep the boiler and pay nothing for it, but does not find that it has elected to do so. The only finding is that it is not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant rejected the boiler, or demanded its removal, though he did protest that it did not satisfy the contract. The evidence is that defendant never in words ordered plaintiff to remove the boiler, but from the testimony of the same witness (plaintiff’s manager) it appears that defendant, at the time of protesting the insufficiency, did convey to defendant its wish and expectation that it be removed. That witness testified that upon such protest he agreed that he would remove the boiler if on test it did not come up to contract requirement. The test was made, the capacity ascertained, but the plaintiff’s contention thereafter was that the contract was other than it is now found to have been, and for that reason did not remove it. This testimony fully confirms that of defendant’s manager that he desired to have the boiler removed, and negatives any inference that it remained on defendant’s premises pursuant to an election on its part to keep it…. Doubtless the fact, unexplained, that defendant made use of the boiler, which had been built into its boiler house and connected with the steam pipes in its factory, is an evidentiary circumstance having some tendency to show acceptance, but such conduct is by no means conclusive when a party cannot forego use of the appliance without at the same time giving up the use of his own premises. Thus one whose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page832" class="pagebreak">832</span>land has been plowed by another cannot be said to accept that plowing as a service merely because he sows seed and raises a crop on the land. Nor because a city runs sewerage through filter beds at its sewer outlet does it necessarily accept them. Nor because the owner lives in his house, and uses the defective furnace therein, does he necessarily accept the latter. Nor because one takes his own logs does he accept the cutting and driving done upon them by another. In <span class="italic">Smith v. School Dist.</span>, it was held sufficient to negative inference of acceptance of a school house that the district had “done nothing to prevent its removal by the builder.” From such considerations it is clear that the mere use of this boiler in connection with its own premises, with which it had been connected, is not enough to overcome the foregoing evidence that defendant up to the time of the trial had elected not to accept or retain the boiler, but wished it removed, and that plaintiff fully understood such election, and had allowed said boiler to remain in breach of its agreement to remove it, because of an erroneous construction of the contract. Further, at the close of the trial, before the amendments changing the cause of action, no evidence of the value of the boiler, in the sense above defined, had been received in evidence. The trial court seemed to hold that the contract price was prima facie proof of the value. We can hardly conceive a more complete solecism than the doctrine that the contract price of a 250 horse power boiler is presumptively the value of one of 140 horse power. If the contract price proves anything, it proves that the actual boiler was not worth $2,035, but some less sum….</p>
<p class="indent">The result is that at the close of the trial there was no evidence to support a recovery on the contract, and the court should have rendered judgment dismissing the complaint. Neither was there evidence to support a cause of action <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>, to accord with which amendment by the court is authorized by section 2830, Rev.St.1898. True, the court might conceive that acts subsequent to those disclosed by the proofs might take place, and might constitute acceptance; but could that justify an entire change of issues? The real controversy had been as to the capacity of the boiler contracted for. That issue being decided against it, different courses were open both to plaintiff and defendant. The former might decide to take it away and replace it by one up to the contract requirement, as it had promised to do; or perhaps it might enlarge this particular boiler, as suggested by the evidence; or it might take it away entirely, and stand its liability for damages for entire breach of the contract. The defendant might consent to any of these steps, or it might resist them in such a way as to effectively work an acceptance so as to be liable <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>. Indeed, so far as the record discloses, these options are still open to the parties, if not foreclosed by the judgment appealed from….</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded, with directions to enter judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>

<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1921.</p>
<p class="sectionb">230 N.Y. 239, 129 N.E. 889.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>ARDOZO</small>, J. The plaintiff built a country residence for the defendant at a cost of upwards of $77,000, and now sues to recover a balance of $3,483.46, remaining unpaid. The work of construction ceased in June, 1914, and the defendant then began to occupy the dwelling. There was no complaint of defective performance until March, 1915. One of the specifications for the plumbing work provides that—</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">All wrought-iron pipe must be well galvanized, lap welded pipe of the grade known as “standard pipe” of Reading manufacture.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant learned in March, 1915, that some of the pipe, instead of being made in Reading, was the product of other factories. The plaintiff was accordingly directed by the architect to do the work anew. The plumbing was then encased within the walls except in a few places where it had to be exposed. Obedience to the order meant more than the substitution of other pipe. It meant the demolition at great expense of substantial parts of the completed structure. The plaintiff left the work untouched and asked for a certificate that the final payment was due. Refusal of the certificate was followed by this suit.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence sustains a finding that the omission of the prescribed brand of pipe was neither fraudulent nor willful. It was the result of the oversight and inattention of the plaintiff’s subcontractor. Reading pipe is distinguished from Cohoes pipe and other brands only by the name of the manufacturer stamped upon it at intervals of between six and seven feet. Even the defendant’s architect, though he inspected the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page834" class="pagebreak">834</span>pipe upon arrival, failed to notice the discrepancy. The plaintiff tried to show that the brands installed, though made by other manufacturers, were the same in quality, in appearance, in market value, and in cost as the brand stated in the contract—that they were, indeed, the same thing, though manufactured in another place. The evidence was excluded, and a verdict directed for the defendant. The Appellate Division reversed, and granted a new trial.</p>
<p class="indent">We think the evidence, if admitted, would have supplied some basis for the inference that the defect was insignificant in its relation to the project. The courts never say that one who makes a contract fills the measure of his duty by less than full performance. They do say, however, that an omission, both trivial and innocent, will sometimes be atoned for by allowance of the resulting damage, and will not always be the breach of a condition to be followed by a forfeiture. The distinction is akin to that between dependent and independent promises, or between promises and conditions. Anson on Contracts (Corbin’s Ed.) § 367; 2 Williston on Contracts, § 842. Some promises are so plainly independent that they can never by fair construction be conditions of one another. Others are so plainly dependent that they must always be conditions. Others, though dependent and thus conditions when there is departure in point of substance, will be viewed as independent and collateral when the departure is insignificant. Considerations partly of justice and partly of presumable intention are to tell us whether this or that promise shall be placed in one class or in another. The simple and the uniform will call for different remedies from the multifarious and the intricate. The margin of departure within the range of normal expectation upon a sale of common chattels will vary from the margin to be expected upon a contract for the construction of a mansion or a “skyscraper.” There will be harshness sometimes and oppression in the implication of a condition when the thing upon which labor has been expended is incapable of surrender because united to the land, and equity and reason in the implication of a like condition when the subject-matter, if defective, is in shape to be returned. From the conclusion that promises may not be treated as dependent to the extent of their uttermost minutiae without a sacrifice of justice, the progress is a short one to the conclusion that they may not be so treated without a perversion of intention. Intention not otherwise revealed may be presumed to hold in contemplation the reasonable and probable. If something else is in view, it must not be left to implication. There will be no assumption of a purpose to visit venial faults with oppressive retribution.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who think more of symmetry and logic in the development of legal rules than of practical adaption to the attainment of a just result will be troubled by a classification where the lines of division are so wavering and blurred. Something, doubtless, may be said on the score of consistency and certainty in favor of a stricter standard. The courts have balanced such considerations against those of equity and fairness, and found the latter to be the weightier. The decisions in this state commit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page835" class="pagebreak">835</span>us to the liberal view, which is making its way, nowadays, in jurisdictions slow to welcome it. Where the line is to be drawn between the important and the trivial cannot be settled by a formula. “In the nature of the case precise boundaries are impossible.” 2 Williston on Contracts, § 841. The same omission may take on one aspect or another according to its setting. Substitution of equivalents may not have the same significance in fields of art on the one side and in those of mere utility on the other. Nowhere will change be tolerated, however, if it is so dominant or pervasive as in any real or substantial measure to frustrate the purpose of the contract. There is no general license to install whatever, in the builder’s judgment, may be regarded as “just as good.” The question is one of degree, to be answered, if there is doubt, by the triers of the facts, and, if the inferences are certain, by the judges of the law. We must weigh the purpose to be served, the desire to be gratified, the excuse for deviation from the letter, the cruelty of enforced adherence. Then only can we tell whether literal fulfillment is to be implied by law as a condition. This is not to say that the parties are not free by apt and certain words to effectuate a purpose that performance of every term shall be a condition of recovery. That question is not here. This is merely to say that the law will be slow to impute the purpose, in the silence of the parties, where the significance of the default is grievously out of proportion to the oppression of the forfeiture. The willful transgressor must accept the penalty of his transgression. For him there is no occasion to mitigate the rigor of implied conditions. The transgressor whose default is unintentional and trivial may hope for mercy if he will offer atonement for his wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">In the circumstances of this case, we think the measure of the allowance is not the cost of replacement, which would be great, but the difference in value, which would be either nominal or nothing. Some of the exposed sections might perhaps have been replaced at moderate expense. The defendant did not limit his demand to them, but treated the plumbing as a unit to be corrected from cellar to roof. In point of fact, the plaintiff never reached the stage at which evidence of the extent of the allowance became necessary. The trial court had excluded evidence that the defect was unsubstantial, and in view of that ruling there was no occasion for the plaintiff to go farther with an offer of proof. We think, however, that the offer, if it had been made, would not of necessity have been defective because directed to difference in value. It is true that in most cases the cost of replacement is the measure. The owner is entitled to the money which will permit him to complete, unless the cost of completion is grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the good to be attained. When that is true, the measure is the difference in value. Specifications call, let us say, for a foundation built of granite quarried in Vermont. On the completion of the building, the owner learns that through the blunder of a subcontractor part of the foundation has been built of granite of the same quality quarried in New Hampshire. The measure of allowance is not the cost of reconstruction.</p>

<p class="blockquote_ind">There may be omissions of that which could not afterwards be supplied exactly as called for by the contract without taking down the building to its foundations, and at the same time the omission may not affect the value of the building for use or otherwise, except so slightly as to be hardly appreciable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Handy v. Bliss</span>, 204 Mass. 513. The rule that gives a remedy in cases of substantial performance with compensation for defects of trivial or inappreciable importance has been developed by the courts as an instrument of justice. The measure of the allowance must be shaped to the same end.</p>
<p class="indent">The order should be affirmed, and judgment absolute directed in favor of the plaintiff upon the stipulation, with costs in all courts.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>C</small>L<small>AUGHLIN</small>, J. I dissent. The plaintiff did not perform its contract. Its failure to do so was either intentional or due to gross neglect which, under the uncontradicted facts, amounted to the same thing, nor did it make any proof of the cost of compliance, where compliance was possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Under its contract it obligated itself to use in the plumbing only pipe (between 2,000 and 2,500 feet) made by the Reading Manufacturing Company. The first pipe delivered was about 1,000 feet and the plaintiff’s superintendent then called the attention of the foreman of the subcontractor, who was doing the plumbing, to the fact that the specifications annexed to the contract required all pipe used in the plumbing to be of the Reading Manufacturing Company. They then examined it for the purpose of ascertaining whether this delivery was of that manufacture and found it was. Thereafter, as pipe was required in the progress of the work, the foreman of the subcontractor would leave word at its shop that he wanted a specified number of feet of pipe, without in any way indicating of what manufacture. Pipe would thereafter be delivered and installed in the building, without any examination whatever. Indeed, no examination, so far as appears, was made by the plaintiff, the subcontractor, defendant’s architect, or any one else, of any of the pipe except the first delivery, until after the building had been completed. Defendant’s architect then refused to give the certificate of completion, upon which the final payment depended, because all of the pipe used in the plumbing was not of the kind called for by the contract. After such refusal, the subcontractor removed the covering or insulation from about 900 feet of pipe which was exposed in the basement, cellar, and attic, and all but 70 feet was found to have been manufactured, not by the Reading Company, but by other manufacturers, some by the Cohoes Rolling Mill Company, some by the National Steel Works, some by the South Chester Tubing Company, and some which bore no manufacturer’s mark at all. The balance of the pipe had been so installed in the building that an inspection of it could not be had without demolishing, in part at least, the building itself.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page837" class="pagebreak">837</div>
<p class="indent">I am of the opinion the trial court was right in directing a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff agreed that all the pipe used should be of the Reading Manufacturing Company. Only about two-fifths of it, so far as appears, was of that kind. If more were used, then the burden of proving that fact was upon the plaintiff, which it could easily have done, since it knew where the pipe was obtained. The question of substantial performance of a contract of the character of the one under consideration depends in no small degree upon the good faith of the contractor. If the plaintiff had intended to, and had, complied with the terms of the contract except as to minor omissions, due to inadvertence, then he might be allowed to recover the contract price, less the amount necessary to fully compensate the defendant for damages caused by such omissions. But that is not this case. It installed between 2,000 and 2,500 feet of pipe, of which only 1,000 feet at most complied with the contract. No explanation was given why pipe called for by the contract was not used, nor that any effort made to show what it would cost to remove the pipe of other manufacturers and install that of the Reading Manufacturing Company. The defendant had a right to contract for what he wanted. He had a right before making payment to get what the contract called for. It is no answer to this suggestion to say that the pipe put in was just as good as that made by the Reading Manufacturing Company, or that the difference in value between such pipe and the pipe made by the Reading Manufacturing Company would be either “nominal or nothing.” Defendant contracted for pipe made by the Reading Manufacturing Company. What his reason was for requiring this kind of pipe is of no importance. He wanted that and was entitled to it. It may have been a mere whim on his part, but even so, he had a right to this kind of pipe, regardless of whether some other kind, according to the opinion of the contractor or experts, would have been “just as good, better, or done just as well.” He agreed to pay only upon condition that the pipe installed were made by that company and he ought not to be compelled to pay unless that condition be performed. The rule, therefore, of substantial performance, with damages for unsubstantial omissions, has no application.</p>
<p class="indent">What was said by this court in <span class="italic">Smith v. Brady</span>, is quite applicable here:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">I suppose it will be conceded that every one has a right to build his house, his cottage or his store after such a model and in such style as shall best accord with his notions of utility or be most agreeable to his fancy. The specifications of the contract become the law between the parties until voluntarily changed. If the owner prefers a plain and simple Doric column, and has so provided in the agreement, the contractor has no right to put in its place the more costly and elegant Corinthian. If the owner, having regard to strength and durability, has contracted for walls of specified materials to be laid in a particular manner, or for a given number of joists and beams, the builder has no right to substitute his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page838" class="pagebreak">838</span>own judgment or that of others. Having departed from the agreement, if performance has not been waived by the other party, the law will not allow him to allege that he has made as good a building as the one he engaged to erect. He can demand payment only upon and according to the terms of his contract, and if the conditions on which payment is due have not been performed, then the right to demand it does not exist. To hold a different doctrine would be simply to make another contract, and would be giving to parties an encouragement to violate their engagements, which the just policy of the law does not permit.</p>
<p class="indent">I am of the opinion the trial court did not err in ruling on the admission of evidence or in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>
<p class="indent">For the foregoing reasons I think the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the judgment of the Trial Term affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec429" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. On what theory was the plaintiff’s recovery based?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Conceding that the plaintiff was entitled to his contract price less damages, why weren’t the defendant’s damages measured by the cost to him of getting what his contract called for? Was substantial performance full performance here?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. If this had been a sales contract instead of a construction contract, with the plaintiff the seller and the defendant the buyer, and the seller had delivered Cohoes pipe instead of Reading, could the buyer have refused to take it? Would it have mattered that Cohoes pipe was “just as good” as Reading? Would the expense to the seller of delivering the wrong pipe have been considered relevant? If the buyer had taken it, what would he have had to pay for it? Why did buyer Kent have to pay for it here? Had he “taken” it?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. If Kent had been an officer of the Reading Manufacturing Company, same result?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Did the contractor know that he was installing the wrong pipe? Was his breach willful?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. If Cohoes pipe had not been “just as good” as Reading but had been serviceable pipe, would the court have reached the same result on the ground that the pipe installed in the house was “good enough”? Is 1½″ of terrazzo “just as good” as 2″ of terrazzo? Is it “good enough”? Good enough for what?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">7</span>. If the only thing wrong with the house was the color of the paint—cream instead of the white that the owner wanted—would builder be entitled to his full price because a cream colored house was just as valuable in the market as a white colored house?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page839" class="pagebreak">839</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">8</span>. If defaulting contractors may pursue a claim on the basis of <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> for partial performance, is there any need for the doctrine of substantial performance? Consider the court’s statement in <span class="italic">Kreyer v. Driscoll</span>, 159 N.W.2d 680 (Wis. 1968).</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">To recover on an uncompleted construction contract on a claim of having substantially, but not fully, performed it, the contractor must make a good faith effort to perform and substantially perform his agreement … .</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">[A] dispensation in favor of the contractor on the theory of substantial performance should be granted in cases of incompleteness only when such details are inconsiderable and not the fault of the contractor.</p>
<p class="indent">Finding that the contractor did not “substantially compl[y] with his contract to completely build a home according to plans and specifications,” the court concluded that the contractor is nevertheless entitled to be reimbursed for his services and materials on the basis of <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>. <span class="italic">See also Gentry v. Squires Constr.</span>, 188 S.W.3d 396, 404 (Tex. App. 2006) (holding that even though contractor did not substantially perform, he did partially perform, and homeowners benefited from that partial performance, so contractor could recover under <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>). Note that the availability of the <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> remedy for the defaulting contractor minimizes any unfairness that otherwise might result from a narrow view of substantial performance. Thus, substantial performance tends to assume more doctrinal significance in the minority-rule jurisdictions that refuse to recognize party-in-breach claims for restitution. On the other hand, in jurisdictions like California that liberally make available restitutionary remedies for defaulting parties, there is little reliance on the substantial performance doctrine.</p>

<p id="sec430" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Plante v. Jacobs</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Wisconsin Supreme Court, 1960.</p>
<p class="sectionb">10 Wis.2d 567, 103 N.W.2d 296.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ H<small>ALLOWS</small>, J. The defendants argue the plaintiff cannot recover any amount because he has failed to substantially perform the contract. The plaintiff conceded he failed to furnish the kitchen cabinets, gutters and downspouts, sidewalk, closet clothes poles, and entrance seat amounting to $1,601.95. This amount was allowed to the defendants. The defendants claim some 20 other items of incomplete or faulty performance by the plaintiff and no substantial performance because the cost of completing the house in strict compliance with the plans and specifications would amount to 25 or 30 per cent of the contract price. The defendants especially stress the misplacing of the wall between the living room and the kitchen, which narrowed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page840" class="pagebreak">840</span>the living room in excess of one foot. The cost of tearing down this wall and rebuilding it would be approximately $4,000. The record is not clear why and when this wall was misplaced, but the wall is completely built and the house decorated and the defendants are living therein. Real estate experts testified that the smaller width of the living room would not affect the market price of the house.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants rely on <span class="italic">Manitowoc Steam Boiler Works v. Manitowoc Glue Co.</span> for the proposition there can be no recovery on the contract as distinguished from <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> unless there is substantial performance. This is undoubtedly the correct rule at common law. For recovery on <span class="italic">quantum meruit,</span> see <span class="italic">Valentine v. Patrick Warren Construction Co.</span> The question here is whether there has been substantial performance. The test of what amounts to substantial performance seems to be whether the performance meets the essential purpose of the contract. In the <span class="italic">Manitowoc</span> case the contract called for a boiler having a capacity of 150 per cent of the existing boiler. The court held there was no substantial performance because the boiler furnished had a capacity of only 82 per cent of the old boiler and only approximately one-half of the boiler capacity contemplated by the contract. In <span class="italic">Houlahan v. Clark</span> the contract provided the plaintiff was to drive pilings in the lake and place a boat house thereon parallel and in line with a neighbor’s dock. This was not done and the contractor so positioned the boat house that it was practically useless to the owner. <span class="italic">Manthey v. Stock</span> involved a contract to paint a house and to do a good job, including the removal of the old paint where necessary. The plaintiff did not remove the old paint, and blistering and roughness of the new paint resulted. The court held that the plaintiff failed to show substantial performance. The defendants also cite <span class="italic">Manning v. School District No. 6</span>. However, this case involved a contract to install a heating and ventilating plant in the school building which would meet certain tests which the heating apparatus failed to do. The heating plant was practically a total failure to accomplish the purposes of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Substantial performance as applied to construction of a house does not mean that every detail must be in strict compliance with the specifications and the plans. Something less than perfection is the test of specific performance unless all details are made the essence of the contract. This was not done here. There may be situations in which features or details of construction of special or of great personal importance, which is not performed, would prevent a finding of substantial performance of the contract. In this case the plan was a stock floor plan. No detailed construction of the house was shown on the plan. There were no blueprints. The specifications were standard printed forms with some modifications and additions written in by the parties. Many of the problems that arose during the construction had to be solved on the basis of practical experience. No mathematical rule relating to the percentage of the price, of cost of completion or of completeness can be laid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page841" class="pagebreak">841</span>down to determine substantial performance of a building contract. Although the defendants received a house with which they are dissatisfied in many respects, the trial court was not in error in finding the contract was substantially performed.</p>
<p class="indent">The next question is what is the amount of recovery when the plaintiff has substantially, but incompletely, performed. For substantial performance the plaintiff should recover the contract price less the damages caused the defendant by the incomplete performance. Both parties agree. <span class="italic">Venzke v. Magdanz</span>, states the correct rule for damages due to faulty construction amounting to such incomplete performance, which is the difference between the value of the house as it stands with faulty and incomplete construction and the value of the house if it had been constructed in strict accordance with the plans and specifications. This is the diminished-value rule. The cost of replacement or repair is not the measure of such damage, but is an element to take into consideration in arriving at value under some circumstances. The cost of replacement or the cost to make whole the omissions may equal or be less than the difference in value in some cases and, likewise, the cost to rectify a defect may greatly exceed the added value to the structure as corrected. The defendants argue that under the <span class="italic">Venzke</span> rule their damages are $10,000. The plaintiff on review argues the defendants’ damages are only $650. Both parties agree the trial court applied the wrong rule to the facts.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court applied the cost-of-repair or replacement rule as to several items, relying on <span class="italic">Stern v. Schlafer</span> wherein it was stated that when there are a number of small items of defect or omission which can be remedied without the reconstruction of a substantial part of the building or a great sacrifice of work or material already wrought in the building, the reasonable cost of correcting the defect should be allowed. However, in <span class="italic">Mohs v. Quarton</span>, the court held when the separation of defects would lead to confusion, the rule of diminished value could apply to all defects.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case no such confusion arises in separating the defects. The trial court disallowed certain claimed defects because they were not proven. This finding was not against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence and will not be disturbed on appeal. Of the remaining defects claimed by the defendants, the court allowed the cost of replacement or repair except as to the misplacement of the living-room wall. Whether a defect should fall under the cost-of-replacement rule or be considered under the diminished-value rule depends upon the nature and magnitude of the defect. This court has not allowed items of such magnitude under the cost-of-repair rule as the trial court did. Viewing the construction of the house as a whole and its cost we cannot say, however, that the trial court was in error in allowing the cost of repairing the plaster cracks in the ceilings, the cost of mud jacking and repairing the patio floor, and the cost of reconstructing the non-weight-bearing and nonstructural patio wall. Such reconstruction did not involve an unreasonable economic waste.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page842" class="pagebreak">842</div>
<p class="indent">The item of misplacing the living room wall under the facts of this case was clearly under the diminished-value rule. There is no evidence that defendants requested or demanded the replacement of the wall in the place called for by the specifications during the course of construction. To tear down the wall now and rebuild it in its proper place would involve a substantial destruction of the work, if not all of it, which was put into the wall and would cause additional damage to other parts of the house and require replastering and redecorating the walls and ceilings of at least two rooms. Such economic waste is unreasonable and unjustified. The rule of diminished value contemplates the wall is not going to be moved. Expert witnesses for both parties, testifying as to the value of the house, agreed that the misplacement of the wall had no effect on the market price. The trial court properly found that the defendants suffered no legal damage, although the defendants’ particular desire for specified room size was not satisfied. For a discussion of these rules of damages for defective or unfinished construction and their application see Restatement, Contracts, sec. 346(1)(a) and illustrations.</p>

<p class="indent">In many deals that go sour, the non-breaching party gets clear notice in advance that it is not going to get the future performance it bargained for. Sometimes this notice comes in the form of an express statement by the promisor. Sometimes—as in the case of installment contracts—the party gets that “notice” by a breach of an early installment so material that he is justified in inferring that the breaching party has no intention of properly performing future duties or no ability to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">What effect should be given to an advance notice of intention not to perform? This event is usually labeled “anticipatory repudiation.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_153" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-153" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a></span></sup> How can there be a breach of a duty before it is due?</p>

<p class="blockquote_ind">The real sanctity of any contract rests only in the mutual willingness of the parties to perform.

Generally speaking, it is far better in such a situation, for the individuals and for society, that the rights and obligations between them should be promptly and definitely settled, if the injured party so desires, unless there is some provision in the contract that, as a matter of mutual intention, can be said to prevent this from being done. The commercial world has long since learned the desirability of fixing its liabilities and losses as quickly as possible, and the law similarly needs to remind itself that, to be useful, it too must seek to be practical.</p>

<p class="indent">The substantial practical reason for permitting the aggrieved promisee to sue at once for anticipatory repudiation is that allowing an action at once tends to conserve available resources and prevent waste. If no legal recognition is extended to the promisee’s valuable contractual relation pending performance, if no cause of action is recognized until there is a failure to perform at the time for performance, large losses may be incurred which suing promptly might avoid. Merely recognizing repudiation as an excuse to the aggrieved party for future non-performance is not enough since frequently there is a dispute over who is in the wrong which only litigation can settle. Unless the aggrieved promisee can at once come to court in an action for anticipatory repudiation he must either struggle on with hostile or possibly insolvent parties, incurring expense and loss of time in preparations which may be of no use to anybody, or he must cease such further preparations for performance at the peril of being found in default after all in later litigation at the time for performance. In long-time contracts which now in the business world are becoming more and more important, the importance of getting a reasonably prompt settlement of controversies over repudiation is hard to exaggerate. Very often by such settlement through litigation, the controversy can be adjusted and the productive work of the business in hand continued without serious interruption.</p>
<p class="indent">Even should the law’s delays through appeals to the higher courts absorb more than the time outstanding between repudiation and the date for performance the general consideration of conserving available resources and avoiding waste continues applicable in favor of an immediate action for the repudiation. The sooner the controversy can be disposed of the sooner the parties can know their obligations and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page844" class="pagebreak">844</span>the sooner they can in accordance therewith adjust their affairs to practical productive efforts, instead of remaining idle or engaging in misdirected futile activity while awaiting the results of distant future litigation.</p>

<p class="sectionb">Queen’s Bench, 1853.</p>
<p class="sectionb">2 Ellis &amp; Bl. 678, 118 Eng.Rep. 922.</p>
<p class="indent">Action of assumpsit.</p>
<p class="indent">On the trial before Erle, J., at the London sittings in last Easter Term, it appeared that plaintiff was a courier, who in April, 1852, was engaged by defendant to accompany him on a tour, to commence on 1st June, 1852, on the terms mentioned in the declaration. On the 11th May, 1852, defendant wrote to plaintiff that he had changed his mind, and declined his services. He refused to make him any compensation. The action was commenced on 22d May. The plaintiff, between the commencement of the action and the 1st of June, obtained an engagement with Lord Ashburton, on equally good terms, but not commencing till July 4th. The defendant’s counsel objected that there could be no breach of the contract before the 1st of June. The learned judge was of a contrary opinion, but reserved leave to enter a nonsuit on this objection. The other questions were left to the jury, who found for plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">Hugh Hill, in the same term, obtained a rule nisi to enter a nonsuit or arrest the judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ L<small>ORD</small> C<small>AMPBELL</small>, C.J., now delivered the judgment of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">On this motion in arrest of judgment, the question arises, Whether, if there be an agreement between A and B, whereby B engages to employ A on and from a future day for a given period of time, to travel with him into a foreign country as a courier, and to start with him in that capacity on that day, A being to receive a monthly salary during the continuance of such service, B may, before the day, refuse to perform the agreement and break and renounce it, so as to entitle A before the day to commence an action against B to recover damages for breach of the agreement; A having been ready and willing to perform it, till it was broken and renounced by B. The defendant’s counsel very powerfully contended that, if the plaintiff was not contented to dissolve the contract and to abandon all remedy upon it, he was bound to remain ready and willing to perform it till the day when the actual employment as courier in the service of the defendant was to begin; and that there could be no breach of the agreement before that day to give a right of action. But it cannot be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page845" class="pagebreak">845</span>laid down as a universal rule that, whereby agreement an act is to be done on a future day, no action can be brought for a breach of the agreement till the day for doing the act has arrived. If a man promises to marry a woman on a future day, and before that day marries another woman, he is instantly liable to an action for breach of promise of marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">If a man contracts to execute a lease on and from a future day for a certain term, and before that day executes a lease to another for the same term, he may be immediately sued for breaking the contract. So, if a man contracts to sell and deliver specific goods on a future day, and before the day he sells and delivers them to another, he is immediately liable to an action at the suit of the person with whom he first contracted to sell and deliver them. One reason alleged in support of such an action is, that the defendant has, before the day, rendered it impossible for him to perform the contract at the day, but this does not necessarily follow; for prior to the day fixed for doing the act, the first wife may have died, a surrender of the lease executed might be obtained, and the defendant might have repurchased the goods so as to be in a situation to sell and deliver them to the plaintiff. Another reason may be that, where there is a contract to do an act on a future day, there is a relation constituted between the parties in the meantime by the contract, and that they impliedly promise that in the meantime neither will do anything to the prejudice of the other inconsistent with that relation. As for example, a man and woman engaged to marry are affianced to one another during the period between the time of the engagement and the celebration of the marriage. In this very case of traveller and courier, from the day of the hiring till the day when the employment was to begin, they were engaged to each other; and it seems to be a breach of an implied contract if either of them renounces the engagement. This reasoning seems in accordance with the unanimous decision of the Exchequer Chamber in <span class="italic">Elderton v. Emmens</span>, which we have followed in subsequent cases in this court.</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration in the present case, in alleging a breach, states a great deal more than a passing intention on the part of the defendant which he may repent of, and could only be proved by evidence that he had utterly renounced the contract, or done some act which rendered it impossible for him to perform it. If the plaintiff has no remedy for breach of the contract unless he treats the contract as in force, and acts upon it down to June 1st, 1852, it follows that, till then, he must enter into no employment which will interfere with his promise “to start with the defendant on such travels on the day and year,” and that he must then be properly equipped in all respects as a courier for a three months’ tour on the continent of Europe. But it is surely much more rational, and more for the benefit of both parties, that, after the renunciation of the agreement by the defendant, the plaintiff should be at liberty to consider himself absolved from any future performance of it, retaining his right to sue for any damage he has suffered from the breach of it. Thus, instead of remaining <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page846" class="pagebreak">846</span>idle and laying out money in preparations which must be useless, he is at liberty to seek service under another employer, which would go in mitigation of the damages to which he would otherwise be entitled for a breach of the contract. It seems strange that the defendant, after renouncing the contract, and absolutely declaring that he will never act under it, should be permitted to object that faith is given to his assertion, and that an opportunity is not left to him of changing his mind.</p>
<p class="indent">If the plaintiff is barred of any remedy by entering into an engagement inconsistent with starting as a courier with the defendant on the 1st June, he is prejudiced by putting faith in the defendant’s assertion; and it would be more consistent with principle, if the defendant were precluded from saying that he had not broken the contract when he declared that he entirely renounced it.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose that the defendant, at the time of his renunciation, had embarked on a voyage for Australia, so as to render it physically impossible for him to employ the plaintiff as a courier on the continent of Europe in the months of June, July and August, 1852; according to decided cases, the action might have been brought before the 1st June; but the renunciation may have been founded on other facts, to be given in evidence, which would equally have rendered the defendant’s performance of the contract impossible. The man who wrongfully renounces a contract into which he has deliberately entered cannot justly complain if he is immediately sued for a compensation in damages by the man whom he has injured; and it seems reasonable to allow an option to the injured party, either to sue immediately, or to wait till the time when the act was to be done, still holding it as prospectively binding for the exercise of this option, which may be advantageous to the innocent party, and cannot be prejudicial to the wrong-doer. An argument against the action before the 1st of June is urged from the difficulty of calculating the damages; but this argument is equally strong against an action before the 1st of September, when the three months would expire. In either case, the jury in assessing the damages would be justified in looking to all that happened, or was likely to happen, to increase or mitigate the loss of the plaintiff down to the day of trial. We do not find any decision contrary to the view we are taking of this case….</p>
<p class="indent">The only other case cited in the argument which we think it necessary to notice is <span class="italic">Planchè v. Colburn</span>, which appears to be an authority for the plaintiff. There the defendants had engaged the plaintiff to write a treatise for a periodical publication. The plaintiff commenced the composition of the treatise; but, before he had completed it, and before the time when in the course of conducting the publication it would have appeared in print, the publication was abandoned. The plaintiff thereupon, without completing the treatise, brought an action for breach of contract. Objection was made that the plaintiff could not recover on the special contract for want of having completed, tendered, and delivered the treatise, according to the contract. Tindal, C.J., said: “The fact was, that the defendants not only suspended, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page847" class="pagebreak">847</span>but actually put an end to, ‘The Juvenile Library’; they had broken their contract with the plaintiff.” The declaration contained counts for work and labour: but the plaintiff appears to have retained his verdict on the count framed on the special contract, thus showing that, in the opinion of the court, the plaintiff might treat the renunciation of the contract by the defendants as a breach, and maintain an action for that breach, without considering that it remained in force so as to bind him to perform his part of it before bringing an action for the breach of it. If it should be held that, upon a contract to do an act on a future day, a renunciation of the contract by one party dispenses with a condition to be performed in the meantime by the other, there seems no reason for requiring that other to wait till the day arrives before seeking his remedy by action, and the only ground on which the condition can be dispensed with seems to be that the renunciation may be treated as a breach of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon the whole, we think that the declaration in this case is sufficient. It gives us great satisfaction to reflect that, the question being on the record, our opinion may be reviewed in a court of error. In the meantime we must give judgment for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. If Hochster had died on May 20, after De La Tour’s anticipatory repudiation of May 11, would his estate have been entitled to the contract price for his services? Would it have been entitled to damages? What if he had died on June 20? Suppose that De La Tour had discharged him without cause on June 2, and he died on June 20. What then?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If early in a contract, one party plainly repudiates his total duty, as Baron De La Tour did, there is no doubt that the repudiation can be safely treated as a total breach. But what if the Baron had merely notified Hochster in advance that—contrary to the contract’s terms—he would have to provide his own horse. If this would not be a material breach if the notice were given when Hochster first appeared for work (and it might well not be so considered), would it still be an anticipatory repudiation if given two weeks in advance? Could Hochster refuse to report for work? Could he take another job?</p>

<p id="sec437" class="noindent">P<small>HILLIPS</small>, J., in <span class="italic">Bu–Vi–Bar Petroleum Corp. v. Krow</span>, 40 F.2d 488, 492 (10th Cir. 1930):</p>
<p class="indent">The situation of the injured party, where there has been a breach which does not indicate an intention to repudiate the remainder of the contract, and the situation of the injured party, where there has been a total renunciation of the contract, differs in important particulars. In the former case, the injured party has a genuine election either of continuing performance or ceasing to perform. Any act, indicating an intent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page849" class="pagebreak">849</span>to continue, will operate as a conclusive election. On the other hand, where the contract is wholly renounced, there can be no real election between continuation and cessation of performance, because, after notice of renunciation, the other party cannot go on and complete an executory contract and sue for any increased damages resulting from his continuing to perform.</p>
<p class="indent">A continued willingness upon the part of the injured party to receive performance is an indication that, if the repudiator will withdraw his repudiation, but not otherwise, the contract may proceed. It is not an irrevocable election not to treat the renunciation as a breach. The refusal to retract amounts to a continuation of such renunciation….</p>
<p class="indent">We are not unmindful that the above statement is contrary to the English doctrine, which is that if the promisee, after receiving the repudiation, demands or manifests a willingness to receive performance “he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the others as well as his own; he remains subject to all his own obligations and liabilities under it, and enables the other party not only to complete the contract, if so advised, notwithstanding his previous repudiation of it, but also to take advantage of any supervening circumstance which would justify him in declining to complete it.” <span class="italic">Frost v. Knight</span>, L.R. 7 Ex. 111, 112; Williston on Contracts, vol. III, pp. 2386, 2387.</p>
<p class="indent">But this harsh and unreasonable doctrine is modified by the American authorities, at least to the extent that so long as the party who has repudiated, notwithstanding requests for retraction and performance upon the part of the other party, refuses to retract and thus continues his repudiation without justification, the latter, if not in default himself, may still elect to treat the repudiation as a breach.</p>

<p class="sectionb">California Supreme Court, 1975.</p>
<p class="sectionb">15 Cal.3d 130, 123 Cal.Rptr. 641, 539 P.2d 425.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>ULLIVAN</small>, J. In this action for damages for breach of contract defendants Elizabeth and Ellwood Johnston, individually and as copartners doing business as Old English Rancho, appeal from a judgment entered after a nonjury trial in favor of plaintiff H.B. Taylor and against them in the amount of $132,778.05 and costs.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff was engaged in the business of owning, breeding, raising and racing thoroughbred horses in Los Angeles County. Defendants were engaged in a similar business, and operated a horse farm in Ontario, California, where they furnished stallion stud services. In January 1965 plaintiff sought to breed his two thoroughbred mares, Sunday Slippers and Sandy Fork to defendants’ stallion Fleet Nasrullah. To that end, on January 19 plaintiff and defendants entered into two separate written contracts—one pertaining to Sunday Slippers and the other to Sandy Fork. Except for the mare involved the contracts were identical. We set forth in the margin the contract covering Sunday Slippers.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_154" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-154" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page851" class="pagebreak">851</div>
<p class="indent">The contract provided that Fleet Nasrullah was to perform breeding services upon the respective mares in the year 1966 for a fee of $3,500, payable on or before September 1, 1966. If the stud fee was paid in full and the mares failed to produce a live foal (one that stands and nurses without assistance) from the breeding a return breeding would be provided the following year without additional fee.</p>
<p class="indent">On October 4, 1965, defendants sold Fleet Nasrullah to Dr. A.G. Pessin and Leslie Combs II for $1,000,000 cash and shipped the stallion to Kentucky. Subsequently Combs and Pessin syndicated the sire by selling various individuals 36 or 38 shares, each share entitling the holder to breed one mare each season to Fleet Nasrullah. Combs and Pessin each reserved three shares.</p>
<p class="indent">On the same day defendants wrote to plaintiff advising the latter of the sale and that he was “released” from his “reservations” for Fleet Nasrullah. Unable to reach defendants by telephone, plaintiff had his attorney write to them on October 8, 1965, insisting on performance of the contracts. Receiving no answer, plaintiff’s attorney on October 19 wrote a second letter threatening suit. On October 27, defendants advised plaintiff by letter that arrangements had been made to breed the two mares to Fleet Nasrullah in Kentucky. However, plaintiff later learned that the mares could not be boarded at Spendthrift Farm where Fleet Nasrullah was standing stud and accordingly arranged with Clinton Frazier of Elmhurst Farm to board the mares and take care of the breeding.</p>
<p class="indent">In January 1966 plaintiff shipped Sunday Slippers and Sandy Fork to Elmhurst Farm. At that time, however, both mares were in foal and could not be bred, since this can occur only during the five-day period in which they are in heat. The first heat period normally occurs nine days, and the second heat period thirty days, after foaling. Succeeding heat periods occur every 21 days.</p>
<p class="indent">On April 17, 1966, Sunday Slippers foaled and Frazier immediately notified Dr. Pessin. The latter assured Frazier that he would make the necessary arrangements to breed the mare to Fleet Nasrullah. On April 26, the ninth day after the foaling, Frazier, upon further inquiry, was told by Dr. Pessin to contact Mrs. Judy who had charge of booking the breedings and had handled these matters with Frazier in the past. Mrs. Judy, however, informed Frazier that the stallion was booked for that day but would be available on any day not booked by a shareholder. She indicated that she was acting under instructions but suggested that he keep in touch with her while the mare was in heat.</p>
<p class="indent">Sunday Slippers came into heat again on May 13, 1966. Frazier telephoned Mrs. Judy and attempted to book the breeding for May 16.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_155" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-155" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> She informed him that Fleet <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page852" class="pagebreak">852</span>Nasrullah had been reserved by one of the shareholders for that day, but that Frazier should keep in touch with her in the event the reservation was cancelled. On May 14 and May 15 Frazier tried again but without success; on the latter date, Sunday Slippers went out of heat.</p>
<p class="indent">On June 4, the mare went into heat again. Frazier again tried to book a reservation with Fleet Nasrullah but was told that all dates during the heat period had been already booked. He made no further efforts but on June 7, on plaintiff’s instructions, bred Sunday Slippers to a Kentucky Derby winner named Chateaugay for a stud fee of $10,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Sandy Fork, plaintiff’s other mare awaiting the stud services of Fleet Nasrullah, foaled on June 5, 1966. Frazier telephoned Mrs. Judy the next day and received a booking to breed the mare on June 14, the ninth day after foaling. On June 13, 1966, however, she cancelled the reservation because of the prior claim of a shareholder. Frazier made no further attempts and on June 14 bred Sandy Fork to Chateaugay.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly after their breeding, it was discovered that both mares were pregnant with twins. In thoroughbred racing twins are considered undesirable since they endanger the mare and are themselves seldom valuable for racing. Both mares were therefore aborted. However, plaintiff was not required to pay the $20,000 stud fees for Chateaugay’s services because neither mare delivered a live foal.</p>
<p class="indent">The instant action for breach of contract proceeded to trial on plaintiff’s fourth amended complaint, which alleged two causes of action, the first for breach of the two written contracts, the second for breach of an oral agreement. Defendants’ cross-complained for the stud fees. The court found the facts to be substantially as stated above and further found and concluded that by selling Fleet Nasrullah defendants had “put it out of their power to perform properly their contracts,” that the conduct of defendants and their agents Dr. Pessin and Mrs. Judy up to and including June 13, 1966, constituted a breach<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_156" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-156" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup> and plaintiff “was then justified in treating it as a breach and repudiation of their contractual obligations to him,” and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page853" class="pagebreak">853</span>that defendants unjustifiably breached the contracts but plaintiff did not.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_157" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-157" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></sup> The court awarded plaintiff damages for defendants’ breach in the sum of $103,122.50 ($99,800 net damage directly sustained plus $3,322.50 for reasonable costs and expenses for mitigation of damages). “Because of defendants’ wholly unwarranted, high-handed, and oppressive breach of their contractual obligation to plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants pre-judgment interest at the rate of 7% per annum on the sum of $99,800.00 from August 1, 1968 * * *.” It was concluded that defendants should take nothing on their cross-complaint. Judgment was entered accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants’ main attack on the judgment is two-pronged. They contend: first, that they did not at any time repudiate the contracts; and second, that they did not otherwise breach the contracts because performance was made impossible by plaintiff’s own actions. To put it another way, defendants argue in effect that the finding that they breached the contracts is without any support in the evidence. Essentially they take the position that on the uncontradicted evidence in the record, as a matter of law there was neither anticipatory nor actual breach. As will appear, we conclude that the trial court’s decision was based solely on findings of anticipatory breach and that we must determine whether such decision is supported by the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless both aspects of defendants’ argument require us at the outset to examine the specifications for performance contained in the contracts. (<span class="italic">See</span> fn. 1, <span class="italic">ante</span>.) We note that the reservation for “one services” for Fleet Nasrullah was “for the year 1966.” As the evidence showed, a breeding is biologically possible throughout the calendar year, since mares regularly come into heat every 21 days, unless they are pregnant. The contracts therefore appear to contemplate breeding with Fleet Nasrullah at any time during the calendar year 1966. The trial court made no finding as to the time of performance called for by the contracts.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_158" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-158" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></sup> There was testimony to the effect that by custom in the thoroughbred racing business the breeding is consummated in a “breeding season” which normally extends from January until early July, although some breeding continues through August. It is possible that the parties intended that the mares be bred to Fleet Nasrullah during the 1966 breeding season rather than the calendar year 1966.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_159" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-159" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page854" class="pagebreak">854</div>
<p class="indent">However, in our view, it is immaterial whether the contract phrase “for the year 1966” is taken to mean the above breeding season or the full calendar year since in either event the contract period had not expired by June 7 and June 14, 1966, the dates on which Sunday Slippers and Sandy Fork respectively were bred to Chateaugay<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_160" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-160" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup> and by which time, according to the findings defendants had repudiated the contracts. There can be no <span class="italic">actual</span> breach of a contract until the time specified therein for performance has arrived. Although there may be a <span class="italic">breach by anticipatory repudiation:</span> “[b]y its very name an essential element of a true anticipatory breach of a contract is that the repudiation by the promisor occur before his performance is due under the contract.” In the instant case, because under either of the above interpretations the time for performance has not yet arrived, defendants’ breach as found by the trial court was of necessity an anticipatory breach and must be analyzed in accordance with the principles governing such type of breach. To these principles we now direct our attention.</p>
<p class="indent">Anticipatory breach occurs when one of the parties to a bilateral contract repudiates the contract. The repudiation may be express or implied. An express repudiation is a clear, positive, unequivocal refusal to perform; an implied repudiation results from conduct where the promisor puts it out of his power to perform so as to make substantial performance of his promise impossible.</p>
<p class="indent">When a promisor repudiates a contract, the injured party faces an election of remedies: he can treat the repudiation as an anticipatory breach and immediately seek damages for breach of contract, thereby terminating the contractual relation between the parties, or he can treat the repudiation as an empty threat, wait until the time for performance arrives and exercise his remedies for actual breach if a breach does in fact occur at such time. However, if the injured party disregards the repudiation and treats the contract as still in force, and the repudiation is retracted prior to the time of performance, then the repudiation is nullified and the injured party is left with his remedies, if any, invocable at the time of performance.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have pointed out, the trial court found that the whole course of conduct of defendants and their agents Dr. Pessin and Mrs. Judy from the time of the sale of Fleet Nasrullah up to and including June 13, 1966, amounted to a repudiation which plaintiff was justified in treating as an anticipatory breach. However, when the principles of law governing repudiation just described are applied to the facts constituting this course of conduct as found by the trial court, it is manifest that such conduct cannot be treated as an undifferentiated continuum amounting to a single repudiation but must be divided into two separate repudiations.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page855" class="pagebreak">855</div>
<p class="indent">First, defendants clearly repudiated the contracts when, after selling Fleet Nasrullah and shipping him to Kentucky, they informed plaintiff “[y]ou are, therefore, released from your reservations made to the stallion.” However, the trial court additionally found that “[p]laintiff did not wish to be ‘released’ from his ‘reservations’ * * * insist[ed] on performance of the stud service agreements * * * [and] threaten[ed] litigation if the contracts were not honored by defendants * * *.” Accordingly defendants arranged for performance of the contracts by making Fleet Nasrullah available for stud service to plaintiff in Kentucky through their agents Dr. Pessin and Mrs. Judy. Plaintiff elected to treat the contracts as in force and shipped the mares to Kentucky to effect the desired performance. The foregoing facts lead us to conclude that the subsequent arrangements by defendants to make Fleet Nasrullah available to service plaintiff’s mares in Kentucky constituted a retraction of the repudiation. Since at this time plaintiff had not elected to treat the repudiation as an anticipatory breach<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_161" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-161" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span></sup> and in fact had shipped the mares to Kentucky in reliance on defendants’ arrangements, this retraction nullified the repudiation. Thus, plaintiff was then left with his remedies that might arise at the time of performance.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court found that after the mares had arrived in Kentucky, had delivered the foals they were then carrying and were ready for servicing by Fleet Nasrullah, plaintiff was justified in concluding from the conduct of defendants, their agent Dr. Pessin, and their subagent Mrs. Judy, that “defendants were just giving him the runaround and had no intention of performing their contract in the manner required by its terms” and in treating such conduct “as a breach and repudiation of their contractual obligation to him.” Since, as we have explained, defendants retracted their original repudiation, this subsequent conduct amounts to a finding of a second repudiation.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no evidence in the record that defendants or their agents Dr. Pessin and Mrs. Judy ever stated that Sunday Slippers and Sandy Fork would not be serviced by Fleet Nasrullah during the 1966 breeding season or that they ever refused to perform. Frazier, plaintiff’s agent who made arrangements for the breeding of the mares admitted that they had never made such a statement to him.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_162" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-162" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></sup> Accordingly, there was no <span class="italic">express</span> repudiation or unequivocal refusal to perform.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court’s finding of repudiation, expressly based on the “conduct of the defendants” and their agents suggests that the court found an implied repudiation. However, there is no implied repudiation, i.e., by conduct equivalent to unequivocal refusal to perform, unless “the promisor <span class="italic">puts it out of his power to perform.</span>” Once the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page856" class="pagebreak">856</span>mares arrived in Kentucky, defendants had the power to perform the contracts; Fleet Nasrullah could breed with the mares. No subsequent conduct occurred to render this performance impossible. Although plaintiff was subordinated to the shareholders with respect to the priority of reserving a breeding time with Fleet Nasrullah, there is no evidence in the record that this subordination of reservation rights rendered performance impossible. Rather it acted to postpone the time of performance, which still remained within the limits prescribed by the contracts. It rendered performance more difficult to achieve; it may even have cast doubt upon the eventual accomplishment of performance; it did not render performance impossible.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_163" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-163" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Because there was no repudiation, express or implied, there was no anticipatory breach. Plaintiff contends that defendants’ conduct, as found by the trial court, indicated that “defendants were just giving him the runaround and had no intention of performing their contract” and therefore that this conduct was the equivalent of an express and unequivocal refusal to perform. Plaintiff has not presented to the court any authority in California in support of his proposition that conduct which has not met the test for an implied repudiation, i.e. conduct which removed the power to perform, may nonetheless be held to amount to the equivalent of an express repudiation and thus constitute an anticipatory breach. Without addressing ourselves to the question whether some conduct could ever be found equal to an express repudiation, we hold that defendants’ conduct in this case as a matter of law did not constitute an anticipatory breach.</p>
<p class="indent">To constitute an express repudiation, the promisor’s statement, or in this case conduct, must amount to an unequivocal refusal to perform: “A mere declaration, however, of a party of an intention not to be bound will not of itself amount to a breach, so as to create an effectual renunciation of the contract; for one party cannot by any act or declaration destroy the binding force and efficacy of the contract. To justify the adverse party in treating the renunciation as a breach, the refusal to perform must be of the whole contract * * * and must be distinct, unequivocal and absolute.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page857" class="pagebreak">857</div>
<p class="indent">To recapitulate, Sandy Fork was in foal in January 1966, the commencement of the 1966 breeding season, and remained so until June 5, 1966. Throughout this period Fleet Nasrullah could not perform his services as contracted due solely to the conduct of plaintiff in breeding Sandy Fork in 1965. Biologically the first opportunity to breed Sandy Fork was on June 14, 1966, nine days after foaling. Frazier telephoned Mrs. Judy on June 6, 1966, and received a booking with Fleet Nasrullah for June 14, 1966. On June 13 Mrs. Judy telephoned Frazier and informed him she would have to cancel Sandy Fork’s reservation for the following day because one of the shareholders insisted on using that day. Mrs. Judy gave no indication whatsoever that she could not or would not breed Sandy Fork on any of the following days in that heat period or subsequent heat periods. Frazier made no further attempts to breed Sandy Fork with Fleet Nasrullah. Thus, plaintiff, who delayed the possibility of performance for five months, asserts that the delay of performance occasioned by defendants’ cancellation of a reservation on the first day during the six-month period that plaintiff made performance possible amounts to an unequivocal refusal to perform, even though there was adequate opportunity for Fleet Nasrullah to perform within the period for performance specified in the contract and even though defendants never stated any intention not to perform. We conclude that as a matter of law this conduct did not amount to an unequivocal refusal to perform and therefore did not constitute an anticipatory breach of the contract covering Sandy Fork.</p>
<p class="indent">Sunday Slippers foaled on April 17, 1966, first came into heat on April 26 and then successively on May 13 and June 4, 1966. Mrs. Judy informed Frazier that she would breed Sunday Slippers on any day that one of the shareholders did not want to use the stallion. Frazier unsuccessfully sought to breed the mare on April 26, May 14, May 15 and June 4, 1966, Fleet Nasrullah being reserved on those dates. Mrs. Judy continued to assure Frazier that the breeding would occur. Sunday Slippers was due to come into heat again twice during the breeding season: June 25 and July 16, 1966. At most this conduct amounts to delay of performance and a warning that performance might altogether be precluded if a shareholder were to desire Fleet Nasrullah’s services on all the remaining days within the period specified for performance in which Sunday Slippers was in heat. We conclude that as a matter of law this conduct did not amount to an unequivocal refusal to perform and therefore did not constitute an anticipatory breach of the contract covering Sunday Slippers.</p>

<p id="sec441" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON FLEET NASRULLAH</span></p>
<p class="indent">A first-year law student may find it hard to be aware of the life behind the cold print of a case report. The racing and romantic life of Fleet Nasrullah, the stallion in <span class="italic">Taylor v. Johnston</span>, was summarized in an obituary of this remarkable creature by Leon Rasmussen in the <span class="italic">Daily Racing Form</span> of February 3, 1979:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Fleet Nasrullah, who passed away in his paddock at Spendthrift the other day at age 24, was one of this observer’s all-time favorite race horses and sires. He was practically invincible while sprinting, and yet he had enough speed to stay 1⅛ miles on the grass in American record time. He lost the 1¼–mile Santa Anita Handicap in a photo while never changing leads throughout the race. At stud he sired 41 stakes winners (SWs) and his runners are closing in on $10,000,000 in purse earnings.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">…</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Unquestionably, Fleet Nasrullah’s name is destined to live on in quality pedigrees on both sides of the family.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">That is the way it should be because he was some kind of horse.</p>
<p class="blockquote">*    I remember Ellwood Johnston saying after Fleet Nasrullah captured the 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> mile San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita in 1:41⅖, the fastest time at the distance at the track in three years, “he has more sheer speed than any Nasrullah alive. I wouldn’t sell him for a million dollars (this was 1960).”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Eddie Arcaro was one dissenter regarding Fleet Nasrullah being the fastest son of Nasrullah, insisting, “I don’t know of any Nasrullah that had more speed than Bold Ruler.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The comparison hardly belittles either horse and since Bold Ruler went on to become our premier sire on eight occasions, Arcaro’s opinion must be given <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page859" class="pagebreak">859</span>the edge. In any case it makes a good case for speed in the sire as both these brilliant sons of Nasrullah made lasting names for themselves at stud.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Johnston obtained Fleet Nasrullah from John Hertz for a bargain-basement price of $150,000. This reporter remembers telling him that the price was ridiculously low. He replied: “In my many years of racing I’ve only had one losing season. If I sell Fleet Nasrullah I’ll assure myself of another year in the black.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">After Fleet Nasrullah added the Gr. I Californian to his stakes pelt, along with a Hollywood Premiere victory under the conditioning of Nazworthy, who had been retained by Johnston, even Hertz tried to buy him back for $500,000 but, Johnston, who had bought him primarily as a potential sire for his Old English Rancho, had a “no” reply ready. Pin Oak Farm in Kentucky offered $650,000, but Johnston kept his word that he wouldn’t sell him for a million.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Finally, after using him for three years in California to large books at $6,500 a season, Johnston did sell him—for well over a million.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It was a big loss to the state’s breeding program but, fortunately, and oddly enough, he sired his best breeding sons, Gummo and Don B., before becoming a “hard boot.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Fleet Nasrullah’s dam, the unraced Happy Go Fleet, by Count Fleet, was foaled by Draeh, a winning, full sister to the “futurity specialists,” Occupy and Occupation.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">As a 2–year–old, Fleet Nasrullah was a brilliant, speed-crazy colt, exploding his tremendous speed all at once and leaving nothing for later.

<p id="sec442" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Oak Ridge Construction v. Tolley</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Superior Court of Pennsylvania, 1985.</p>
<p class="sectionb">351 Pa.Super. 32, 504 A.2d 1343.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ H<small>OFFMAN</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">In June, 1982, the Tolleys and Oak Ridge entered into a contract pursuant to which Oak Ridge agreed to construct a residence on the Tolleys’ property for $64,500. The Tolleys provided Oak Ridge with specifications, which were incorporated into the contract, and a plot plan. The specifications contained, inter alia, the following provision:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">20. Water Supply Drill well 150’ deep with 40’ of 6’ casing, ⅓ H.P. submersible pump and a 21 gallon storage tank. Should well be more than 150’ a charge of $6.50 per ft. will be made. Should casing be over 40’ a charge of $7.00 per ft. will be made. Should well depth require a deep lift pump, extra cost to be borne by owner. Well depth over 100’ may require a larger pump.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before drilling began, Oak Ridge warned the Tolleys that the well might be very deep because other wells in the area had been drilled to depths of 760 and 975 feet. Oak Ridge then drilled the well at a place indicated by one of the Tolleys’ employees after referring to the plot plan. It was completed on August 24, 1982, after being drilled to a depth of 800 feet. On August 27, Oak Ridge sent the Tolleys an invoice including charges of $4225 for the extra 650 feet of drilling and $616 for an extra 88 feet of casing, amounts computed using the rates specified in the contract. On September 2, Mr. Tolley wrote Oak Ridge stating that those charges were “in dispute or disagreement. All work under item 20 (Water Supply) * * * are [sic] to cease pending satisfactory resolution or settlement under item 13 (Arbitration) of our construction agreement.” Oak Ridge replied on September 7, stating that it believed that the Tolleys had breached the contract by refusing to pay the invoice and that it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page861" class="pagebreak">861</span>was giving them ten days notice under paragraph seven of the contract (Termination by Contractor), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Should owner in any manner, by act or omission, violate or breach any covenant herein, then CONTRACTOR may, at his option, terminate this agreement, upon ten (10) days written notice to OWNER of any such violation or breach. Upon failure of OWNER to correct the same within the ten (10) day period, then, and in such event of termination, CONTRACTOR shall be entitled to receive payment for all unpaid materials, labor, and work of sub-contractors, for work and materials completed, installed, delivered on site, and ordered but undelivered and not installed, plus 20% of the total contract price as liquidated damages. In the event CONTRACTOR shall stop work hereunder, he shall in no way be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever as a result thereof.</p>
<p class="indent">Oak Ridge also notified the Tolleys that it was stopping work on the house and named an arbitrator in response to Mr. Tolley’s letter and pursuant to paragraph thirteen of the contract.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_164" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-164" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> On September 10, Mr. Tolley responded, stating, “arbitration under our contract is not advised at this time.”</p>
<p class="indent">Based upon these facts, the court below found that the Tolleys had committed an anticipatory breach of the contract justifying Oak Ridge’s termination. We disagree.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">An anticipatory breach of a contract occurs whenever there has been a definite and unconditional repudiation of a contract by one party communicated to another. A statement by a party that he will not or cannot perform in accordance with agreement creates such a breach.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In order to constitute a repudiation, a party’s language must be sufficiently positive to be reasonably interpreted to mean that the party will not or cannot perform. Mere expression of doubt as to his willingness or ability to perform is not enough to constitute a repudiation, although such an expression may give an obligee reasonable grounds to believe that the obligor will commit a serious breach and may ultimately result in a repudiation * * *. However, language that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page862" class="pagebreak">862</span>under a fair reading “amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract” constitutes a repudiation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code § 2–610. Restatement, supra § 250 comment b.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, we cannot say that the language in Mr. Tolley’s letter constituted a “definite and unconditional repudiation” of the contract which “amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract.” The letter merely stated that the charges for work performed under item twenty of the contract’s specifications were “in dispute or disagreement” and requested resolution of the dispute under the arbitration clause of the contract. The letter did not contain an unequivocal refusal to pay the drilling charges or a repudiation of the entire contract. Thus, when Oak Ridge gave the Tolleys ten days’ notice that it was terminating the contract, the Tolleys had not committed an anticipatory breach.</p>
<p class="indent">We must therefore turn to the Tolleys’ contention that Oak Ridge breached the contract either by (1) drilling the well to the allegedly unreasonable depth of 800 feet or (2) stopping work on the house. In connection with their first allegation, the Tolleys argue that the lower court erred in striking testimony concerning the reasonableness of drilling a well to that depth. We disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">Questions of the admission and exclusion of evidence are within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. The court may exclude evidence that is irrelevant or merely cumulative of other evidence. At trial, the Tolleys sought to introduce testimony to show that it was unreasonable for Oak Ridge to drill an 800 foot well because (1) most wells in the area were not that deep and (2) water found in wells of that depth may be of poor quality. However, item twenty of the contract specifications required Oak Ridge to drill a well 150 feet deep, unless a deeper well was necessary to ensure an adequate water supply, and the well location was established by the plot plan provided by the Tolleys. Furthermore, Oak Ridge warned the Tolleys that other wells in the area had been drilled to depths as great as 975 feet and that a deep well might be necessary to achieve an adequate water supply. Under these circumstances, where the contract required Oak Ridge to dig a well at the site specified by the Tolleys and they had been warned that a deep well might result, we find that evidence concerning the depth of other wells in the area was irrelevant and the lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it. In addition, it is well settled law that a contract to dig a well presents a different question from that presented in contracts by manufacturers or builders * * *. While there is an implied understanding in the contracts of manufacturers and builders that the completed subject of the contract shall be reasonably suitable for its purpose, this implication is based upon the supposed superior knowledge of the manufacturer or builder. However, since the quantity, if any, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page863" class="pagebreak">863</span>the quality of water a well will furnish is unknown to both parties, there is no implication, if the contract is silent in these respects, that the well when completed will be a producing well; or, if it is productive, there is no implication as to the quantity or quality of water to be obtained therefrom.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the contract was silent as to the quality of the water to be produced. We therefore find that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in striking testimony concerning the quality of the water in this well and others of its depth when such quality was not properly at issue.</p>
<p class="indent">The Tolleys also allege that Oak Ridge breached the contract by stopping work on the house on September 7. “When performance of a duty under a contract was due, any nonperformance is a breach.” Restatement supra § 235(2). If a breach constitutes a material failure of performance, then the non-breaching party is discharged from all liability under the contract. In determining whether a failure of performance is material, we consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="blockquote">a) the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;</p>
<p class="blockquote">b) the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for that part of that benefit of which he will be deprived;</p>
<p class="blockquote">c) the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;</p>
<p class="blockquote">d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances;</p>
<p class="blockquote">e) the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Restatement, supra, § 241.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, having found that the Tolleys did not anticipatorily breach the contract, we must find that Oak Ridge breached it by stopping work on the house on September 7 without justification. We must therefore consider whether that breach was material in light of the factors enumerated above. The Tolleys, as the injured party, were deprived of the expected benefits of their contract (i.e., receiving a completed home) by Oak Ridge’s work stoppage, and could not be adequately compensated for that deprivation by an award of damages. Furthermore, Oak Ridge’s letter of September 7 gave no indication that the company would cure its failure to perform, and, in fact, the record indicates that Oak Ridge never did so act. Of course, a finding of material breach will result in forfeiture for Oak Ridge (i.e., the Tolleys will be discharged from all liability on the contract), however Oak Ridge will be entitled to restitution for any benefit conferred upon the Tolleys by part performance or reliance (i.e., the cost of digging the well) in excess of the loss Oak Ridge caused by its <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page864" class="pagebreak">864</span>own breach. We note that the record contains no evidence concerning whether Oak Ridge’s conduct “comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.” Under these circumstances, we find that Oak Ridge’s breach constituted a material failure of performance thereby discharging the Tolleys from all liability under the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the Tolleys contend that the lower court erred in awarding damages to Oak Ridge for the Tolleys’ anticipatory breach of the contract. In view of our holding that Oak Ridge, rather than the Tolleys, breached the contract, we agree and remand the case to the lower court for a determination of damages.</p>

<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 2–609. Right to Adequate Assurance of Performance.</span></h4>
<p class="list_alpha">(1) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other’s expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(3) Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party’s right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(4) After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.</p>
<p class="list_alphap">C<small>OMMENTS</small>:</p>
<p class="list_alphapi"><span class="italic">1.</span> The section rests on the recognition of the fact that the essential purpose of a contract between commercial men is actual performance and they do not bargain merely for a promise, or for a promise plus the right to win a law suit, and that a continuing sense of reliance and security that the promised performance will be forthcoming when due is an important feature of the bargain. If either the willingness or the ability of a party to perform declines materially between the time of contracting and the time for performance, the other party is threatened with the loss of a substantial part of what he has bargained for. A seller needs protection not merely against <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page865" class="pagebreak">865</span>having to deliver on credit to a shaky buyer, but also against having to procure and manufacture the goods, perhaps turning down other customers. Once he has been given reason to believe that the buyer’s performance has become uncertain, it is an undue hardship to force him to continue his own performance. Similarly, a buyer who believes that the seller’s deliveries have become uncertain cannot safely wait for the due date of performance when he has been buying to assure himself of materials for his current manufacturing or to replenish his stock of merchandise.</p>
<p class="list_alphapi"><span class="italic">4.</span> What constitutes “adequate” assurance of due performance is subject to the same test of factual conditions. For example, where the buyer can make use of a defective delivery, a mere promise by a seller of good repute that he is giving the matter his attention and that the defect will not be repeated, is normally sufficient. Under the same circumstances, however, a similar statement by a known corner-cutter might well be considered insufficient without the posting of a guaranty or, if so demanded by the buyer, a speedy replacement of the delivery involved. By the same token where a delivery has defects, even though easily curable, which interfere with easy use by the buyer, no verbal assurance can be deemed adequate which is not accompanied by replacement, repair, money-allowance or other commercially reasonable cure.</p>
<p class="list_alphapi">The adequacy of the assurance given is not measured as in the type of “satisfaction” situation affected with intangibles, such as in personal service cases, cases involving a third party’s judgment as final, or cases in which the whole contract is dependent on one party’s satisfaction, as in a sale on approval. Here, the seller must exercise good faith and observe commercial standards….</p>
<p class="list_alphapi">The entire foregoing discussion as to adequacy of assurance by way of explanation is subject to qualification when repeated occasions for the application of this section arise. This Act recognizes that repeated delinquencies must be viewed as cumulative. On the other hand, commercial sense also requires that if repeated claims for assurance are made under this section, the basis for these claims must be increasingly obvious.</p>
<p id="sec444" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Does the UCC entitle an injured party to adequate assurance of future performance after an immaterial breach? How about a material breach? Or is a material breach necessarily also a repudiation which does not require a demand for assurance of performance before taking legal action on it?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page866" class="pagebreak">866</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Is the real test of materiality of a breach of an installment whether or not it is of such a nature as reasonably to destroy confidence in the party who has breached? If it is, should not “retraction” of a material breach before the injured party changes his position always be permitted if such retraction is accompanied by adequate guarantees of performance?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Should retraction by the breaching party be necessary after a true immaterial breach? Is it? But after even an immaterial breach, shouldn’t the non-breaching party nonetheless be entitled to adequate assurance of performance within thirty days if he requests it as provided in § 2–609? Why should the breaching party object to such a procedure if his breach is truly immaterial?</p>

<p id="sec445" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Pittsburgh–Des Moines Steel Co. v. Brookhaven Manor Water Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1976.</p>
<p class="sectionb">532 F.2d 572.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ P<small>ELL</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">The record discloses the following series of events. On July 24, 1968, PDM, a designer, fabricator, and engineer of steel products, submitted a proposal to Brookhaven for the construction of a one-million-gallon water tank for $175,000. The original proposal incorporated, as terms of payment, 60 percent upon receipt of materials in PDM’s plant, 30 percent upon completion of erection, and 10 percent upon completion of testing, or within 30 days after the tank had been made ready for testing. The original terms were not satisfactory to Brookhaven’s president, Irving Betke, and were subsequently changed. The altered payment term provided that 100% of the contract price was due and payable within 30 days after the tank had been tested and accepted. The altered proposal was signed and accepted by Brookhaven on November 26, 1968.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometime during the following month Norman Knuttel, PDM’s district manager who had prepared and signed the original and revised proposals, talked to a representative of the Arbanas Construction Company which company had contracted with Brookhaven for the construction of the tank foundation. Knuttel was informed that Brookhaven had received a loan from Diversified Finance Corporation. Although this information as to the receipt of the loan was incorrect, Brookhaven had negotiated with Diversified for a loan for the purpose of the construction which negotiations continued into the following year. Under date of January 3, 1969, PDM’s credit manager wrote Diversified with a copy to Betke which letter in part was as follows:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page867" class="pagebreak">867</div>
<p class="bqs">[W]e hereby request a letter assuring that $175,000.00 for payment of the referenced project will be held in escrow and fully committed to payment to us upon completion of referenced elevated tank.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">As a matter of good business we are holding this order in abeyance until receipt of such notification.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract contained no provision for escrow financing. Brookhaven, through Betke, took no action upon the receipt of the copy of the letter. Subsequently, after further correspondence and meetings, resulting primarily from Brookhaven’s not having secured a planned loan of $275,000.00 from Diversified Finance, PDM’s credit manager sent an air mail, special delivery letter to Betke, dated March 19, 1969, which suggested that Betke “mail us your personal guarantee of payment of $175,000.00 as per the contract, to protect us in the interim between now and the time your loan is completed.”</p>
<p class="indent">While the contract specified the payment of the amount mentioned no later than 30 days after completion of the tank, it was silent as to any reference to a personal guarantee by Betke. The letter concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="bqsi">Upon receipt of such guarantee, we could immediately set in motion our shop fabrication which would result in earlier completion of your new tank.</p>
<p class="bqsi">When your loan is completed we will still require a letter of instructions to be forwarded from you to your bank, or other financial institution which extends this loan, that $175,000.00 is to be held in escrow for disbursement only to Pittsburgh–Des Moines Steel Company in accordance with our contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The construction of the water tower was scheduled to begin on April 15, 1969. A crew had been scheduled for the site three months previously, and a crew was ready to appear there on April 15, 1969. As matters transpired, however, the tank was never installed at Brookhaven’s site. On March 31, 1969, Betke sent PDM Comptroller Harry Kelly his personal financial statement, but he did not send PDM his personal guarantee for the loan. After Betke failed to provide his personal guarantee of the $175,000.00 contract price, PDM took no further steps toward performance.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_165" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-165" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> On April 22, 1969, Kelly, PDM Secretary–Treasurer Tom Morris, PDM Sales Manager Dwight Long, and Betke attended a meeting on the Brookhaven premises. Although the record reveals somewhat inconsistent versions of the details of that meeting, it appears that Morris told Betke that PDM would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page868" class="pagebreak">868</span>complete the fabrication of the tank and deliver it to the job site within a matter of weeks but that Betke replied that he had no need for the tank until the following year.</p>
<p class="indent">Further efforts to implement the contract broke down completely after April 22, 1969. Brookhaven’s installation of the reinforced concrete foundation for the tank had been accomplished at a cost to it of $18,895. Subsequent to the March meeting, Brookhaven purchased additional land and developed two wells which provided an adequate water supply. Brookhaven later sold all its assets, including both equipment and land, to the City of Darien. At the trial of the damages issue, an expert in demolition testified that the cost of removing the reinforced concrete foundation would be about $7,000. On the basis of this testimony, which was proffered upon the legal theory that Brookhaven had a right to recover the cost of the removal, the district court found that the total amount of damages sustained by Brookhaven was the sum of $25,895.00 and entered judgment in its favor for that amount.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">II. Claimed Bases of Liability</span></p>
<p class="indent">Under the contract as executed, into which prior negotiations had been merged, Brookhaven’s performance of its principal obligation to pay the purchase price was not due until after the completion of construction. Nevertheless within a period of time shortly more than one month after the contract became effective, PDM was requesting that a prospective lender of the funds to Brookhaven should hold the entire $175,000.00 in escrow. This was not a request that a lending institution give a letter of intent or otherwise confirm that it would make a particular loan when the payment became due after completion of construction. Instead the letter explicitly would, if honored, have required Brookhaven to complete all necessary loan papers and to arrange for the consummation of the loan, the proceeds of which would then be held by Diversified for some months until the work was completed. It is no answer to say that perhaps Brookhaven could have arranged for the escrowed fund to have been invested in some safe, readily liquidable form which might offset in part at least the loss to Brookhaven resulting from having to pay interest on money already borrowed. PDM having purported to agree not to ask for progress payments during the course of construction, more than half of which would have been due before the first act took place by PDM on the construction site, it now was substituting another requirement clearly beyond any requirement contemplated in the contract which would not have put the purchase price in hand but would nevertheless have it where it could be available for the picking at the appropriate time. The contract is silent as to any right of PDM to insist Brookhaven provide any such guarantee during the period before completion of construction. Further, PDM made it quite clear that it was “holding this order in abeyance until receipt of” notification that the money was being so held. We find no basis for an inference that at this time Brookhaven was not ready, willing and able to perform its obligations under the contract nor that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page869" class="pagebreak">869</span>it would not be able to pay when it owed. The fact that there had been negotiations for a loan of money that would not be needed for some months, which negotiations had not come to fruition, does not support such an inference. Two months after the letter to Diversified, PDM reaffirmed its lack of retreat from the position of requiring assurance that the money would be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="indent">PDM argues that its position was in accordance with Section 2–609 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) enacted into law in Illinois. That section which “creates a new contract enforcement procedure for the situation where one party feels insecure as to the other’s performance” reads in pertinent portion as follows:</p>
<p class="noindentt">[UCC § 2–609, quoted here, is reprinted at p. 864]</p>
<p class="indent">There appears to be considerable doubt that a seller was entitled to this protection prior to the adoption of the UCC; therefore before deciding that question we address ourselves to whether the UCC is applicable to the present transaction. That determination is primarily dependent upon whether the one-million gallon water tank constitutes “goods” within the meaning of the UCC which defines the term in § 2–105(1) as: “‘Goods’ means all things, including specially manufactured goods, which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and things in action.”</p>
<p class="noindent">…</p>
<p class="indent">The district court apparently regarded the matter as being the not entirely unfamiliar situation of a corporate credit department not viewing a contract of sale with the same <span class="italic">joie de vivre</span> as did the sales department; but the court thought that the sales department had legally committed the firm and that the credit department had gone beyond the grounds for actuating the assurance provided by the statute.</p>
<p class="indent">We find ample support in the cases arising under the UCC itself that the scope of coverage of “goods” is not to be given a narrow construction but instead should be viewed as being broad in scope so as to carry out the underlying purpose of the Code of achieving uniformity in commercial transactions. The Code, which by its own terms, § 1–102, is to be liberally construed, should be uniformly applied to achieve its purposes. We believe Illinois would so decide. In the present case, while the finished tank was scarcely one to be taken off the shelf, we are unaware of any authority that specially manufactured small dies should be goods and a very large tank not so classified. In the words of the UCC this was a “movable” “thing” “specially manufactured.” That which PDM agreed to sell and Brookhaven agreed to buy was not services but goods as defined in the UCC.</p>
<p class="indent">That determination, however, is not dispositive of the ultimate issue. The question remaining is whether PDM’s actions subsequent to the execution of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page870" class="pagebreak">870</span>contract were within the protection provided by § 2–609. We hold that they were not.</p>
<p class="indent">The performance to which PDM was entitled was the full payment of the purchase price within a specified time after the completion of the tank. While we have a substantial question as to whether PDM made a written demand as required by the statute, in keeping with our concept that the UCC should be liberally construed, we do not desire to rest our decision on a formalistic approach. Letters were written which conveyed what PDM wanted done before they would pursue their obligations under the contract. The fundamental problem is that these letters, if they be deemed to be in the nature of a demand, demanded more than that to which PDM was entitled and the demand was not founded upon what in our opinion was an actuating basis for the statute’s applicability.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not construe § 2–609 as being a vehicle without more for an implied term being inserted in a contract when a substantially equivalent term was expressly waived in the contract. The something more to trigger applicability of the statute is that the expectation of due performance on the part of the other party entertained at contracting time no longer exists because of “reasonable grounds for insecurity” arising. We find that PDM’s actions in demanding either the escrowing of the purchase price or a personal guarantee lacked the necessary predicate of reasonable grounds for insecurity having arisen. The contract negates the existence of any basis for insecurity at the time of the contract when PDM was willing to wait 30 days beyond completion for payment. The fact that Brookhaven had not completed its loan negotiations does not constitute reasonable grounds for insecurity when the money in question was not to be needed for some months. Reasonable business men prefer in the absence of some compulsive reason not to commence paying interest on borrowed money until the time for the use for that money is at hand. The credit manager’s January letter that the order was being held in abeyance until receipt of notification of escrowing was based upon a “matter of good business,” but not upon any change of condition bearing upon Brookhaven’s ability to discharge its payment obligation under the contract. With regard to the later request for a personal guarantee, it is not uncommon for an individual to decline assuming obligations of a corporation in which he is a shareholder. Indeed, the use of the corporate device frequently has as a principal purpose the limitation on individual exposure to liability. If an unfavorable risk in dealing with a corporation exists at contracting time, good business judgment may well indicate that an assurance be secured before contracting that there will be individual shareholder backup. None of this occurred and the record is silent as to any reasonable grounds for insecurity arising thereafter.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that one officer of PDM testified that the company did not send a crew because we questioned whether we might be paid for the project “at that time.” Some more objective factual basis than a subjective questioning, in our opinion, is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page871" class="pagebreak">871</span>needed to demonstrate reasonable grounds for insecurity. Likewise, another PDM officer testified that it was the company’s normal and regular procedure not to erect a structure “until we have reason to believe that the funds to pay for the structure are available.” The time of which he was speaking was a time at which there was no contractual requirement that the funds be available. The funds were only required to be available after completion of installation. He testified further that the normal procedure was not to erect until satisfactory arrangements were made. None of this subjectively normal procedure was imposed as a provision in the contract which in view of the withdrawn provision for progress payments showed reasonably to Brookhaven that not only payment, but arrangements for payment, would not be necessary until after completion.</p>
<p class="indent">We, of course, would not deprive PDM of resort to § 2–609 if there had been a demonstration that reasonable grounds for insecurity had arisen. The proof in that respect was lacking. The comptroller and supervisor of PDM’s credit department testified that he had access to all of the credit information that the company had regarding Brookhaven, that he had reviewed that information, and that he was unaware of any change in the financial condition of Brookhaven between November of 1968 and the end of 1969. Finally, we note that despite the professed subjective questioning in April as to whether PDM might be paid, the credit manager as early as January had said that the job would be held in abeyance until arrangements had been made for escrowing and a month after the questioning, the questioning officer had offered to proceed with construction in exchange for an interest in Brookhaven, an unlikely course if Brookhaven were financially in a questionable condition. There was also testimony with the same inference that PDM was not fearful of Brookhaven’s financial stability or ability to pay in connection with PDM lending to Brookhaven the amount involved at an interest rate of 9½% which rate was then unacceptable to Brookhaven. If the buyer was unable to pay for the performance of the contract, it is difficult to see that it was better able to pay a promissory note. We do not fault Brookhaven for its rejection of various proposals advanced by PDM each of which amounted to a rewriting of the contract in the absence of a proper § 2–609 basis. The fact, if it were a fact, that Brookhaven may not have had a large amount of cash lying in the bank in a checking account, not an unusual situation for a real estate developer, does not support the belief that it, as a company with substantial assets, would fail to meet its obligations as they fell due. Section 2–609 is a protective device when reasonable grounds for insecurity arise; it is not a pen for rewriting a contract in the absence of those reasonable grounds having arisen, particularly when the proposed rewriting involves the very factors which had been waived by the one now attempting to wield the pen. The situation is made no more persuasive for PDM when it is recalled that that company was the original scrivener.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page872" class="pagebreak">872</div>
<p class="indent">Brookhaven’s request to put off the contract for a year clearly came after PDM’s repudiation of the contract and was indicative of nothing more than that Brookhaven was willing to undertake a new arrangement with PDM a year hence. Pursuant to § 2–610 of the UCC, Brookhaven was entitled to suspend its own performance by virtue of the anticipatory repudiation by PDM and to resort to available remedies, including damages pursuant to § 2–711 of the Code.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>UMMINGS</small>, J., concurring.</p>
<p class="indent">Although I agree with the result reached in the majority opinion, I differ with the reasoning. Reasonable men could certainly conclude that PDM had legitimate grounds to question Brookhaven’s ability to pay for the water tank. When the contract was signed, the parties understood that Brookhaven would obtain a loan to help pay for the project. When the loan failed to materialize, a prudent businessman would have “reasonable grounds for insecurity.” I disagree that there must be a fundamental change in the financial position of the buyer before the seller can invoke the protection of UCC § 2–609. Rather, I believe that the Section was designed to cover instances where an underlying condition of the contract, even if not expressly incorporated into the written document, fails to occur. See Comment 3 to UCC § 2–609. Whether, in a specific case, the breach of the condition gives a party “reasonable grounds for insecurity” is a question of fact for the jury.</p>
<p class="indent">UCC § 2–609, however, does not give the alarmed party a right to redraft the contract. Whether the party invoking that provision is merely requesting an assurance that performance will be forthcoming or whether he is attempting to alter the contract is a mixed question of law and fact, depending in part upon the court’s interpretation of the obligations imposed on the parties. In this case, PDM would have been assured only if significant changes in the contract were made, either by receiving Betke’s personal guarantee, by attaining escrow financing or by purchasing an interest in Brookhaven. The district court could properly conclude as a matter of law that these requests by PDM demanded more than a commercially “adequate assurance of due performance.”</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. This case illustrates a classic conflict between the corporate sales and credit departments. The world looks very rosy to salespersons; it is optimism that makes sales. The world looks very risky to credit managers; you never can tell when the healthiest of debtors will suddenly go belly up or the most saintly appearing debtor will turn out to be a crook who has run off with the security. Judges in contract cases like to talk about the intent of the parties. When the parties are corporations that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page873" class="pagebreak">873</span>intent is especially problematic. Where does one look to discover the intention of a corporation, into the vast, sunny chambers of the salesman’s cheery heart or into the dark, fear-constricted cells of the credit manager’s mind?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Under its original proposal PDM would have received 90% of the purchase price by completion of the job, but under the modified deal they would receive nothing until 30 days after “testing and acceptance.” Can you think of a sensible reason why Brookhaven would require these terms? After all, water tank construction would not appear a very risky business, no one suggests that the Pittsburgh–Des Moines Steel Company is not fully solvent, and water tank technology has been around a long time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. This deal fell apart when it became clear that Brookhaven’s anticipated bank loan “had failed to materialize.” What would you advise PDM to do when that happened? Do you think it should have continued with the project? What were its alternatives?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Is any request for modification potentially a material breach? How should PDM handle this situation next time? Perhaps all sales invoices should bear in large type the legend, “ALL ORDERS ACCEPTED SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE CREDIT DEPARTMENT.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Compare the approach taken in this case to the question whether this contract was a sale of goods governed by the UCC with that taken in <span class="italic">Printing Center of Texas v. Supermind Publishing</span>, p. 824.</p>

<p class="indent">It is, indeed, one of the consequences of the doctrine of anticipatory breach that, if damages are assessed before the time of performance has expired, the court must take the chance of forecasting the future as best it can. That does not mean that it will ignore what has happened, when the period of performance has already expired. Damages never do more than restore the injured party to the position he would have been in, had the promisor performed; this is not a rule peculiar to anticipatory breach, though that is an instance. Hence it is always an answer, in that or other similar situations, to show that, had the contract continued, the promisee would not have been entitled to the performance, though he was apparently so entitled when the promisor disabled himself or repudiated.</p>

<p class="sectionb">New Jersey Superior Court, Law Div., 1962.</p>
<p class="sectionb">74 N.J.Super. 12, 180 A.2d 393.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ R<small>IZZI</small>, J.D.C. (temporarily assigned). This is an action for breach of contract by the defendant in which plaintiff seeks damages for loss of profits under a written contract entered into between the parties under date of August 15, 1958. Plaintiff is in the business of leasing various types of merchandise machines, and on the above date the parties entered into a written agreement whereby machines were to be placed by plaintiff into defendant’s bowling alley premises for a period of five years. This contract gave plaintiff the exclusive privilege of placing its machines for the purpose of selling the merchandise described therein at defendant’s location during the existence of the contract. The case was tried by the court without a jury and, after the trial was completed, the court pronounced its findings of fact and conclusions of law which included, <span class="italic">inter alia,</span> that defendant had breached the contract on or about July 28, 1959 by having closed down plaintiff’s machines and having commenced the sale of various items of merchandise through other methods on the premises in question. There was also the finding of fact that defendant’s bowling alley premises had been completely destroyed by fire on March 24, 1961 and had never been reconstructed thereafter. Plaintiff claimed damages for loss of profits that he would have enjoyed during the five-year period commencing on August 15, 1958 and continuing until August 15, 1963.</p>
<p class="indent">The issues remaining to be decided were whether the contract became impossible of performance by the fire of March 24, 1961, and if so, whether such impossibility, in the face of the prior breach of the said contract, would disentitle plaintiff to damages for the full five-year period or until August 15, 1963, or whether such damages would be limited to the time before the fire.</p>
<p class="indent">It is defendant’s contention that the destruction of the premises on which the contract was to be performed thereby made the contract impossible of performance as of that date, and that plaintiff is only entitled to collect damages for loss of profits from the date of the contract to the date of the fire. Plaintiff contends that at the time of the fire defendant had already breached the contract, and therefore defendant’s liability would continue during the full life of the contract, namely, until August 15, 1963, notwithstanding the destruction of the premises aforesaid. It has been conceded by the parties that if plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for the full five-year period, he will obtain a judgment for the sum of $7,924.21; but if plaintiff is limited in damages to the date of the fire aforesaid, he will be entitled to a judgment in the amount of $2,507.27.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page875" class="pagebreak">875</div>
<p class="indent">I … find no difficulty in concluding as a matter of law that the destruction of the bowling alley premises on March 24, 1961 made the contract impossible of performance on that date.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff urges, however, that the contract was already in breach on the day of the fire and that its damages should be measured during the entire five-year life of the contract. The court has already concluded that such breach occurred on or about July 28, 1959, when defendant had ceased the use of plaintiff’s machines and had commenced the use of other facilities for the sale of merchandise described in the contract. The diligent research of counsel has failed to produce any precedent by the courts of the State of New Jersey that deal directly with the factual situation herein described….</p>
<p class="indent">A reasonable analogy to the problem of supervening impossibility is found in the law of contracts concerning illegality as a defense, and particularly in situations where a contract was legal when made and an anticipatory repudiation of the contract followed by the promisor and thereafter the performance of the acts contracted for had become illegal. This type of a situation is treated in 6 Williston, Contracts (rev. ed. 1938), § 1759, p. 4996, wherein the author states the following to be the law:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Where there has been an anticipatory repudiation of the contract and subsequently, but before the date when the promised performance becomes due, that performance is made illegal, a practical defect in the doctrine of anticipatory breach is illustrated. The difficulty is not peculiar to cases of supervening illegality but is involved in every other case where, after an anticipatory breach, supervening impossibility occurs which would in any event prevent and excuse performance of the contract. The situation differs, also, in only a slight particular, hereafter referred to, from one where it appears after the anticipatory breach that though there were no legal excuse the return performance could not or would not have been rendered to the repudiator. In each of these cases, if all the facts could have been known or foreseen at the time of the repudiation, no cause of action on the contract would have arisen. It is a practical disadvantage of the doctrine of anticipatory breach that an action may be brought and perhaps judgment obtained before the facts occur which prove that there should have been no recovery. Fortunately in most cases this evidence, though not available at the time of the repudiation, becomes available before judgment can be obtained.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It seems clear that if the evidence thus becomes available the plaintiff can recover no substantial damages, and in the case of supervening illegality which is not due to the defendant’s fault, there seems no reason to allow even nominal damages. The loss should rest where chance has placed it; and the same should be true in case of any supervening excusable impossibility.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page876" class="pagebreak">876</div>
<p class="indent">Restatement, Contracts, § 457, p. 849 (1932), discusses the effect of supervening impossibility in the following language:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Except as stated in § 455, where, after the formation of a contract facts that a promisor had no reason to anticipate, and for the occurrence of which he is not in contributing fault, render performance of the promise impossible, the duty of the promisor is discharged, unless a contrary intention has been manifested, even though he has already committed a breach by anticipatory repudiation; but where such facts occur after the time when performance of a promise is due, they do not discharge a duty to make compensation for a breach of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Following the above statement of law, various comments appear. Comment (d) appears to be particularly appropriate to the issue here involved and is stated as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Impossibility on the part of a promisor occurring after he has committed a breach does not ordinarily discharge him, but it will do so if the breach consists merely of an anticipatory repudiation. After a breach of any other kind impossibility supervening before the time for full performance has elapsed will limit the damages recoverable if the impossibility would have occurred had there been no breach. Thus if an employer or employee who breaks his contract becomes so ill shortly afterwards that the contract could not have been performed, recovery will be limited.</p>
<p class="indent">The weight of authority leads the court to the view that upon breach of contract by a promisor, supervening impossibility occurring through destruction of the subject matter without the fault of the promisor will limit the damages recoverable to the time before the impossibility has taken place.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment will be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,507.27 and costs.</p>
<p id="sec449" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTION AND NOTE</span></p>
<p class="indent">This decision is a clear statement of a generally accepted rule in cases of anticipatory repudiation, that is when the obligation is repudiated before performance is due. When the only breach is a repudiation, a court in assessing damages will take into account supervening events between breach and trial. Implicit in that doctrine is the idea that if the contract is terminated by a present material breach by nonperformance, rather than a repudiation, the disappointed party’s rights are fixed as of the date of the breach, and its claim to the full expectancy is not diminished by later events. The only remaining question in this case is whether Stanisci closing down Model Vending’s machines was merely an anticipatory repudiation or a present material breach by nonperformance. While you are worrying about that, consider again <span class="italic">Taylor v. Johnston,</span> p. 850. Was the breach there present or anticipatory?</p>

Such a promise is not present here. The only provision of section 5 conceivably relevant is that “Windy Heights has good and marketable title to the Property and all other properties and assets * * * as of December 31, 1980.” But this is quite different from the conditions of section 3 that a title insurance policy and mortgage confirmation be produced at the closing, which took place in April, 1982. Both the complaint and plaintiff’s affidavits are premised on nonperformance of section 3 of the agreement, not section 5.</p>

<p class="fn_txt1">My first suggestion is, that we should firmly resolve never to speak of the intention of a testator or other writer on a given point except after we have carefully convinced ourselves that that point was actually in his mind when he wrote the words in question. For example, we will never say “He intended this result” when we merely think that if he had foreseen the present contingency (which he didn’t) then he would have intended this result. That consideration may be helpful, but it is not his intention.</p>

And assume Kea was introduced in 1939. If from 1939 on, Nyafat still held its own, Kea was not injuring Nyafat. On the other hand, if Nyafat again declined while Kea went up, Kea would be invading Nyafat’s own irreducible minimum market. To be sure, this is an oversimplified example, and many extraneous factors affecting marketing would have to be eliminated. This would be the task of expert witnesses.</p>

Those contracts did not require that plaintiff’s rights to the breeding services of Fleet Nasrullah should be relegated to a secondary or subordinate position to that of any other person, whether he be a holder of shares in the stallion or not. No such conditions were stated in the contracts and none can be inferred therefrom. From the conduct of the defendants, their agent Dr. Pessin, and their subagent Mrs. Judy, plaintiff was justified in concluding that the defendants were just giving him the run around and had no intention of performing their contract in the manner required by its terms and as required by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Their conduct and that of their agent Dr. Pessin, and their subagent Mrs. Judy up to and including June 13, 1966 constituted a breach of defendants’ breeding contracts with plaintiff and plaintiff was then justified in treating it as a breach and repudiation of their contractual obligation to him.”</p>

Moreover, defendants concede without argument that the trial court impliedly found the time of performance to be the breeding season.</p>

<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-162" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_162" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a>.  Q. * * * At any time, did Mrs. Judy or anyone else ever tell you that she could not or would not breed either mare to Fleet Nasrullah before the end of 1966? * * *</p>

<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-163" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/19_chapter08.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_163" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a>.  Plaintiff suggests that this conduct, namely delaying plaintiff’s breeding until a day not reserved by a shareholder, amounted to an anticipatory breach because Mrs. Judy inserted a condition to defendants’ performance, which as the trial court found was not contemplated by the contracts. Assuming arguendo that this conduct might have amounted to a breach of contract by improperly delaying performance, at most it would have constituted only a partial breach—insufficiently material to terminate the contracts. It did not constitute a repudiation of the contracts which was the sole basis of the trial court’s decision since “[t]o justify the adverse party in treating the renunciation as a breach, the refusal to perform must be of the whole contract or of a covenant going to the whole consideration * * *.” (<span class="italic">Atkinson v. District Bond Co</span>., 5 Cal.App.2d 738, 743.)</p>

All appointments hereunder shall be made within ten (10) days after notice from either party that a dispute exists. If for any reason said appointments are not made within the time allowed, then either party shall have the right to their remedies at law. The cost of said arbitration (herein defined as the record costs and the fees of arbitrators) shall be equally borne between OWNER and CONTRACTOR, each to pay his own expenses and attorney’s fees.</p>

However, it is also noted that as late as March 19, 1969, PDM had written Betke that upon the receipt of the guarantee, the shop could immediately set in motion fabrication. It is not clear whether PDM did anything to dispel the clear inference to Betke that there would be no fabrication, or at least further fabrication, until the guarantee had been received.</p>
