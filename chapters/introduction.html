<p class="indent">This Casebook introduces contract law to first-year American law students. The materials and the teaching method reflect the special structure of the legal system and legal education in the United States. The study of contract law has been central to the first-year law curriculum since Christopher Columbus Langdell developed “the case method” in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The case method has dominated American legal education for more than four generations. Contracts was the first case method course, and remains the only required first year course in every accredited law school.</p>
<p class="indent">Contract law has both a past and a future. A subject with such a long history might be rather cut and dried, with few mysteries left to be fathomed. In fact, a rather rigid set of doctrines and rules did develop in contract law during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This formalism supported the values, educational approach, and political structures of that period. By the second quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, however, scholars and judges expressed increasing doubt whether that universal and abstract logical style reflects the commercial realities contract law must deal with and whether that style of reasoning helps or hinders the resolution of specific cases.</p>
<p class="indent">Gradually, the hard crust of traditional rules was broken by new approaches. While the classical rules continue to exert an influence (and students therefore must learn them), contract law today displays continuing vigor and growth. This new contract law is more specific and contextual. For example, labor and employment law, the law of partnerships, corporations, and other business organizations, and enterprise liability for products are all based on contracts, as are the professional relationships between lawyers and their clients and health care providers and their patients. It may be more accurate to say today that there are a number of bodies of law for different kinds of contracts, although these distinct bodies of law do share some general approaches.</p>
<p class="noindent_hd"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">The Central Themes of Contract Law</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Contract law describes how and when society uses the authority of law to enforce private agreements. This core subject matter sets Contracts apart from other first-year courses. Property, for example, considers how society uses law to recognize people’s interests in possessing things to the exclusion of other persons. Torts examines those non-contractual occasions when a person is legally obligated to compensate another for violating that other person’s legally recognized interests. Criminal law considers the use of punishment to enforce rules of social behavior. The courses in procedure focus on the processes used by courts to protect all of these interests.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2" class="pagebreak">2</div>
<p class="indent">Inevitably, these compartments of the law are to some extent artificial and overlap. For example, when the law recognizes an agreement as enforceable, it creates a kind of property. The law will enforce the owner’s claims to exclusive possession of those rights and usually will allow the contract-owner to sell them to a third person. Those who interfere with a contractual relationship may be liable in tort or punished criminally for their behavior. The procedural system frequently serves as a limiting factor on the enforcement the law gives to a private agreement. Unless there is a practical way to assert a claim and an effective remedy for the redress of valid claims, the abstract rights declared by the law do not mean much. The hard fact is that the law is indeed a “seamless web”: a subject-matter with neither a simple, easily identifiable pattern, nor a single appropriate point to begin its study.</p>
<p class="indent">This Casebook attempts to impose some order on the field of contract law by identifying the following broad themes into which specific issues can be sorted in the study of the subject.</p>
<p class="blockquote">(1) <span class="italic">Contract as a Concept and as an Institution</span>. What promises are legally enforceable and why?</p>
<p class="blockquote">(2) <span class="italic">Formation.</span> How are binding agreements made? At what point in time do contract principles restrain the parties’ freedom of action?</p>
<p class="blockquote">(3) <span class="italic">Performance and Breach.</span> On what basis does a lawyer determine the extent to which a contractual obligation has been performed or breached? To what degree does this determination assign factual and legal meanings to the terms the parties have explicitly or tacitly undertaken through their relationship? And to what extent does the law for societal reasons decide whether there has been performance or breach by imposing terms on the parties’ relationship, regardless of their intentions?</p>
<p class="blockquote">(4) <span class="italic">Remedies.</span> What legal relief is available to a party dissatisfied with how an agreement is working out? In what situations and to what extent are these remedies essential, helpful, irrelevant, or useless?</p>
<p class="blockquote">(5) <span class="italic">Contract as Property.</span> Can a party transfer an interest in a contract to someone else as a house or a car might be sold? How far can parties to a contract go in creating rights and liabilities in third persons? When are outsiders prevented from interfering with contractual relationships?</p>
<p class="blockquote">(6) <span class="italic">Contract and Social Control.</span> To what extent is a contract more than a private matter, of significance not only to the parties who made it? When must a contract’s legal recognition and performance be regulated to protect community interests?</p>
<p class="noindent">These six themes form the core of the study of contract law.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page3" class="pagebreak">3</div>
<p class="noindent_hd"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">This Casebook in Outline</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">This Casebook consists of nine chapters in addition to this Introduction and the Appendix, which reprints relevant sections from Articles 1 and 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter One looks generally at the concept of promises, how they are given meaning in law, and the circumstances that will lead a lawyer to say that a promise is unenforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter Two introduces the crucial question of remedies. If contracts are legally enforceable promises, we must examine with care what “legally enforceable” means.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter Three builds on the remedial framework discussed in Chapter Two. It examines four distinct ways that the law counterbalances the shortcomings of the basic contract remedies described earlier. When confronted by doctrine that deals unsatisfactorily with an important problem, one common response is to create a distinct set of rules under a different label and let judges decide which rules apply when. Thus, we find an alternative set of restitutionary remedies that mitigates hardships arising out of the denial of relief under the basic contract remedial scheme. Or, in aggravated cases, courts may lift the matter bodily out of the conceptual framework of contract and give it the more hospitable label of tort. This adjustment in nomenclature makes new and more generous damage rules available. Third, courts in many situations permit parties to pre-plan appropriate remedies through liquidated damages clauses. Finally, parties may contract their way out of the law courts altogether by arbitration agreements that empower a new set of tribunals applying a distinct set of rules.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter Four looks at the limits placed on contract by legal rules that may not be varied by agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter Five introduces related limits on contract that flow from failures of the agreement process itself. One strong justification for enforcement of agreements is the obligated party’s assent to the agreement. When the reality of that assent becomes dubious, legal enforcement of the ensuing contract may weaken.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter Six examines one kind of promise our law has found particularly important and worthy of enforcement, the bargained-for exchange. The concept of the bargain forms the foundation of the doctrine of consideration, which is theoretically central to much American contract law. This chapter will also look at some of the other theories of contract enforceability that supplement and compete with consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter Seven looks at the process of contract making. It asks when and how people become bound by their promises.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page4" class="pagebreak">4</div>
<p class="indent">Chapter Eight assumes a contract has been validly formed and examines how the law responds to events after formation. How do people satisfy the obligation to perform their contracts and what kinds of deviations will be considered a breach?</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter Nine asks a different sort of question. It looks at the contract from the perspective of persons other than those who made the original agreement. To what extent does the existence of a contract affect others’ rights?</p>
<p class="noindent_hd"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Is There a Law of Contracts?</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">This Casebook assumes that it is useful to act as though there is a body of learning that can be described as the law of contracts. This assumption is not obvious: The law of sales is very different from the law of employment agreements, and both are very different from the law of insurance contracts. But the similarities are as important as the differences and suggest an underlying set of shared doctrinal ideas.</p>
<p class="indent">The unity of contract law is also limited by its history and growth as a judge-made body of rules. Most contract law doctrines in common law countries originated in the reasons given by judges in deciding specific cases. Only gradually and imperfectly have those reasons accumulated and become reconciled into coherent doctrine. The study of contract law in an English-speaking law school is grounded on the examination of judicial decisions. In most of the rest of the world a civil law tradition relies heavily on the exposition of a logical structure of rules derived from a few axiomatic propositions and embodied in a code.</p>
<p class="indent">Deriving general principles out of specific cases decisions is difficult at best. Until a case arises, there may be no rule on a particular point. When the facts shift just a bit, it is difficult to apply that rule to the altered circumstances. It can be difficult to tell from a judicial opinion what is the general principle and what are the exceptions and limitations that generalities are always subject to. The law of contract presents the challenge of learning a body of rules that is weak on systematics, full of gaps, and likely to offer more than one principle that might be applied to the case.</p>
<p class="indent">The unity of contract law is challenged in yet another way. The common law of contracts began in the royal courts of England. Although there were several such courts and the competition among them sometimes led to divergent statements of the law, general consistency was assured by the recognized hierarchy of authority. For more than 200 years in the United States, contract has been primarily a matter of state, rather than federal, law. While most states recognized the same authorities and basic rules of law, there were notable variations and conflicts. As the United States developed a single national economy a century ago, the pressures to reconcile the diverse strands of state contract law became very strong. Today there are few major points of conflict in the law of contracts of most American states. The economic situation is changing rapidly again, however, as increasingly interdependent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page5" class="pagebreak">5</span>world markets increase the likelihood that a transaction will cross national borders, raising international law and choice of law questions.</p>
<p class="indent">The emergence of a global economy has an important effect on agreement behavior. People do business together but do not share the same linguistic and cultural tradition or legal regime. The meaning of words, the implications of actions, and the content of applicable legal rules become more difficult to determine. Because the laws of the contracting parties’ nations may be different, parties in negotiating a contract must establish a shared legal framework for the transaction. The growth of international transactions has led to important international commercial law in the form of treaties and conventions. This book will provide excerpts from two such sources, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts to provide a glimpse of this emerging body of global law.</p>
<p class="noindent_hd"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Contracts Litigation in the United States</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">We study contract law primarily by examining how doctrine has developed over time in the decisions of appellate courts. The jurisprudential approach of Legal Realism teaches that the law-in-fact is not found so much in high-flown statements of abstract doctrine and rules, but pragmatically is discovered in terms of what a court will do in a concrete case. As Justice Holmes taught, the law is what a court will make a bad person do in a specific situation. The case method is itself, however, subject to a number of pragmatic limits. Few cases are appealed to the higher courts, and most contracts disputes are resolved without anyone going to any court. How can one resolve these cases based on assumptions about what some appellate court (that will never hear the matter) would decide?</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, many more serious contracts disputes have been resolved by arbitration and alternative dispute resolution than by the courts, but precise numbers are hard to find. Moreover, of those contracts cases that remain within the state and federal court systems, a tiny and ever decreasing percentage appear to be resolved by trials or appeals. <span class="italic">See</span> Marc Galanter, <span class="italic">The Vanishing Trial: An Examination of Trials and Related Matters in Federal and State Courts</span>, 1 J. Empirical Legal Stud. 459 (2004). One may glean some idea of the baseline of contract litigation by looking at statistics developed by the <span class="italic">Civil Justice Survey of State Courts, 2005</span> published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (Dec. 2008).</p>
<p class="indent">This study examined a sample of cases from the courts of general jurisdiction in the 75 largest counties in the United States and extrapolated a national picture from that sample. The 2005 data suggest that about one million contract suits were filed in state courts, representing more than half the civil lawsuits filed in the nation. “Lawsuit” is defined to exclude a very large number of judicial proceedings that are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page6" class="pagebreak">6</span>not truly contested litigation, such as the probate of decedent estates and other domestic relations matters. Of course, it also excludes the very large number of criminal and juvenile proceedings and the supervision of persons of impaired mental capacity. It also excludes a relatively small number of contract disputes that are filed in federal courts (about 30,000 in recent years). The federal cases include cases in which the United States is a party and some very large commercial disputes but are only a very small fraction of the total.</p>
<p class="indent">More than half the plaintiffs bringing suit were individuals; businesses brought 43% of the cases; and the rest were initiated by government agencies and hospitals. Almost 60% of the defendants were businesses. Individuals usually were the plaintiffs and businesses the defendants in claims of fraud, breach of lease agreements, and employment complaints. These types of cases made up about 30% of the total number of contract suits. Another 30% of the contract cases tried in state courts in 2005 were complaints made by a seller of goods that the buyer had failed to pay the price for the goods delivered. In most cases there was at least one third party plaintiff or defendant named in addition to the primary parties.</p>
<p class="indent">How were the contracts disputes that reached the courts disposed of? Twothirds were settled or dismissed by agreement, transferred, or referred to arbitration. In another 26% of the cases, a default judgment was granted when the defendant failed to appear in court. Only 2.2% were disposed of by trial on the merits. Only one case in a thousand was resolved by jury verdict. The trend since 1992 has been towards far fewer contracts cases and fewer jury trials. In 2005, only 3,474 contracts trials occurred in the 75 largest counties in the United States (down from 9,744 in 1992), and juries adjudicated only 1,250 of these cases. Many contracts cases are resolved in a few months by default, settlement, dismissal or summary judgment. The small number of cases resolved by trial are likely to take over two years to resolve. Even among the relatively few contracts cases tried, profound conceptual issues are rarely involved. Remember as you read the many appellate decisions in this Casebook that it is a very rare contract dispute that winds its way up to a court of appeals or state Supreme Court. Few contract disputes result in lawsuits, few lawsuits go to judgment in the trial court, few of these are appealed, and only a small fraction of these wind up as reported appellate cases.</p>
<p class="noindent_hd"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">The Tools Used by Law Students</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">This Casebook will introduce you to types of primary legal texts that will be tools for much of your professional activity and a tradition of interpretation, a different set of ways to give meaning to those text. The primary legal materials include cases (that is, judicial decisions in contract disputes) and statutes (that is, rules of law enacted by a legislature). Judicial opinions and statutes are quite different from the kinds of texts used earlier in your education.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page7" class="pagebreak">7</div>
<p class="indent">(1) <span class="italic">The Case.</span> In most American jurisdictions, contract law is common law, which means that it is judge-made case law. There is, for example, in most states no single statute to which one can turn for an authoritative statement of the total law of contract formation. Where statutes do exist, they take on meaning largely as a result of being interpreted by courts on a case-by-case basis. While the primacy of judgemade contract law is far less true today than it once was, it is still largely so.</p>
<p class="indent">Contract law, therefore, did not emerge as the product of one keen analytic mind or of one lawgiver who synthesized a coherent and consistent set of principles. Rather, contract law accumulated slowly over the centuries as judges decided specific tough cases and gave reasons for their decisions. Such principles as emerged grew out of the facts of particular disputes at given times and places, and were not deduced from a set of logical axioms. Law developed through such a process is never complete and never final.</p>
<p class="indent">Time corrodes most things: Some of the cases and statutes in this book are centuries old, and yet retain that wonderful quality of continuing to make sense. Other decisions and rules, while sensible when made, may seem out of tune with the contemporary world and current values. The security provided by a good decision is not eternal; sooner or later the question will be brought up again and must be seriously reconsidered.</p>
<p class="indent">This book is built primarily out of appellate court decisions, yet there are limits on the usefulness of appellate cases as a teaching tool. In the Anglo–American system of justice, appellate court consideration of cases is supposed to be based on the facts found in the trial court by the judge or jury. Unlike Continental European practice, American law permits little appellate review of the evidence. The appellate court is generally required to assume that the facts are those found by the lower court. Because their studies emphasize appellate cases, first-year students can lose sight of the basic indeterminacy and open-ended nature of most factual inquiries. These characteristics of fact-finding can be lost in well-intentioned pedagogical efforts to build final principles on assumed and certain hypothetical facts. Yet as Judge Jerome Frank teaches on p. 61, “Perhaps nine-tenths of legal uncertainty is caused by uncertainty as to what courts will find, on conflicting evidence, to be the facts of cases.” From the moment of first contact with a client, a lawyer’s greatest difficulty is likely to be determining what in fact happened, or at least what are the important parts of what happened.</p>
<p class="indent">To derive law from decisions in past cases, the lawyer must analyze the facts of the case with precision. If facts remain indeterminate, it is difficult to tell whether a case that comes along is like an earlier one, and therefore whether it should be governed by the same rule of law. On the other hand, too rigid a sense of the relevant reduces the flexibility offered by a system where like cases are decided alike. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page8" class="pagebreak">8</span>capacity to see new fact patterns in familiar circumstances is needed if legal institutions are to deal with emerging realities through common law problem solving. Often the tension is between two truths, two plausible ways of describing the same disorderly reality.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the cases in this book were decided many centuries ago; others are very recent. The older cases are often included to introduce you to basic principles that form a baseline so accepted that there are no recent cases in which the parties thought them worth arguing about. Sometimes the Casebook includes older authorities that struggle with past problems that have influenced the shape of current doctrine even though the specific problem itself is no longer a current one because of a changed legal or business environment. Some of these cases were decided by wise and famous judges, others by men unknown to us except for their opinions. Some were decided in large commercial centers, others by judges in rural communities. Most are decisions of American courts, but a few are from English courts.</p>
<p class="indent">That these decisions are collected here as a means of teaching contract law indicates two central values of the common law: reason and precedent.</p>
<p class="indent">The practice of writing judicial opinions reflects one aspect of justice: justice is reasoned decision, reaching the right conclusion in a case so that the rightness of the result is articulated in terms that can be understood by other people. Many of the cases in this book may seem easy now, but they were tough for the judges who faced the problem for the first time. Many of these cases could have been decided more than one way. Beginning law students sometimes cynically view every judicial opinion as an after-the-fact rationalization for a decision made on an unstated arbitrary basis. But most judges are not so disingenuous. Judicial opinions, like all human activities, are subject to foibles and fallibilities, whims, and prejudices. Judges are the products of their time, their class, and their community. Their views reflect the biases and sensibilities of those backgrounds. Some mornings they get up on the wrong side of the bed and don’t seem to be able to do anything right. But on other days they find it possible to “live greatly in the law.” Their faith in the force of reason is at the core of the common law view.</p>
<p class="indent">The value that the common law places on precedent means that judicial opinions are relied upon as authority in deciding new cases. This reflects another aspect of justice: justice is treating like things alike. If two people are in the same position, they should be treated equally. Rules of social conduct should apply to all members of the community so that all will know the consequences of particular conduct and can plan their behavior accordingly. A judicial opinion provides a guide for deciding similar situations similarly. “What is fair to do in this case is clear. We shall treat these parties the way we treated those other parties with the same problem before.” Since no two cases are ever exactly alike, the problem, of course, is determining similarity.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page9" class="pagebreak">9</div>
<p class="indent">This legal principle of following precedent is called <span class="italic">stare decisis,</span> the force of decision. It gives predictability to court-resolution of cases and ties the decision of one case to the decision of others. A lawyer advising a client can examine the relevant cases and predict what is likely to happen if the dispute ends up in court. Reliance on precedent often is a conservative force in the law, obstructing change in the name of following past practice. It may also be a very creative force in the law, drawing on experience to solve new problems.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of judicial opinions as a form of legal authority has implications for the relationship among courts. The courts in every state are organized in a familiar pyramid, and the legal correctness of decisions of lower courts may be reviewed by courts higher up the pyramid until they reach a court at the pinnacle that announces the rules for the whole system. Not only does a court follow its own past decisions, it is expected to follow the law announced by higher courts within its system.</p>
<p class="indent">It is easy to overstate the binding force of case authority, for in most jurisdictions later judges are bound to follow only what higher courts <span class="bold"><span class="italic">decide</span></span>, not what those courts <span class="bold"><span class="italic">say</span></span>. Courts decide cases, they do not announce rules. When a later court finds an earlier decision inapplicable, it will distinguish the earlier case by indicating how this case differs and why the result, therefore, should be different.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of deciding cases is essentially one of persuasion. Lawyers try to persuade judges that this case is like that case and quite distinguishable from the other case. The centrality of persuasiveness means that in practice, a court faced with a novel case will look to see how other courts dealt with the issue even if those courts are in another jurisdiction or lower in the pyramid. Thus, within a court system, precedent may bind a later court to follow an earlier decision that it may disagree with, but the influence of precedent is more often based on the earlier decision’s persuasiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) <span class="italic">The Statute.</span> A century ago few statutes dealt with contract law. But the common law process proved too slow, episodic, and uncertain to keep up with rapid social and commercial changes. Unaided, it could not meet the needs of a complex modern economy set in a global market. Early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century this country, following the example set a short time earlier in England, began to enact sweeping statutes governing the sale of goods, the carriage of goods by sea, commercial paper, and negotiable instruments.</p>
<p class="indent">This movement was facilitated in America by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), which through the drafting of model statutes sought to bring consistency in the law throughout the United States in place of the vagaries of separate, sometimes archaic, state laws. NCCUSL updated and brought together a number of previously adopted model uniform laws dealing with commercial problems in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), first promulgated by NCCUSL in the 1950s and subsequently enacted into law by all 50 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page10" class="pagebreak">10</span>state legislatures. We shall repeatedly refer to the UCC in this book, especially Article 2 which deals with the sale of goods. The 2000 Official Text of Article 2 of the UCC (promulgated earlier in substantially the same form as the 1978 Official Text and adopted with only relatively minor local variations) presently constitutes the law governing sales of goods throughout the United States notwithstanding NCCUSL’s subsequent promulgation of a controversial 2003 Official Text that was never enacted and subsequently withdrawn. In a few places we refer to the now-withdrawn 2003 Proposed Text and its proposed solutions to persistent problems that have arisen under the Official Text that remains in force.</p>
<p class="indent">Sections of Article 2 are set forth at places in the book for study with the topic a particular section deals with. To indicate the overall structure of this code, most of the key sections of the Official Text of Article 2 are reprinted in Appendix I. Although Article 2 by its terms applies only to contracts for the sale of goods, it has sometimes been influential in cases involving other kinds of contracts governed by general common law principles.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1986, the United States ratified the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The CISG provides the authoritative rules of law for that growing number of sales agreements that are international in character. Many provisions of the CISG resemble those of the UCC. In other cases, the representatives of the many nations that participated in creating the CISG drew upon rules taken primarily from other legal systems in the world, or in a few cases have introduced novel approaches to familiar problems.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) <span class="italic">Restatements.</span> As NCCUSL was framing model statutes to remedy some of the incompleteness, inconsistency, and uncertainty of case law, another distinguished body, the American Law Institute (ALI), took a different approach to the same problem. The ALI undertook to restate common law principles in a structured and logical way, weeding out ill-conceived and incoherent “rules” and local variations and collecting in one place a complete and reasoned view of the law. The product of these efforts has been a series of Restatements of the Law in such subjects as contracts, torts, trusts, property, agency, and restitution.</p>
<p class="indent">The Restatement of Contracts has been tremendously influential in the eighty years since it first appeared, but remember that the Restatement is not a statute. It is not “the law”; it has authority only to the extent that it is persuasive. Moreover, the Restatement has a major shortcoming in that its tidy presentation of general and symmetrical rules offers seductive security that does not square with the common law’s emphasis on the specific facts in a particular controversy. The Restatement is a useful tool, but one that must be approached with some caution. The ALI completed its Second Restatement of Contracts (the current one) in 1979 and relevant sections are excerpted in Appendix II after the UCC.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page11" class="pagebreak">11</div>
<p class="indent">The original Restatement of Contracts was very much a product of the dominant attitudes of its time. It reflected the thinking of the two magnificent scholars who were its major drafters, Professors Samuel Williston and Arthur Corbin. These scholars were great organizers and treatise writers. We live now in less self-confident times, in which doctrinal answers rarely find universal acceptance. Nevertheless the Second Restatement, to which we will refer throughout this book, remains helpful in explaining the structure of doctrine. The Second Restatement draws heavily on the UCC and related statutory changes.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) <span class="italic">Treatises.</span> Many of the great legal systems of the world rely upon treatises by authoritative scholars as the basic exposition of the law. The common law has been mightily influenced by learned authors from Bracton and Glanville to Coke, Blackstone, and Kent. During the formative period of our country’s history, its judges learned the law from those giants, and their thoughts continue to be important to those who wish to learn how the law got where it is. Today’s judges similarly grew up on Williston and Corbin. You may find Corbin’s or Williston’s multivolume treatises on contract law of help in exploring a point exhaustively. Beware of flooding yourself with masses of detail that may prove hard to put together or absorb.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) <span class="italic">The Hypothetical Case.</span> The beginning and the end of the matter is reasoned persuasion. Real disputes are the primary source of argument and decision, but lawyers have always depended heavily on the hypothetical fact situation as a basis for analogy and logical inference. Certainly one of the best ways to learn how to be a lawyer is to moot cases with classmates. Change the facts of a case in the book slightly and then argue why the change should or should not affect the decision. Only by arguing it out can one learn what kinds of distinctions <span class="italic">do</span> make a difference to lawyers and what kinds <span class="italic">should</span> make a difference. The questions after most of the cases in this book are designed to provide help in framing such hypotheticals.</p>
<p class="indent">Many beginning students assume that contract law can be reduced to a clear and consistent set of rules that can be applied to resolve all problems that arise. Some of the materials in this book do emphasize the rules and will help the student to learn to use conventional rules to resolve the kinds of situations in which they can be useful. Before very long, however, you are likely to make the vexing discovery that there are limits to the capacity of simple rules to resolve the problems. The circumstances may be special and not seem to fit the rule. The rule may be too general to give much guidance, but when one tries to frame a more specific rule, it quickly becomes too complex and exceptional situations keep arising in which the rule does not work well. Other interests demand to be considered that are not reflected in the rule. What is sometimes most troubling is that there are several competing rules, each with a claim to be applied, each leading toward a different result. The job may appear to be to separate the “right” rule from the “wrong” rule, but both rules seem right in a sense. It all depends on how one sees the situation and which aspect of it is most <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page12" class="pagebreak">12</span>important, which value seems most central. Resolving such issues is a much more tangled task than stating the rule and applying it. In the end, an answer may be reached, but all doubts still are not resolved. There is still something to be said for the other side of the question. The difficulty is that there are too many conflicting answers and no simple way to ultimately decide among them. The only way to resolve the matter is by cutting off the messy ends that do not fit the solution, by repressing recognition of the validity of the other viewpoint.</p>
<p class="indent">This can be a frustrating experience for a law student, but it is the common fate of lawyers and judges. Operating in the face of persistent doubt and uncertainty can be threatening and lead some students to become skeptical whether there are any correct answers. Sometime during the first year many students become sufficiently distressed to suspect that finding the law is just a game, that the judges and professors merely follow their own whims and respond to their prejudices, self-interests, and backgrounds. Central to the lawyer’s faith is recognition that these techniques and tools also may have the capacity to lead to the best available resolutions of some kinds of human problems. The matters may be persistently problematic, the answers arrived at may remain subject to cogent challenge, the route to resolution may be uncertain and tortuous, but in the end, there is only the limited comfort that, despite its limits, the answer is the best available to us here and now.</p>
<p class="indent">To help you prepare for class, this Casebook provides Questions and Notes every few pages. Pause after reading a case and see whether you can answer the questions. Sometimes one cannot give an answer because something is missing. Other questions simply may have no answer. A primary goal of this course is to teach aspiring lawyers to give meaning to a legal text by connecting factual circumstances with rules stating a legal value.</p>
<p class="indent">Try to write a simple paragraph answer to a question after a case and then have a friend read and comment on your answer. Pick a reader who will be critical of your writing style and clarity as well as your thinking, although the two are obviously connected. You need not pick another law student; someone not studying law may be a better test of your powers of clear explanation.</p>
<p class="indent">A short cogent answer to a question may be more challenging to produce than a complex and technical brief or contract. Yet writing a coherent paragraph analyzing a legal question is an essential lawyer’s skill. Because people believe that you possess that skill, someday they will place their trust in you and pay you a fee for your services. As you write such a paragraph you are likely to find that what seemed the obvious answer no longer makes sense. Cheer up, that’s often the first step toward a better answer.</p>
