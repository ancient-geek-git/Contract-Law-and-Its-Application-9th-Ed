<p class="indent">Bargaining may be prolonged or fleeting, but if successful, the parties reach agreement at some time. This moment of contract formation may be difficult to identify precisely, but it is of great significance. For that is when the full legal consequences of an enforceable agreement arise. From that moment, neither party may back out of the deal without liability.</p>
<p class="indent">Potential liability for one or both parties may exist before contract formation is completed. In the classic analysis of contract formation, that point of potential liability is first reached when one party makes a specific proposition to the other in such form that the person who makes the proposition is legally vulnerable to being bound to that proposition. She has, in legal terms, made an <span class="bold"><span class="italic">operative offer</span></span>. So long as the offer is outstanding, the party to whom it is made can bind himself and the offeror to the terms of the deal simply by manifesting assent to the terms proposed in the offer. Thereafter, neither party can withdraw or modify the deal without the consent of the other. The definition of the operative point in time may seem arid and metaphysical but it merely describes in lawyer’s terms the common sense difference between just talk and meaning business.</p>
<p class="indent">Determining this too-late-now-to-change-your-mind point can be a very important, for a perfect defense to a contract claim is either that no operative offer was ever made or that the offer was no longer operative at the time the plaintiff claims it was accepted. A person must be able to predict with some confidence whether she is vulnerable to becoming bound by another’s acceptance and whether she has the power to bind another by accepting his proposition. To sum up, in a dispute over contract formation, one begins with: (1) Was an operative offer ever made, and by whom? (2) Was that offer still operative when the claimed acceptance was given? and (3) Was there an operative acceptance?</p>
<p class="indent">Formation, or, as it is familiarly called, “offer and acceptance,” has long been a darling of legal education and often is the first topic students study in a Contracts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page634" class="pagebreak">634</span>course. The subject is dominated by rules and doctrines that appear crisp and clear but which prove troubling when they are tested by concrete cases or when probed during a class hour filled with imaginative professorial hypothetical situations that are analyzed in detail.</p>
<p class="indent">The question of when an offer may be revoked leads us to the land of the wildly improbable tale. Riders gallop across the moor toward York in response to a promise of payment if they complete the ride only to be disappointed almost in sight of their goal when the offer is revoked. (<span class="italic">Great Northern Railway Co. v. Witham</span>, p. 644.) This disappointing fate is shared by athletic young men who climb almost to the gold ball at the top of the flagpole only to be similarly deprived of their promised reward. Letters are fished out of mailboxes with a wad of chewing gum attached to a long string, creating endless doctrinal puzzles. Breakfast clubbers, lingering over their morning coffee, read about rewards in newspaper advertisements, look up, see a familiar face, and run off to catch the bank robber right outside their breakfast nook window.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a method to this madness. You should learn how to analyze a fact situation and apply a tightly crafted rule to it. The rules of formation set out in the Restatement, Second, Contracts, the UCC and the Convention on International Sale of Goods provide perfect fodder for this exercise, and you should learn them in your first year of law study. But also know that application of these rules remains uncertain at the edges. Mastering these rules, means understanding the limits of their usefulness.</p>
<p class="indent">The clear and simple rules of offer and acceptance attempt to deal with an equivocal reality by imposing upon it a set of conventional rules that claim to obviate the conflict and messiness of reality by providing a positive answer to all questions. The attempt fails because the rules are reductionist. They oversimplify the problems and strip them of the crucial detail of experienced reality. For example, the rules insist that there is a precise moment when “just talk” becomes “a deal.” Before that moment the parties have no obligations to each other. After that moment they are both fully bound to one another. Sometimes that is a fairly accurate picture of reality, but sometimes not. It works best in familiar transactions that are isolated deals between strangers, people who meet to “window-shop” and expect to walk away and never see each other again if it doesn’t reach the clear moment of decision to buy or sell. But many of the most important deals arise out of a stream of communications between parties and often grow out of a relationship that extends over a lifetime or even generations. The Maglicas (p. 340) met, fell in love, moved in together, made love, built a business, raised kids, shared twenty years, fought, and fell apart. Try squeezing that reality into the framework of offer and acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">In commercial deals, parties surf the web, read each other’s promotional materials, telephone and inquire about terms, make proposals, change their terms, think <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page635" class="pagebreak">635</span>it all over, and come back with a new deal. A sales representative may visit, take measurements, and dicker over price. The buyer may reach “an agreement in principle,” then remember an item he forgot to mention, learn from a brother-in-law that someone he knew had a bad experience in a similar deal and that you have to insist that the other side provide for adjustments, decide he wants a blue one instead of a green one, send out a purchase order, find out that one term will have to be changed and renegotiate it. The seller may then mail out a sales invoice that has some terms different from the purchase order, discover that the warehouse won’t deliver on Tuesday but will come through with the goods on Friday, deliver the goods, discover that one part is too big and the other is missing, and on and on. Picking one moment and saying that before then there was no deal and after that all the legal consequences of a contract apply is a Procrustean approach that makes the reality fit the rule only by cutting off all the pieces of the situation that do not conform to the simple model.</p>
<p class="indent">Imposing some form of conventional rules on contract formation may be inevitable. Reality is messy and doesn’t lend itself to simple analysis. Yet there are heavy costs associated with not being sure whether there is a binding contract or not. It may be better to have a clear but imperfect rule than endless disputes and legal fees. Moreover, reasonable people will often disagree on the significance of the tangle of reality. Buyers generally believe that they are free to walk away until the last moment, while sellers usually think that fair dealing requires a commitment to negotiation leading to a deal. When a seller invests lots of time and effort in meeting a buyer’s needs, he may assume the buyer is obligated to proceed in good faith to complete a deal unless there is some reason to back out. The wise guy who window shops and kicks tires all day with no intention to deal is regarded as little better than a thief. Feelings about such matters are quite situation-specific. Walking around a store and looking at price tags doesn’t imply commitment, but as the seller’s reliance increases, it becomes increasingly easy to find some expectation that the buyer will carry through in good faith.</p>
<p class="indent">You already have seen the fruits of the law’s insistence on a moment of formation in the problems that result from the tendency of that insistence to create compensating doctrinal pressures. For example, <span class="italic">Mattei v. Hopper</span>, p. 31, and <span class="italic">Sylvan Crest Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States</span>, p. 36, both involved buyers who used heavily conditioned promises in an effort to stall off the moment when they would be irrevocably bound to the promise to buy. Modification cases such as <span class="italic">Schwartzreich v. Bauman–Basch</span>, p. 525, can be understood as parties continuing the negotiation process to deal with changes that arise after offer and acceptance. The subcontractor bid cases such as <span class="italic">Drennan v. Star Paving</span>, p. 659, arise because the parties have conflicting interests in defining the moment when it becomes too late to back out or to insist on different terms. These considerations also play a role in the cases you read <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page636" class="pagebreak">636</span>on interpretation of incomplete agreements, such as <span class="italic">Lee v. Jos. E. Seagram &amp; Sons</span>, p. 602.</p>
<p class="indent">At the root of all this is the sense that sometimes a party is bound before a contract is fully formed, bound by unbargained-for reliance, or bound by obligations of good faith and fair dealing, or bound by some other theory, but certainly bound. The theory of liability may be hard to frame, but the sense of obligation is clear. These problems are not new, nor are they unique to our legal system. You are likely to have to wrestle with them throughout your career. From the beginning, you should be aware that they are a price paid for the advantages believed to follow from the crisp approach to formation described earlier in this Note.</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">Whether an offer is ripe for acceptance, or “operative,” might appear to be a simple question. But all of the problems of vagueness, illusoriness, lack of capacity, fraud, and those other elements that may fatally taint a promise are present here. Moreover, if bargain is the key to contract, an offeror must ask and receive delivery of an identifiable price in order for what he promises in return to be converted into a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Usually the price requested is in the form of a return promise from the person to whom the offer is addressed, but it may be a requested act, or it may be both. We shall return to the complications these possibilities can create. For now the task is to identify the earmarks of an operative offer.</p>

<p id="sec300" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Minnesota Supreme Court, 1957.</p>
<p class="sectionb">251 Minn. 188, 86 N.W.2d 689.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>URPHY</small>, J. This is an appeal from an order of the Municipal Court of Minneapolis denying the motion of the defendant for amended findings of fact, or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The order for judgment awarded the plaintiff the sum of $138.50 as damages for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">This case grows out of the alleged refusal of the defendant to sell to the plaintiff a certain fur piece which it had offered for sale in a newspaper advertisement. It <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page637" class="pagebreak">637</span>appears from the record that on April 6, 1956, the defendant published the following advertisement in a Minneapolis newspaper:</p>
<p class="centers">Saturday 9 A.M. Sharp<br />3 Brand New<br />Fur Coats<br />Worth to……$100.00<br />First Come<br />First Served<br />$1<br />Each</p>
<p class="indent">On April 13, the defendant again published an advertisement in the same newspaper as follows:</p>
<p class="centers">Saturday 9 A.M.<br />2 Brand New Pastel<br />Mink 3–Skin Scarfs<br />Selling for $89.50<br />Out they go<br />Saturday. Each……$1.00<br />1 Black Lapin Stole<br />Beautiful<br />worth $139.50……$1.00<br />First Come<br />First Served</p>
<p class="indent">The record supports the findings of the court that on each of the Saturdays following the publication of the above-described ads the plaintiff was the first to present himself at the appropriate counter in the defendant’s store and on each occasion demanded the coat and the stole so advertised and indicated his readiness to pay the sale price of $1. On both occasions, the defendant refused to sell the merchandise to the plaintiff, stating on the first occasion that by a “house rule” the offer was intended for women only and sales would not be made to men, and on the second visit that plaintiff knew defendant’s house rules.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court properly disallowed plaintiff’s claim for the value of the fur coats since the value of these articles was speculative and uncertain. The only evidence of value was the advertisement itself to the effect that the coats were “Worth to $100.00,” how much less being speculative especially in view of the price for which they were offered for sale. With reference to the offer of the defendant on April 13, 1956, to sell the “1 Black Lapin Stole * * * worth $139.50 * * *” the trial court held that the value of this article was established and granted judgment in favor of the plaintiff for that amount less the $1 quoted purchase price.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page638" class="pagebreak">638</div>
<p class="indent">1. The defendant contends that a newspaper advertisement offering items of merchandise for sale at a named price is a “unilateral offer” which may be withdrawn without notice. He relies upon authorities which hold that, where an advertiser publishes in a newspaper that he has a certain quantity or quality of goods which he wants to dispose of at certain prices and on certain terms, such advertisements are not offers which become contracts as soon as any person to whose notice they may come signifies his acceptance by notifying the other that he will take a certain quantity of them. Such advertisements have been construed as an invitation for an offer of sale on the terms stated, which offer, when received, may be accepted or rejected and which therefore does not become a contract of sale until accepted by the seller; and until a contract has been so made, the seller may modify or revoke such prices or terms.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant relies principally on <span class="italic">Craft v. Elder &amp; Johnston Co.</span> In that case, the court discussed the legal effect of an advertisement offering for sale, as a one-day special, an electric sewing machine at a named price. The view was expressed that the advertisement was “not an offer made to any specific person but was made to the public generally. Thereby it would be properly designated as a unilateral offer and not being supported by any consideration could be withdrawn at will and without notice.” It is true that such an offer may be withdrawn before acceptance. Since all offers are by their nature unilateral because they are necessarily made by one party or on one side in the negotiation of a contract, the distinction made in that decision between a unilateral offer and a unilateral contract is not clear. On the facts before us we are concerned with whether the advertisement constituted an offer, and, if so, whether the plaintiff’s conduct constituted an acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous authorities which hold that a particular advertisement in a newspaper or circular letter relating to a sale of articles may be construed by the court as constituting an offer, acceptance of which would complete a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The test of whether a binding obligation may originate in advertisements addressed to the general public is “whether the facts show that some performance was promised in positive terms in return for something requested.” 1 Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) § 27.</p>
<p class="indent">The authorities above cited emphasize that, where the offer is clear, definite, and explicit, and leaves nothing open for negotiation, it constitutes an offer, acceptance of which will complete the contract. The most recent case on the subject is <span class="italic">Johnson v. Capital City Ford Co.</span>, in which the court pointed out that a newspaper advertisement relating to the purchase and sale of automobiles may constitute an offer, acceptance of which will consummate a contract and create an obligation in the offeror to perform according to the terms of the published offer.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether in any individual instance a newspaper advertisement is an offer rather than an invitation to make an offer depends on the legal intention of the parties and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page639" class="pagebreak">639</span>the surrounding circumstances. We are of the view on the facts before us that the offer by the defendant of the sale of the Lapin fur was clear, definite, and explicit, and left nothing open for negotiation. The plaintiff having successfully managed to be the first one to appear at the seller’s place of business to be served, as requested by the advertisement, and having offered the stated purchase price of the article, he was entitled to performance on the part of the defendant. We think the trial court was correct in holding that there was in the conduct of the parties a sufficient mutuality of obligation to constitute a contract of sale.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The defendant contends that the offer was modified by a “house rule” to the effect that only women were qualified to receive the bargains advertised. The advertisement contained no such restriction. This objection may be disposed of briefly by stating that, while an advertiser has the right at any time before acceptance to modify his offer, he does not have the right, after acceptance, to impose new or arbitrary conditions not contained in the published offer.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec301" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What tests would you apply to the advertisement in this case to determine its practical effect on you, the typical buyer? What would your expectations be if you trotted down to the Great Minneapolis Surplus Store and you were first in line? Fourth in line? Fortieth in line?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Would your expectations be different if the words about limited quantity were not in the ads? Suppose they merely read: “Fur Coats—Worth to $100—First Come, First Served—$1 each.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Suppose there were a sign on the door of the Great Minneapolis Surplus Store when you arrived that read as follows: “Sale offer in yesterday’s paper has been withdrawn.” How would you react? Would the addition of words explaining that the price in the ad was a typesetter’s mistake alter your reaction?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Would the furs on sale have to be in new condition? Suppose all of them had stains and blemishes. Does the offer have to describe the condition of the furs to be potentially binding?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. How (and when) would you expect your deal on the sale item to be closed? Would saying, “I’ll take this one” bind the surplus store? Suppose you asked for credit on the surplus store’s usual terms of 10% down and the rest in ten easy installments of 9¢ apiece? Suppose you asked to have the coat delivered?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Is the result in <span class="italic">Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store</span> consistent with the following Comment <span class="italic">b</span> to Restatement, Second, Contracts § 26?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page640" class="pagebreak">640</div>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="italic">b. Advertising.</span> Business enterprises commonly secure general publicity for the goods or services they supply or purchase. Advertisements of goods by display, sign, handbill, newspaper, radio or television are not ordinarily intended or understood as offers to sell. The same is true of catalogues, price lists and circulars, even though the terms of suggested bargains may be stated in some detail. It is of course possible to make an offer by an advertisement directed to the general public, but there must ordinarily be some language of commitment or some invitation to take action without further communication.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">7</span>. Shouldn’t sellers be held to sell goods at the terms they advertise? False advertising is extensively regulated by both federal and state government and is often a misdemeanor under state criminal law. It is also likely to be misrepresentation and a tort. Why the reluctance to treat it as a breach of contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">8</span>. Although the traditional “black-letter” rule is that an advertisement is not ordinarily an offer, Jay Feinman and Stephen Brill argue that, upon close examination, the cases, while acknowledging the traditional rule in <span class="italic">dicta</span>, actually hold that advertisements are offers in the specific cases before them. Moreover, they argue that this is the correct result as a general matter: “An advertisement is an offer because it is right for the public to expect, the legislature to dictate, and the courts to enforce standards of fairness in the marketplace.” Jay M. Feinman &amp; Stephen R. Brill, <span class="italic">Is an Advertisement an Offer? Why It Is, and Why It Matters</span>, 58 H<small>ASTINGS</small> L.J. 61 (2006).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">9</span>. By the way, why is Mr. Lefkowitz buying ladies’ clothing? Is it for his wife? Or is it for himself? Is the Great Minneapolis Surplus Store’s “house rule” targeted at men generally, or men who want to purchase women’s clothing? What if the advertised items were men’s clothing, or gender neutral?</p>

<p id="sec305" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What hallmarks turn a bargaining proposal that into an operative offer? The specificity and completeness of the negotiations leading to it are two obvious signs of its ripeness; a detailed and lengthy proposal is more likely to be considered an operative offer. But what about the converse: does the vagueness or incompleteness of a manifestation of intent prevent it from being an offer?</p>
<p class="noindent">R<small>ESTATEMENT</small>, S<small>ECOND</small>, C<small>ONTRACTS</small> § 24 provides:</p>
<p class="blockquote">An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.</p>
<p class="noindent">R<small>ESTATEMENT</small>, S<small>ECOND</small>, C<small>ONTRACTS</small> § 33 provides:</p>
<p class="list">(1) Even though a manifestation of intention is intended to be understood as an offer, it cannot be accepted so as to form a contract unless the terms of the contract are reasonably certain.</p>
<p class="list">(2) The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="list">(3) The fact that one or more terms of a proposed bargain are left open or uncertain may show that a manifestation of intention is not intended to be understood as an offer or as an acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you state a rule more contentful than these two sections? Is the approach taken by the Restatement consistent with UCC § 2–204? Does the total omission of some very important terms prevent the conclusion that the proposal is an offer?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The validity of open-price contracts under the CISG is not as obvious as a reading of Article 55 alone suggests. CISG Article 14(1) provides:</p>
<p class="list">(1) A proposal for concluding a contract addressed to one or more specific persons constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. A proposal is sufficiently definite if it indicates the goods and expressly or implicitly fixes or makes provision for determining the quantity and the price.</p>
<p class="noindent">When would Article 55 apply given Article 14(1)? Some of the experts drafting the Convention have taken the view that Article 55 applies only “where a contract has been validly concluded,” but that an agreement based on an open price term is not based on a valid offer because of Article 14(1). Authoritative reconciliation of these divergent strands in the CISG will require further interpretive litigation.</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">An offeror is vulnerable to being bound to a contract by the acceptance of his offer. “Duration of the offer” refers to the time within which an offeree may bind the offeror. The offeree’s power to bind arises with the making of an operative offer and continues until it is terminated. While the offeree’s power may be terminated in a number of ways (some of which will be discussed later in this Chapter), two of the more important are lapse of time and revocation or withdrawal of the offer before acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">The preceding four sentences highlight how confusing lawyer’s vocabulary can be when it adopts the habit of describing people by attaching the endings “or” and “ee” to indicate their legal status. One who makes an offer is an offeror, and one who receives the offer is the offeree. Later you will learn about assignors and assignees, mortgagors and mortgagees, subrogors and subrogees, and on and on. The habit is too deeply engrained to be eradicated, but it is unfortunate. For one thing, many lawyers far into their careers remain confused as to who is the mortgagor and who is the mortgagee. Offeror and offeree and promisor and promisee have another vice that should lead you to avoid using this terminology if you can. Most contracts involve reciprocal negotiations leading to the exchange of promises. In such a case it is misleading and ambiguous to refer to one side as promisor (or offeror) and the other promisee (or offeree) because there are multiple promises (or multiple offers and counteroffers) made and received by each side. You can more clearly identify the parties by name or by reference to their role in the transaction (for example, buyer and seller or builder and owner).</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the party making the offer may put a time limit on it, and that limit will be respected by the courts. But even if no specific time limit is set, offers eventually die of old age. The life span of an offer varies with the surrounding facts and circumstances, and the expert who ultimately determines its duration is a court.</p>
<h4 id="sec307" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">A.   R<small>EVOCATION</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">If a promise not supported by consideration is unenforceable, it logically follows that an offer can be withdrawn by an offeror at any time prior to the receipt of consideration by its acceptance. This is the traditional common law rule, subject as usual to several interesting variations, some logical and some not. Leaving the consideration doctrine to the side, there is nothing inevitable about the rule permitting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page644" class="pagebreak">644</span>free withdrawal of unaccepted offers. The rule could just as well be that every operative offer must be left open for a reasonable time to give the promisee a chance to consider and accept or reject it. This, too, would make sense, for in making a serious offer, the offeror must contemplate that the equally serious offeree will have a reasonable time to consider it or at least will have the amount of time stated in the operative offer itself. There are no insurmountable difficulties with this approach, and many advanced systems of law have adopted it. But the consideration concept has been too powerful in common law thinking to permit general acceptance of this alternative. So the basic approach with which we shall work is that an offeror is free to withdraw the offer at any time prior to acceptance.</p>

<p class="sectionb">Court of Common Pleas, 1873.</p>
<p class="sectionb">L.R. 9 C.P. 16.</p>
<p class="indent">The cause was tried before B<small>RETT</small>, J., at the sittings at Westminster after the last term. The facts were as follows: In October, 1871, the plaintiffs advertised for tenders for the supply of goods (amongst other things iron) to be delivered at their station at Doncaster, according to a certain specification. The defendant sent in a tender, as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">I, the undersigned, hereby undertake to supply the Great Northern Railway Company, for twelve months from November 1st, 1871, to October 31st, 1872, with such quantities of each or any of the several articles named in the attached specification as the company’s storekeeper may order from time to time, at the price set opposite each article respectively, and agree to abide by the conditions stated on the other side. [Signed] Samuel Witham.</p>
<p class="noindent">The company’s officer wrote in reply, as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mr. S. Witham:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">Sir: I am instructed to inform you that my directors have accepted your tender, dated, etc., to supply this company at Doncaster station any quantity they may order during the period ending October 31st, 1872, of the description of iron mentioned on the enclosed list, at the prices specified therein. The terms of the contract must be strictly adhered to. Requesting an acknowledgment of the receipt of this letter.</p>
<p class="blockquote">[Signed] S. Fitch, Assistant Secretary.</p>
<p class="noindent">To this the defendant replied:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">I beg to own receipt of your favor of 20th instant, accepting my tender for bars, for which I am obliged. Your specifications shall receive my best attention.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">S. Witham.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page645" class="pagebreak">645</div>
<p class="indent">Several orders for iron were given by the company, which were from time to time duly executed by the defendant; but ultimately the defendant refused to supply any more, whereupon this action was brought.</p>
<p class="noindent">A verdict having been found for the plaintiffs,</p>
<p class="noindent">Digby Seymour, Q.C., moved to enter a nonsuit.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ K<small>EATING</small>, J. In this case Mr. Digby Seymour moved to enter a nonsuit. The circumstances were these: The Great Northern Railway Company advertised for tenders for the supply of stores. The defendant made a tender in these words: “I hereby undertake to supply the Great Northern Railway Company, for twelve months, from etc. to etc., with such quantities of each or any of the several articles named in the attached specifications as the company’s storekeeper may order from time to time, at the price set opposite each article respectively,” etc. Some orders were given by the company, which were duly executed. But the order now in question was not executed; the defendant seeking to excuse himself from the performance of his agreement, because it was unilateral, the company not being bound to give the order. The ground upon which it was put by Mr. Seymour was, that there was no consideration for the defendant’s promise to supply the goods; in other words, that, inasmuch as there was no obligation on the company to give an order, there was no consideration moving from the company, and therefore no obligation on the defendant to supply the goods. The case mainly relied on in support of that contention was <span class="italic">Burton v. Great Northern Railway Co.</span> But that is not an authority in the defendant’s favor. It was the converse case. The Court there held that no action would lie against the company for not giving an order. If before the order was given the defendant had given notice to the company that he would not perform the agreement, it might be that he would have been justified in so doing. But here the company had given the order, and had consequently done something which amounted to a consideration for the defendant’s promise. I see no ground for doubting that the verdict for the plaintiffs ought to stand.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ B<small>RETT</small>, J. The company advertised for tenders for the supply of stores, such as they might think fit to order, for one year. The defendant made a tender offering to supply them for that period at certain fixed prices; and the company accepted his tender. If there were no other objection, the contract between the parties would be found in the tender and the letter accepting it. This action is brought for the defendant’s refusal to deliver goods ordered by the company; and the objection to the plaintiffs’ right to recover is, that the contract is unilateral. I do not, however, understand what objection that is to a contract. Many contracts are obnoxious to the same complaint. If I say to another, “If you will go to York, I will give you £100,” that is in a certain sense a unilateral contract. He has not promised to go to York. But if he goes, it cannot be doubted that he will be entitled to receive the £100. His <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page646" class="pagebreak">646</span>going to York at my request is a sufficient consideration for my promise. So, if one says to another, “If you will give me an order for iron, or other goods, I will supply it at a given price”; if the order is given, there is a complete contract which the seller is bound to perform. There is in such a case ample consideration for the promise. So, here, the company having given the defendant an order at his request, his acceptance of the order would bind them. If any authority could have been found to sustain Mr. Seymour’s contention, I should have considered that a rule ought to be granted. But none has been cited. <span class="italic">Burton v. Great Northern Railway Co.</span> is not at all to the purpose. This is matter of every day’s practice; and I think it would be wrong to countenance the notion that a man who tenders for the supply of goods in this way is not bound to deliver them when an order is given. I agree that this judgment does not decide the question whether the defendant might have absolved himself from the further performance of the contract by giving notice.</p>
<p class="indent">Rule refused.</p>
<p id="sec309" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What did the railroad accept by its letter of acceptance? What did the purchasing agent for the railroad think he was doing when he wrote that letter?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. After the railroad gave Witham an order, was Witham bound to fill only that order or all orders the railroad might place during the one-year term of the blanket order agreement? In other words, weren’t the parties bargaining here for a one-year assured supply rather than just a single order? Once the railroad placed an order, didn’t it accept the deal proposed and bind both itself and Witham to their agreement for a one-year term?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Can you find a promise by implication in the railroad’s letter to buy from no one else? If such a promise to buy from no one else were “made,” would this bind Witham to deliver all year as ordered by the railroad?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Anglo–American law might have taken any one of the approaches suggested in the three preceding questions. For better or for worse, however, the dominant position is that suggested in the case itself: a continuing offer is open for its term and may be accepted by placing an order before revocation. The acceptance binds the offeror to the extent of the order but no further, i.e., the offeror can revoke to the extent the offer is not yet accepted.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page647" class="pagebreak">647</div>
<h4 id="sec310" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">B.   O<small>PTIONS</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">One common device that renders an offer irrevocable is to cast it as an option. An option is a promise not to revoke another promise for a period of time. The irrevocability of an offer is neatly accommodated to the consideration requirement by making the sale of the power to revoke part of a two-level bargain transaction. Level one is the basic offer, for which a price is demanded but not yet received. Level two is a collateral offer to keep the basic offer open for a specified time, but for which <span class="bold"><span class="italic">another</span></span> price is demanded. Receipt of the price for irrevocability creates the option. It does not bind the other party to accept the basic offer. However, it does give that person time to consider whether or not to accept without fear that the offer will be withdrawn while it is being considered.</p>
<p id="sec311" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Marsh v. Lott</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Court of Appeals, 1908.</p>
<p class="sectionb">8 Cal.App. 384, 97 P. 163.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>HAW</small>, J. Action for specific performance of a contract, whereby plaintiff asserts that in consideration of 25 cents he was given an option to purchase, for the sum of $100,000, certain real estate owned by defendant. Judgment was rendered for defendant. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment, and from an order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract, specific performance of which is sought, is as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">For and in consideration of the sum of twenty-five cents to me in hand paid I hereby give Robt. Marsh &amp; Co. an option to purchase, at any time up to and including June 1st, 1905, with privilege of 30 days extension, from date hereof, the following described property, to wit: South ½ of lot 9 &amp; all of lot 8, block 101, Bellevue Terrace tract, and all of the property owned by myself in above block, for the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable thirty thousand cash, balance on or before 4 years, 4½% net.</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">I agree to furnish an unlimited certificate of title showing said property to be free from all incumbrance, and to convey the same in such condition by deed of grant, bargain and sale, &amp; pay regular commission.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">M.A. Lott. [Seal.] Date: Feby. 25th, 1905.</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Property: 90-165. Building: 6 flats—2 cottages. Rents: $260.00.</p>
<p class="indent">On June 1, 1905, plaintiff notified defendant in writing that he exercised the right accorded by said contract regarding the extension of time therein specified, and elected to extend the same for a period of 30 days.</p>
<p class="indent">On June 2, 1905, defendant, by a written instrument served upon plaintiff, revoked said option, and notified him that she withdrew said property from sale.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page648" class="pagebreak">648</div>
<p class="indent">On June 29, 1905, within the extended time, plaintiff left at the residence of defendant an instrument, of which the following is a copy:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">June 29, 1905.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Mrs. M.A. Lott 507 South Olive street, City.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Dear Madame:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Referring to your agreement with me dated February 25, 1905, by which you gave me the privilege of purchasing the south half of lot nine and the whole of lot eight, in block one hundred and one, Bellevue Terrace tract, in this city, I again tender you in gold coin of the United States the sum of $30,000 as provided in said agreement, and demand of you performance on your part as in said agreement provided. This tender will also be made to your attorney, J. Wiseman MacDonald, Esq., as per request this morning when I tendered you $30,000 in gold coin at your residence on said property.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Robert Marsh &amp; Company.</p>
<p class="indent">The contention of appellant is that certain findings are not supported by the evidence. The findings material to a consideration of the case are as follows: The court found that the sum of 25 cents paid for the option was an inadequate and insufficient consideration for the same, and that the said option contract was not just and reasonable to defendant and no adequate consideration was paid to her for it. By finding 9 it appears that</p>
<p class="blockquote">after such revocation and withdrawal of said option, plaintiff, under the name of Robert Marsh &amp; Co., on the 29th day of June, 1905, in an instrument left at the defendant’s house, offered to pay to the defendant the sum of $30,000, and under the said name demanded from defendant a conveyance of the said property, but plaintiff did not at any time actually tender $30,000, or any sum at all in cash, to the defendant, nor did he, in his, or any other name, at any time, tender or offer to defendant any note or mortgage, or other evidence of indebtedness in the amount of $70,000, or any sum at all, either carrying interest at 4½ per cent, net, or at any rate at all, nor did he, in his own name, or any other name, at any time, offer to pay defendant the balance of $70,000, on or before four years from the date of said option, or at any time, with interest at 4½ per cent. net, or with or without interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">And by finding 10 it appears that</p>
<p class="blockquote">plaintiff has not duly or at all performed all and every provision and thing on his part in said option agreement contained. He has made no tender or offer to defendant, save as is set forth in finding No. 9 hereof. Plaintiff is willing to perform the matters on the part of Robert Marsh &amp; Co. to be performed according to the terms of the said option, and is able to pay the sum of thirty thousand dollars.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page649" class="pagebreak">649</div>
<p class="indent">If there was no sufficient consideration for the option, then it was a mere nudum pactum, and defendant’s revocation thereof, notwithstanding her promise to the contrary, was effectual in terminating any right of plaintiff to consummate the purchase.</p>
<p class="indent">If on the other hand, the offer was to remain open a fixed time and was made upon a valuable consideration, equity will ignore the attempted revocation, and treat a subsequent acceptance, made within the time defined in the option, exactly as if no attempted revocation had been made. Subdivision 1 of section 3391, of the Civil Code makes an adequate consideration for the contract one of the conditions for the specific enforcement thereof. The provision, however, has reference to the consideration to be paid for the property, the right to purchase which at a stipulated price within a given time is the subject of the option. It has no application to the sufficiency of the consideration paid for the executed contract, whereby defendant transferred to plaintiff the right to elect to purchase at the stipulated price. It is not the option which it is sought to enforce, but that which, by plaintiff’s acceptance of defendant’s offer, has ripened into an executory contract, whereby, for an adequate consideration, the one agrees to buy and the other agrees to sell. “The sale of an option is an executed contract; that is to say, the lands are not sold, the contract is not executed as to them, but the option is as completely sold and transferred in praesenti as a piece of personal property instantly delivered on payment of the price.” <span class="italic">Ide v. Leiser</span>, 10 Mont. 5. From the very nature of the case no standard exists whereby to determine the adequate value of an option to purchase specific real estate. The land has a market value susceptible of ascertainment, but the value of an option upon a piece of real estate might, and oftentimes does, depend upon proposed or possible improvements in the particular vicinity. To illustrate: If A., having information that the erection of a gigantic department store is contemplated in a certain locality, wishes an option for a specified time to purchase property owned by B. in the vicinity of such proposed improvement, and takes the option on B.’s property at the full market price at the time, must he pay a greater sum therefor because of his knowledge and the fact of B.’s ignorance of the proposed improvement? It is not possible that B., upon learning of the proposed improvement, can, in the absence of facts constituting fraud, etc., revoke or rescind the option upon the claim that he sold and transferred the right specified therein for an inadequate consideration. In our judgment any money consideration, however small, paid and received for an option to purchase property at its adequate value is binding upon the seller thereof for the time specified therein, and is irrevocable for want of its adequacy.</p>
<p class="indent">The provisions of section 3391, Civ.Code, are but a codification of equitable principles that have existed from time immemorial, and the sufficiency of the price paid for an option has never been measured by its adequacy. In Warvelle on Vendors (2d Ed.) § 125, it is said: “If the option is given for a valuable consideration, whether <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page650" class="pagebreak">650</span>adequate or not, it cannot be withdrawn or revoked within the time fixed, and it will be binding and obligatory upon the owner, or his assigns with notice, until it expires by its own limitation.” In <span class="italic">Mathews Slate Co. v. New Empire Slate Co.</span> 122 F. 972, it is said:</p>
<p class="blockquote">writing under seal, by which the one party, in consideration of $1, the payment of which is acknowledged, agrees to sell and convey to the other party within a specified time certain lands and premises, on payment by the other party of a specified consideration, such contract is valid and binding, and ought to be and may be specifically enforced. The seller has the right to fix his price, and covenant and agree that, on receiving that price within a certain time, he will convey the premises, and, if within that time the purchaser of the option tenders the money and demands a conveyance, he is entitled to it. To hold otherwise is to destroy the efficacy of such contracts and agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mr. Freeman in his note to the case of <span class="italic">Mueller v. Nortmann</span>, 96 Am.St.Rep. 997, says:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“An option given by the owner of land for a valuable consideration, whether adequate or not, agreeing to sell it to another at a fixed price if accepted within a specified time, is binding upon the owner and all his successors in interest with knowledge thereof.”</p>
<p class="indent">It therefore follows that the purported revocation made by defendant on June 2, 1905, was ineffectual for the purpose of terminating plaintiff’s right to exercise the privilege of electing to accept the offer prior to the time designated therein for its expiration.</p>
<p class="indent">[Having thus found that the plaintiff gave sufficient consideration for the option, the court went on in the balance of the opinion to consider the terms of the land sale contract covered by the option. After discussing and dismissing various alternative interpretations of this contemplated transaction, the court denied the plaintiff specific performance, arguing somewhat tenuously that the deal would be unjust and inequitable to the defendant because it would compel her to convey title to the land without a written promise by the plaintiff to pay the $70,000 balance of the $100,000 total sales price.]</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment and order are affirmed.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_138" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-138" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a></span></sup></p>

<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, 1985.</p>
<p class="sectionb">761 F.2d 1117.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ P<small>ER</small> C<small>URIAM</small>. This diversity action on a Mississippi contract is before us following the district court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Mid–South Packers, Inc., (Mid–South) and against defendant Shoney’s, Inc., (Shoney’s). We affirm.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The facts, as viewed in the light most favorable to Shoney’s, are as follows. In the spring of 1982, Mid–South and Shoney’s engaged in negotiations for the sale by Mid–South to Shoney’s of various pork products including bacon and ham. A business meeting was held between representatives of the two companies on April 17, 1982, at the offices of Mid–South in Tupelo, Mississippi. The discussion concerned prices and terms at which Mid–South could supply bacon and ham to Shoney’s. At this meeting, Mid–South submitted a letter styled “Proposal” that set forth prices and terms at which Mid–South would supply Shoney’s with various types of meat. The letter also provided that Shoney’s would be informed forty-five days prior to any adjustment in price. The letter contained neither quantity nor durational terms. Shoney’s expressed neither assent to nor rejection of the prices outlined in the letter. Shoney’s estimated its needs from Mid–South at 80,000 pounds of meat per week. The legal effect of the letter proposal is the center of the controversy.</p>
<p class="indent">In July 1982, Shoney’s began purchasing goods from Mid–South. The transactions were initiated by Shoney’s, either through purchase orders or through telephone calls. On the day following each shipment, Mid–South sent invoices to Shoney’s containing additional provisions for payment of both fifteen percent per annum interest on accounts not paid within seven days and reasonable collection costs, including attorney’s fees. Shoney’s bought vast quantities of bacon from Mid–South until August 12, 1982. On that date, Mid–South informed Shoney’s at a meeting of their representatives that the price for future orders of bacon would be raised by $0.10 per pound, due to a previous error in computation by Mid–South. Shoney’s objected to the price modification, apparently in reliance on the forty-five day notice provision contained in the disputed letter proposal. After negotiations, Mid–South agreed to increase the price by only $0.07 per pound. Shoney’s neither agreed nor refused to purchase at the new price. Mid–South’s new proposal was never reduced to writing.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page654" class="pagebreak">654</div>
<p class="indent">On the first Shoney’s purchase order sent after the August 12 meeting, Shoney’s requested shipment at the old lower price. When Mid–South received the purchase order its representative, Morris Ates, called Shoney’s representative, Ray Harmon, and advised Harmon that Mid–South would only deliver at the new higher price. The uncontradicted testimony of Ates is that Harmon told Ates to ship the bacon and to note the higher price on Shoney’s purchase order. The bacon was shipped, and an invoice at the new price followed as did Shoney’s payment, also at the new price.</p>
<p class="indent">From August 18 until October 5, 1982, Shoney’s placed numerous orders for goods, including bacon, with Mid–South. Some if not all of these orders involved telephone conversations between representatives of the two companies, at which time Mid–South again quoted its increased selling price. The telephone conversations were followed by written purchase orders from Shoney’s which quoted both the new price from Mid–South and a price computed at the original amount of $0.07 less per pound. In all cases, the orders were filled by Mid–South and invoiced at the new price. These invoices also included the additional terms providing for interest on delinquent accounts and reasonable collection costs. Shoney’s paid Mid–South’s quoted prices in all instances except the final order. On the final order before Shoney’s began purchasing from another supplier, Shoney’s offset the amount due on the invoice by $26,208, the amount allegedly overcharged on prior orders as a result of the $0.07 price increase.</p>
<p class="indent">Mid–South then brought this action to recover the amount offset plus interest and reasonable collection costs, including attorney’s fees, as provided in the invoices. Shoney’s admits that it owes $8,064.00 of the offset to Mid–South, inasmuch as this amount is attributable to orders placed after the expiration of the forty-five day notice period which, Shoney’s contends, commenced on August 12 when Mid–South asked for the price increase.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Shoney’s contends that it accepted the proposal of Mid–South to supply it meat by placing orders with Mid–South, thereby forming a binding contract between the parties. Shoney’s characterizes the contract as a “requirements contract” and asserts that the quantity term under the contract was that amount it reasonably and in good faith required. Accordingly, Shoney’s argues that the notice provision contained in the letter proposal contractually bound Mid–South to notify Shoney’s forty-five days before increasing its prices.</p>
<p class="indent">Mid–South asserts that the proposal was at most a “firm offer.” Mid–South argues that under Uniform Commercial Code § 2–205, (hereinafter referred to as U.C.C. or the Code), a firm offer is irrevocable despite a lack of consideration “during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time; but in no event may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page655" class="pagebreak">655</span>such period of irrevocability exceed three (3) months.” Thus, Mid–South contends that under any construction of the document, the offer must have expired three months after April 17, 1982, the date of the letter proposal, or on approximately July 17, 1982; therefore, it asserts the right on August 12, 1982, to increase the selling price without notice.</p>
<p class="indent">The district court, on consideration of cross summary judgment motions, adopted Mid–South’s theory, holding that no long-term requirements contract was created and that each purchase order constituted a separate contract for the amount stated at the price required by Mid–South.</p>
<p class="indent">Requirements contracts are recognized in Mississippi and are not void for indefiniteness. However, an essential element of a requirements contract is the promise of the buyer to purchase exclusively from the seller either the buyer’s entire requirements or up to a specified amount. Absent such a commitment, the requirements contract fails for want of consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">Ray Harmon, Shoney’s agent in the transaction, maintained that Shoney’s at all times had the right to purchase goods from suppliers other than Mid–South, that Shoney’s continued to purchase from Mid–South because it was satisfied with its service and the quality of its goods, and that the purchase orders sent by Shoney’s to Mid–South beginning in July 1982 “would have been the only commitment (Shoney’s) would have made.” Mid–South agrees that Shoney’s had the right to change suppliers. Thus, by Shoney’s own admission, no requirements contract could have arisen from the April 17 letter proposal and the meeting at which it was discussed.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the Code, the letter proposal and surrounding negotiations constituted, at most, a “firm offer” which was irrevocable, without consideration, only for a period of three months commencing on April 17 and ending on July 17, 1982. Thus, Mid–South had the right, after July 17, to raise its offered price as it did and the district court was correct in so holding.</p>
<p class="indent">The district court was also correct in holding that each purchase order stood on its own as a contract between Shoney’s and Mid–South. More specifically, Mid–South’s letter proposal was its offer in the sense that it was a promise to sell at the listed prices, justifying Shoney’s in understanding that its assent, i.e., its purchase orders or telephone calls, would close the bargain. Thus, each time Shoney’s manifested its assent, in telephone calls or purchase orders to Mid–South, a new and independent contract between the parties was created.</p>
<p class="indent">Mid–South’s offer, held open in its discretion at least after July 17, was properly revoked and replaced by the offer of a seven-cent price increase at the August 12 meeting. Shoney’s accepted this new offer for the first time on August 18 when Harmon, having been informed by Ates that Mid–South would not sell except at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page656" class="pagebreak">656</span>new price, ordered shipment. Thereafter, Shoney’s created separate contracts and obligated itself to pay the new price each time it mailed purchase orders with that price noted on them. Shoney’s practice of also noting the old price on the purchase orders had no contractual significance since Harmon admitted that the practice was “a tracking procedure” used by Shoney’s internally in order to determine the difference between the old price and the new. Ates’ testimony is uncontradicted that Harmon also told him this.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, Harmon admitted that Shoney’s ordered at and paid the new price with the intention of causing Mid–South to believe that Shoney’s had accepted the new price so that the shipments would continue; and Mid–South attached precisely that significance to Shoney’s conduct. Shoney’s secretly harbored intent to later deduct the difference between the old and new price could not bind Mid–South. Conduct may bind a party to a contract if it “show[s] agreement.” “Agreement” of the parties must be manifested either in language or conduct in the circumstances. The only manifestations Shoney’s made were those consistent with assent to Mid–South’s new offer. Finally, the parties’ “course of performance” is consistent only with Mid–South’s expressed offer and Shoney’s expressed acceptance of the new price.</p>
<p class="indent">Shoney’s remedy under the circumstances was either to reserve whatever right it might have had to the old price by sending its purchase orders with an “explicit reservation,” or to find a supplier who would sell at an acceptable price. No rational theory of the law of contracts could permit Shoney’s to manifest acceptance of Mid–South’s new offer, thus inducing performance, and then revoke that acceptance and demand compliance with the terms of the prior, withdrawn offer. Hence, the entire $26,208 offset by Shoney’s is due and owing Mid–South and the district court’s judgment, to this extent, was proper.</p>

<h4 id="sec321" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">D.   O<small>PTIONS</small> P<small>URCHASED BY</small> B<small>EGINNING</small> P<small>ERFORMANCE</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">When an offer proposes an exchange of promises, the general rule is that the offer may be withdrawn anytime up to the delivery of the requested return promise. So if I promise you $500 if you promise to sell me your cow, you can cut off my power to withdraw the offer by promising to sell me the cow as requested. Until you give me the promise I seek, I am free to call off the deal.</p>
<p class="indent">Consideration may also consist of a performance instead of a promise. At what point in time is the power to withdraw the offer terminated when a prolonged performance (rather than a promise to perform) is requested? Suppose I promise to pay you $500 if you paint my house. We might interpret this offer as calling for acceptance by delivery of a promise to paint my house (and this is the usually preferred interpretation for reasons that will become obvious when we see how complicated the alternative can be). If you start to paint (rather than expressly promise to paint), we can imply from your conduct the requested promise. If we treat the agreement this way, both sides are bound when the promises are exchanged. But we could also interpret this offer as calling for acceptance only by performance, that is, by you painting the house. If we treat it that way, must you completely paint the house to accept the offer and bind me? Can I sit by as you carry in all your paints, ladders, and drop cloths and then revoke the offer before you start to paint? Can I sit by calmly while you paint 98.7% of the house and then, as you dip your brush for the last time, notify you that I revoke my offer?</p>
<p class="indent">When the requested performance is prolonged in time, there is a great potential for unfairness if the offeror may revoke his offer after the other party has expended time and effort in part performance. While the inclination to bind the offeror is therefore strong, there is an understandable reluctance to bind the offeree to complete his performance. If he decides halfway through the job that he doesn’t want to paint your house and isn’t interested in the $500, why shouldn’t he be permitted to abandon the effort? After all, he didn’t <span class="bold"><span class="italic">promise</span></span> to paint your house.</p>
<p class="indent">Binding the offeror but not the offeree offends a sense of symmetry dear to the legal mind. This sense of symmetry is embodied in a number of places in classical contract law doctrine, particularly in the concept of “mutuality of obligation” and in the distinction between “unilateral” and “bilateral” contracts. Both of these concepts are generally discredited and we avoid them in this Casebook because their use tends to create more problems than solutions. You will encounter them in many judicial opinions, however, and should be aware of the underlying problem they describe.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page658" class="pagebreak">658</div>
<p class="indent">Basically three approaches to the problems created by an offer of a promise in exchange for performance rather than a return promise exist:</p>
<p class="blockquote">(a) The strictly logical view that if a performance and not a promise is requested, no contract is formed and neither side is bound until the requested performance is complete and both sides are bound.</p>
<p class="blockquote">(b) The view that once the requested performance has substantially begun, both offeror and offeree are bound in a complete contract to the entire undertaking. This view binds the offeree to a promise he may never have intended to make and gives little weight to the difference between an offer calling for a performance and one calling for a promise in response.</p>
<p class="blockquote">(c) The third view, embodied in <span id="sec322" />Restatement, Second, Contracts § 45, treats an offer of this sort as creating an option contract when the offeree begins performance. Exercise of the option is conditioned on the completion of the performance as requested in the offer. During the course of performance the offeror cannot revoke the offer. Sometimes it is said that the offer calling for performance as the consideration implicitly contains a subsidiary promise to keep the offer open while performance is being tendered. Under this view, the offeror is bound from the time performance begins because he has received as consideration the beginning of performance by the offeree. Nonetheless, the offeree is free to withdraw anytime up to completion of performance.</p>

<p id="sec324" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Drennan v. Star Paving Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Supreme Court, 1958.</p>
<p class="sectionb">51 Cal.2d 409, 333 P.2d 757.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ T<small>RAYNOR</small>, J. Defendant appeals from a judgment for plaintiff in an action to recover damages caused by defendant’s refusal to perform certain paving work according to a bid it submitted to plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">On July 28, 1955, plaintiff, a licensed general contractor, was preparing a bid on the “Monte Vista School Job” in the Lancaster school district. Bids had to be submitted before 8 p.m. Plaintiff testified that it was customary in that area for general contractors to receive the bids of subcontractors by telephone on the day set for bidding and to rely on them in computing their own bids. Thus on that day plaintiff’s secretary, Mrs. Johnson, received by telephone between 50 and 75 subcontractors’ bids for various parts of the school job. As each bid came in, she wrote it on a special form, which she brought into plaintiff’s office. He then posted it on a master cost sheet setting forth the names and bids of all subcontractors. His own bid had to include the names of subcontractors who were to perform one-half of one per cent or more of the construction work, and he had also to provide a bidder’s bond of 10 per cent of his total bid of $317,385 as a guarantee that he would enter the contract if awarded the work.</p>
<p class="indent">Late in the afternoon, Mrs. Johnson had a telephone conversation with Kenneth R. Moon, an estimator for defendant. He gave his name and telephone number and stated that he was bidding for defendant for the paving work at the Monte Vista School according to plans and specifications and that his bid was $7,131.60. At Mrs. Johnson’s request he repeated his bid. Plaintiff listened to the bid over an extension telephone in his office and posted it on the master sheet after receiving the bid form from Mrs. Johnson. Defendant’s was the lowest bid for the paving. Plaintiff computed his own bid accordingly and submitted it with the name of defendant as the subcontractor for the paving. When the bids were opened on July 28th, plaintiff’s proved to be the lowest, and he was awarded the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">On his way to Los Angeles the next morning plaintiff stopped at defendant’s office. The first person he met was defendant’s construction engineer, Mr. Oppenheimer. Plaintiff testified: “I introduced myself and he immediately told me that they had made a mistake in their bid to me the night before, they couldn’t do it for the price they had bid, and I told him I would expect him to carry through with their original bid because I had used it in compiling my bid and the job was being awarded <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page660" class="pagebreak">660</span>them. And I would have to go and do the job according to my bid and I would expect them to do the same.”</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant refused to do the paving work for less than $15,000. Plaintiff testified that he “got figures from other people” and after trying for several months to get as low a bid as possible engaged L &amp; H Paving Company, a firm in Lancaster, to do the work for $10,948.60.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court found on substantial evidence that defendant made a definite offer to do the paving on the Monte Vista job according to the plans and specifications for $7,131.60, and that plaintiff relied on defendant’s bid in computing his own bid for the school job and naming defendant therein as the subcontractor for the paving work. Accordingly, it entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of $3,817 (the difference between defendant’s bid and the cost of the paving to plaintiff) plus costs.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant contends that there was no enforceable contract between the parties on the ground that it made a revocable offer and revoked it before plaintiff communicated his acceptance to defendant.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no evidence that defendant offered to make its bid irrevocable in exchange for plaintiff’s use of its figures in computing his bid. Nor is there evidence that would warrant interpreting plaintiff’s use of defendant’s bid as the acceptance thereof, binding plaintiff, on condition he received the main contract, to award the subcontract to defendant. In sum, there was neither an option supported by consideration nor a bilateral contract binding on both parties.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff contends, however, that he relied to his detriment on defendant’s offer and that defendant must therefore answer in damages for its refusal to perform. Thus the question is squarely presented: Did plaintiff’s reliance make defendant’s offer irrevocable?</p>
<p class="indent">Section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts states: “A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.” This rule applies in this state.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s offer constituted a promise to perform on such conditions as were stated expressly or by implication therein or annexed thereto by operation of law. Defendant had reason to expect that if its bid proved the lowest it would be used by plaintiff. It induced “action * * * of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee.”</p>
<p class="indent">Had defendant’s bid expressly stated or clearly implied that it was revocable at any time before acceptance we would treat it accordingly. It was silent on revocation, however, and we must therefore determine whether there are conditions to the right <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page661" class="pagebreak">661</span>of revocation imposed by law or reasonably inferable in fact. In the analogous problem of an offer for a unilateral contract, the theory is now obsolete that the offer is revocable at any time before complete performance. Thus section 45 of the Restatement of Contracts provides:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">If an offer for unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given or tendered by the offeree in response thereto, the offeror is bound by a contract, the duty of immediate performance of which is conditional on the full consideration being given or tendered within the time stated in the offer, or, if no time is stated therein, within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="blockquote">In explanation, comment b states that the</p>
<p class="blockquote">main offer includes as a subsidiary promise, necessarily implied, that if part of the requested performance is given, the offeror will not revoke his offer, and that if tender is made it will be accepted. Part performance or tender may thus furnish consideration for the subsidiary promise. Moreover, merely acting in justifiable reliance on an offer may in some cases serve as sufficient reason for making a promise binding (see § 90).</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether implied in fact or law, the subsidiary promise serves to preclude the injustice that would result if the offer could be revoked after the offeree had acted in detrimental reliance thereon. Reasonable reliance resulting in a foreseeable prejudicial change in position affords a compelling basis also for implying a subsidiary promise not to revoke an offer for a bilateral contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The absence of consideration is not fatal to the enforcement of such a promise. It is true that in the case of unilateral contracts the Restatement finds consideration for the implied subsidiary promise in the part performance of the bargained-for exchange, but its reference to section 90 makes clear that consideration for such a promise is not always necessary. The very purpose of section 90 is to make a promise binding even though there was no consideration “in the sense of something that is bargained for and given in exchange.” Reasonable reliance serves to hold the offeror in lieu of the consideration ordinarily required to make the offer binding. In a case involving similar facts the Supreme Court of South Dakota stated that</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">we believe that reason and justice demand that the doctrine [of section 90] be applied to the present facts. We cannot believe that by accepting this doctrine as controlling in the state of facts before us we will abolish the requirement of a consideration in contract cases, in any different sense than an ordinary estoppel abolishes some legal requirement in its application. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the defendants in executing the agreement [which was not supported by consideration] made a promise which they should have reasonably expected would induce the plaintiff to submit a bid based thereon to the Government, that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page662" class="pagebreak">662</span>such promise did induce this action, and that injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.</p>
<p class="indent">When plaintiff used defendant’s offer in computing his own bid, he bound himself to perform in reliance on defendant’s terms. Though defendant did not bargain for this use of its bid neither did defendant make it idly, indifferent to whether it would be used or not. On the contrary it is reasonable to suppose that defendant submitted its bid to obtain the subcontract. It was bound to realize the substantial possibility that its bid would be the lowest, and that it would be included by plaintiff in his bid. It was to its own interest that the contractor be awarded the general contract; the lower the subcontract bid, the lower the general contractor’s bid was likely to be and the greater its chance of acceptance and hence the greater defendant’s chance of getting the paving subcontract. Defendant had reason not only to expect plaintiff to rely on its bid but to want him to. Clearly defendant had a stake in plaintiff’s reliance on its bid. Given this interest and the fact that plaintiff is bound by his own bid, it is only fair that plaintiff should have at least an opportunity to accept defendant’s bid after the general contract has been awarded to him.</p>
<p class="indent">It bears noting that a general contractor is not free to delay acceptance after he has been awarded the general contract in the hope of getting a better price. Nor can he reopen bargaining with the subcontractor and at the same time claim a continuing right to accept the original offer. In the present case plaintiff promptly informed defendant that plaintiff was being awarded the job and that the subcontract was being awarded to defendant.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant contends, however, that its bid was the result of mistake and that it was therefore entitled to revoke it. It relies on the rescission cases. In those cases, however, the bidder’s mistake was known or should have been to the offeree, and the offeree could be placed in status quo. Of course, if plaintiff had reason to believe that defendant’s bid was in error, he could not justifiably rely on it, and section 90 would afford no basis for enforcing it. Plaintiff, however, had no reason to know that defendant had made a mistake in submitting its bid, since there was usually a variance of 160 per cent between the highest and lowest bids for paving in the desert around Lancaster. He committed himself to performing the main contract in reliance on defendant’s figures. Under these circumstances defendant’s mistake, far from relieving it of its obligation constitutes an additional reason for enforcing it, for it misled plaintiff as to the cost of doing the paving. Even had it been clearly understood that defendant’s offer was revocable until accepted, it would not necessarily follow that defendant had no duty to exercise reasonable care in preparing its bid. It presented its bid with knowledge of the substantial possibility that it would be used by plaintiff; it could foresee the harm that would ensue from an erroneous underestimate of the cost. Moreover, it was motivated by its own business interest. Whether or not these considerations alone would justify recovery for negligence had the case <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page663" class="pagebreak">663</span>been tried on that theory, they are persuasive that defendant’s mistake should not defeat recovery under the rule of section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts. As between the subcontractor who made the bid and the general contractor who reasonably relied on it, the loss resulting from the mistake should fall on the party who caused it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Leo F. Piazza Paving Co. v. Bebek &amp; Brkich</span> and <span class="italic">Bard v. Kent</span> are not to the contrary. In the <span class="italic">Piazza</span> case the court sustained a finding that defendants intended, not to make a firm bid, but only to give the plaintiff “some kind of an idea to use” in making its bid; there was evidence that the defendants had told plaintiff they were unsure of the significance of the specifications. There was thus no offer, promise, or representation on which the defendants should reasonably have expected the plaintiff to rely. The <span class="italic">Bard</span> case held that an option not supported by consideration was revoked by the death of the optionor. The issue of recovery under the rule of section 90 was not pleaded at the trial, and it does not appear that the offeree’s reliance was “of a definite and substantial character” so that injustice could be avoided “only by the enforcement of the promise.”</p>
<p class="indent">There is no merit in defendant’s contention that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action, on the ground that the complaint failed to allege that plaintiff attempted to mitigate the damages or that they could not have been mitigated. Plaintiff alleged that after defendant’s default, “plaintiff had to procure the services of the L &amp; H Co. to perform said asphaltic paving for the sum of $10,948.60.” Plaintiff’s uncontradicted evidence showed that he spent several months trying to get bids from other subcontractors and that he took the lowest bid. Clearly he acted reasonably to mitigate damages….</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment is affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec325" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Does the problem of the mistaken subcontractor’s bid have to be decided on the basis of whether there was consideration? What alternative bases for decision are suggested by Chapter One? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Do you think the problem of subcontractors’ bids would be better solved by a special rule or statute for this specific problem than by reference to the general law of contract formation and consideration? If so, what should the statute provide?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. After this decision, Star Paving executives may wonder how, in a situation when they are seeking to conclude a bargain, they can be bound if the other party relies on their offer even before there is a bargain. How would you explain this apparent paradox to the folks at Star Paving? Is the paradox avoidable? Is it in Star <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page664" class="pagebreak">664</span>Paving’s best interest to avoid it? What additional information would you like in answering this last question?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Did Star Paving ever promise that its bid would be irrevocable? Are all subcontractors’ bids in California to be interpreted as containing an implied promise of irrevocability after this case?</p>

<p id="sec328" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Hill v. Gateway 2000</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1997.</p>
<p class="sectionb">105 F.3d 1147.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ E<small>ASTERBROOK</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">A customer picks up the phone, orders a computer, and gives a credit card number. Presently a box arrives, containing the computer and a list of terms, said to govern unless the customer returns the computer within 30 days. Are these terms <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page665" class="pagebreak">665</span>effective as the parties’ contract, or is the contract term-free because the order-taker did not read any terms over the phone and elicit the customer’s assent?</p>
<p class="indent">One of the terms in the box containing a Gateway 2000 system was an arbitration clause. Rich and Enza Hill, the customers, kept the computer more than 30 days before complaining about its components and performance. They filed suit in federal court arguing, among other things, that the product’s shortcomings make Gateway a racketeer (mail and wire fraud are said to be the predicate offenses), leading to treble damages under RICO for the Hills and a class of all other purchasers. Gateway asked the district court to enforce the arbitration clause; the judge refused, writing that “[t]he present record is insufficient to support a finding of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties or that the plaintiffs were given adequate notice of the arbitration clause.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Hills say that the arbitration clause did not stand out: they concede noticing the statement of terms but deny reading it closely enough to discover the agreement to arbitrate, and they ask us to conclude that they therefore may go to court. Yet an agreement to arbitrate must be enforced “save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2. <span class="italic">Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,</span> holds that this provision of the Federal Arbitration Act is inconsistent with any requirement that an arbitration clause be prominent. A contract need not be read to be effective; people who accept take the risk that the unread terms may in retrospect prove unwelcome. Terms inside Gateway’s box stand or fall together. If they constitute the parties’ contract because the Hills had an opportunity to return the computer after reading them, then all must be enforced.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg</span> holds that terms inside a box of software bind consumers who use the software after an opportunity to read the terms and to reject them by returning the product. Likewise, <span class="italic">Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute</span> enforces a forum-selection clause that was included among three pages of terms attached to a cruise ship ticket. <span class="italic">ProCD</span> and <span class="italic">Carnival Cruise Lines</span> exemplify the many commercial transactions in which people pay for products with terms to follow; <span class="italic">ProCD</span> discusses others. The district court concluded in <span class="italic">ProCD</span> that the contract is formed when the consumer pays for the software; as a result, the court held, only terms known to the consumer at that moment are part of the contract, and provisos inside the box do not count. Although this is one way a contract could be formed, it is not the only way: “A vendor, as master of the offer, may invite acceptance by conduct, and may propose limitations on the kind of conduct that constitutes acceptance. A buyer may accept by performing the acts the vendor proposes to treat as acceptance.” Gateway shipped computers with the same sort of accept-or-return offer ProCD made to users of its software. <span class="italic">ProCD</span> relied on the Uniform Commercial Code rather than any peculiarities of Wisconsin law; both Illinois and South Dakota, the two states whose law might govern relations between Gateway and the Hills, have adopted the UCC; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page666" class="pagebreak">666</span>neither side has pointed us to any atypical doctrines in those states that might be pertinent; <span class="italic">ProCD</span> therefore applies to this dispute.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs ask us to limit <span class="italic">ProCD</span> to software, but where’s the sense in that? <span class="italic">ProCD</span> is about the law of contract, not the law of software. Payment preceding the revelation of full terms is common for air transportation, insurance, and many other endeavors. Practical considerations support allowing vendors to enclose the full legal terms with their products. Cashiers cannot be expected to read legal documents to customers before ringing up sales. If the staff at the other end of the phone for direct-sales operations such as Gateway’s had to read the four-page statement of terms before taking the buyer’s credit card number, the droning voice would anesthetize rather than enlighten many potential buyers. Others would hang up in a rage over the waste of their time. And oral recitation would not avoid customers’ assertions (whether true or feigned) that the clerk did not read term X to them, or that they did not remember or understand it. Writing provides benefits for both sides of commercial transactions. Customers as a group are better off when vendors skip costly and ineffectual steps such as telephonic recitation, and use instead a simple approve-or-return device. Competent adults are bound by such documents, read or unread. For what little it is worth, we add that the box from Gateway was crammed with software. The computer came with an operating system, without which it was useful only as a boat anchor. Gateway also included many application programs. So the Hills’ effort to limit <span class="italic">ProCD</span> to software would not avail them factually, even if it were sound legally—which it is not.</p>
<p class="indent">For their second sally, the Hills contend that ProCD should be limited to executory contracts (to licenses in particular), and therefore does not apply because both parties’ performance of this contract was complete when the box arrived at their home. This is legally and factually wrong: legally because the question at hand concerns the <span class="italic">formation</span> of the contract rather than its <span class="italic">performance</span>, and factually because both contracts were incompletely performed. <span class="italic">ProCD</span> did not depend on the fact that the seller characterized the transaction as a license rather than as a contract; we treated it as a contract for the sale of goods and reserved the question whether for other purposes a “license” characterization might be preferable. All debates about characterization to one side, the transaction in <span class="italic">ProCD</span> was no more executory than the one here: Zeidenberg paid for the software and walked out of the store with a box under his arm, so if arrival of the box with the product ends the time for revelation of contractual terms, then the time ended in <span class="italic">ProCD</span> before Zeidenberg opened the box. But of course ProCD had not completed performance with delivery of the box, and neither had Gateway. One element of the transaction was the warranty, which obliges sellers to fix defects in their products. The Hills have invoked Gateway’s warranty and are not satisfied with its response, so they are not well positioned to say that Gateway’s obligations were fulfilled when the motor carrier <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page667" class="pagebreak">667</span>unloaded the box. What is more, both ProCD and Gateway promised to help customers to use their products. Long-term service and information obligations are common in the computer business, on both hardware and software sides. Gateway offers “lifetime service” and has a round-the-clock telephone hotline to fulfill this promise. Some vendors spend more money helping customers use their products than on developing and manufacturing them. The document in Gateway’s box includes promises of future performance that some consumers value highly; these promises bind Gateway just as the arbitration clause binds the Hills.</p>
<p class="indent">Next the Hills insist that <span class="italic">ProCD</span> is irrelevant because Zeidenberg was a “merchant” and they are not. Section 2-207(2) of the UCC, the infamous battle-of-theforms section, states that “additional terms [following acceptance of an offer] are to be construed as proposals for addition to a contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless ….” Plaintiffs tell us that <span class="italic">ProCD</span> came out as it did only because Zeidenberg was a “merchant” and the terms inside ProCD’s box were not excluded by the “unless” clause. This argument pays scant attention to the opinion in <span class="italic">ProCD,</span> which concluded that, when there is only one form, “sec. 2-207 is irrelevant.” 86 F.3d at 1452. The question in <span class="italic">ProCD</span> was not whether terms were added to a contract after its formation, but how and when the contract was formed—in particular, whether a vendor may propose that a contract of sale be formed, not in the store (or over the phone) with the payment of money or a general “send me the product,” but after the customer has had a chance to inspect both the item and the terms. <span class="italic">ProCD</span> answers “yes,” for merchants and consumers alike. Yet again, for what little it is worth we observe that the Hills misunderstand the setting of <span class="italic">ProCD.</span> A “merchant” under the UCC “means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction,” § 2-104(1). Zeidenberg bought the product at a retail store, an uncommon place for merchants to acquire inventory. His corporation put ProCD’s database on the Internet for anyone to browse, which led to the litigation but did not make Zeidenberg a software merchant.</p>
<p class="indent">At oral argument the Hills propounded still another distinction: the box containing ProCD’s software displayed a notice that additional terms were within, while the box containing Gateway’s computer did not. The difference is functional, not legal. Consumers browsing the aisles of a store can look at the box, and if they are unwilling to deal with the prospect of additional terms can leave the box alone, avoiding the transactions costs of returning the package after reviewing its contents. Gateway’s box, by contrast, is just a shipping carton; it is not on display anywhere. Its function is to protect the product during transit, and the information on its sides is for the use of handlers (Fragile! This Side Up!) rather than would-be purchasers.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page668" class="pagebreak">668</div>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the Hills would have had a better argument if they were first alerted to the bundling of hardware and legal-ware after opening the box and wanted to return the computer in order to avoid disagreeable terms, but were dissuaded by the expense of shipping. What the remedy would be in such a case—could it exceed the shipping charges? is an interesting question, but one that need not detain us because the Hills knew before they ordered the computer that the carton would include <span class="italic">some</span> important terms, and they did not seek to discover these in advance. Gateway’s ads state that their products come with limited warranties and lifetime support. How limited was the warranty: 30 days, with service contingent on shipping the computer back, or five years, with free onsite service? What sort of support was offered? Shoppers have three principal ways to discover these things. First, they can ask the vendor to send a copy before deciding whether to buy. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act requires firms to distribute their warranty terms on request; the Hills do not contend that Gateway would have refused to enclose the remaining terms too. Concealment would be bad for business, scaring some customers away and leading to excess returns from others. Second, shoppers can consult public sources (computer magazines, the Web sites of vendors) that may contain this information. Third, they may inspect the documents after the product’s delivery. Like Zeidenberg, the Hills took the third option. By keeping the computer beyond 30 days, the Hills accepted Gateway’s offer, including the arbitration clause.</p>
<p class="indent">The Hills’ remaining arguments, including a contention that the arbitration clause is unenforceable as part of a scheme to defraud, do not require more than a citation to <span class="italic">Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</span> 388 U.S. 395 (1967). Whatever may be said pro and con about the cost and efficacy of arbitration (which the Hills disparage) is for Congress and the contracting parties to consider. Claims based on RICO are no less arbitrable than those founded on the contract or the law of torts. The decision of the district court is vacated, and this case is remanded with instructions to compel the Hills to submit their dispute to arbitration.</p>
<p id="sec329" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Didn’t the Hills have the legal right to retain the computer they had paid for based upon the original terms of the deal? How can Gateway turn the Hills’ exercise of that right into assent to new and additional terms by delivering the new terms with the computer? Compare <span class="italic">Klocek v. Gateway</span>, 104 F. Supp. 2d 1332 (D. Kan. 2000) (holding on nearly identical facts that Gateway’s standard terms did not become part of the contract on account of customer’s failure to return computer). Note that CISG Art. 18(1), p. 699, appears to specifically reject Gateway’s tactic of unilaterally declaring that retention of the goods amounts to affirmative consent to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page669" class="pagebreak">669</span>new unbargained-for terms: “Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What if, instead of an arbitration clause, the fine print enclosed with the box said: “Unless this computer is returned to Gateway in its original packing within 30 days, Customer agrees that Gateway shall be Customer’s exclusive computer supplier for 10 years. Purchase of a computer from any other source shall result in liquidated damages of $1000 to Gateway for each such instance”? Can Gateway stick any term it wants, relevant or not to the purchase of the computer, into the fine print and enforce it against the Hills based on the Hills’ supposed acceptance of Gateway’s “offer” manifested solely by the Hills’ retention of the computer the Hills had already paid for? Lest you consider this hypothetical remote and remain confident that an efficient market will prevent such overreaching by sellers, consider the terms of the subsequent Gateway 2000 arbitration clause at issue in <span class="italic">Brower v. Gateway 2000</span>, 676 N.Y.S.2d 569 (App. Div. 1998). That clause required all United States Gateway buyers to arbitrate their claims in Chicago, Illinois under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The ICC (a respected institution in international commercial arbitration) requires that all the claimant’s paperwork be mailed to ICC offices in France along with a $4000 arbitration fee, only $2000 of which might be refunded if the consumer prevailed after traveling to Chicago for the arbitration hearing. Although the New York courts found that this outrageous arbitration clause buried in the boilerplate was properly assented to under the UCC, they also found the clause unconscionable and refused to enforce it. But that was before the Supreme Court of the United States decided <span class="italic">Concepcion</span>, p. 266 which has limited application of the unconscionability defense to arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. What if, in lieu of returning the Gateway computer, the Hills had sent a letter to Gateway’s customer service department stating that they rejected the additional terms set forth in the package but were otherwise satisfied with the computer and would retain it based solely on the terms originally negotiated over the phone?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Sellers commonly reserve to themselves the right to unilaterally modify certain contract terms by providing notice to consumers. We are all familiar with envelope stuffers disclosing new terms that purport to bind buyers of wireless services, bank customers, credit cardholders and the like. Those terms are asserted to become binding on the consumer unless the contract is terminated promptly, even if termination is costly to the consumer. Are those new terms binding or not? How can one side reserve to itself the right to unilaterally impose new or different unbargained-for terms on notice to its counterparty notwithstanding reliance? If the seller can do this does it matter at all what the original contract provides? On the other <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page670" class="pagebreak">670</span>hand, don’t sellers in a national marketplace need to provide goods and services on a uniform set of terms to both existing and future customers?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. The problem of enforcing unbargained-for “standard” terms in consumer contracts is an old and universal problem that keeps re-emerging in new contexts. It is common nowadays, for example, that in order to complete a transaction over the internet, a consumer must click on a “button” that says “I Agree” to standard terms that no one reads and that the seller knows no one reads. Those terms may be reasonable or not, but invariably they are drawn with an eye towards maximizing the legal position of the seller. Although market forces and consumer protection legislation may limit how far sellers can go in imposing onerous or non-germane unbargained-for terms, as <span class="italic">Hill v. Gateway</span> illustrates, the consumer can take little comfort that traditional American contract law will protect him from such terms in all but the most egregious circumstances. The nations within the European Community seem to take a more restrictive view: Article 6 of the E<small>UROPEAN</small> C<small>OMMUNITY</small> C<small>OUNCIL</small> D<small>IRECTIVE</small> 93/13/EEC (Apr. 5, 1993) provides: “Member States shall lay down that unfair terms used in a contract concluded with a consumer by a seller or supplier shall … not be binding on the consumer….” “Unfair terms” include a lengthy non-exclusive list of specific types of provisions set forth in the Directive’s Annex (including certain types of mandatory arbitration provisions), as well as any “contractual term which has not been individually negotiated … if contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.” <span class="italic">Id.</span> at Art. 3(1). The G<small>ERMAN</small> C<small>IVIL</small> C<small>ODE</small> [BGB] §§ 305-310 adopts this approach to the problem as well. An attempt to incorporate similar concepts into the proposed 2003 version of UCC Article 2 was defeated by strong opposition from certain business sectors. See UCC Art. 2 Discussion Draft § 2-206 (Nov. 1996) (“When a consumer manifests assent to a standard form, a term contained in the form which the consumer could not reasonably have expected is not part of the contract unless the consumer expressly agrees to it.”).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Judge Easterbrook rather casually dismisses the Hills’ unconscionability argument. Note that <span class="italic">Hill</span> was a consumer class action case, and the arbitration clause imposed by Gateway had the effect of precluding class-wide relief. It is hard to imagine how individual arbitrations could ever vindicate consumer claims not involving personal injuries for transactions of this type. The enforceability of arbitration clauses in such circumstances remains controversial. <span class="italic">See</span> Note, p. 264.</p>

<p id="sec330" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Beard Implement Co. v. Krusa</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Appellate Court of Illinois, Fourth District, 1991.</p>
<p class="sectionb">208 Ill.App.3d 953, 153 Ill.Dec. 387, 567 N.E.2d 345.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ J<small>USTICE</small> S<small>TEIGMANN</small> delivered the opinion of the court:</p>
<p class="indent">This action involves an alleged breach of contract between plaintiff seller, Beard Implement Company, Inc., a farm implement dealership, and defendant buyer, Carl Krusa, a farmer, for the purchase of a 1985 Deutz–Allis N–5 combine. The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the trial court in a bench trial erred in finding a contract existed between the parties. Specifically, defendant contends that plaintiff never accepted defendant’s offer to purchase the combine. We agree and reverse.</p>
<p class="indent">At trial, defendant testified that between December 20 and December 23, 1985, he had several conversations with plaintiff’s representatives concerning the purchase of a new combine. Defendant owned a 1980 Deutz–Allis N–5 combine at that time. In fall 1985, both spindles on his combine had broken and defendant spoke with plaintiff’s representatives about repairing them.</p>
<p class="indent">On December 23, 1985, defendant met with plaintiff’s representatives at plaintiff’s office in Arenzville, Illinois. Defendant testified that one of plaintiff’s representatives, either Jim Beard or Gerry Beard, filled out a purchase order for a new combine for the price of $52,800 cash and the trade-in of the combine defendant then owned. (See appendix for a copy of this order.) Defendant signed the Allis–Chalmers purchase order, which was dated December 23, 1985. None of plaintiff’s representatives signed that order on December 23, 1985, or at any time thereafter. The bottom left corner of this order reads as follows:</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><span style="padding-left:85px" />______________________</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><span style="padding-left:85px" />DEALER’S SALESMAN</p>
<p class="fn_txt">This order subject to acceptance by dealer.</p>
<p class="fn_txt">Accepted by: ______________________</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><span style="padding-left:120px" />DEALER</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time defendant signed the purchase order, he also signed a counter check drawn on a local bank in the amount of $5,200. Defendant testified that because he did not have his checkbook, plaintiff provided him with the counter check. The check was undated and intended to represent a down payment on the combine. Defendant testified that the check was not dated because he was to call plaintiff later and let plaintiff know if he wanted to proceed with the transaction. At that time, plaintiff would put a date on the check.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant testified that he had misgivings over the Christmas weekend and, after discussing the situation with his wife, telephoned plaintiff’s manager, Duane Hess, on December 26, 1985, and told Hess that he did not wish to proceed with the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page672" class="pagebreak">672</span>transaction. Defendant explained to Hess that defendant and his wife had determined that “the price was too high” and they “did not want to go further into debt to finance the transaction.” Defendant testified that Hess told him that if defendant thought the combine was too expensive, Hess would let defendant out of the deal. Hess did not indicate whether he had signed the order.</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier on December 26, 1985, defendant had met with a representative of Cox Implement Company. Defendant identified a copy of the order form that one of Cox’s salesman had filled out. This order was dated December 26, 1985, but was signed on December 27. Defendant testified that he told Cox’s salesman that his price was too high and that defendant could not go through with either that bid or plaintiff’s bid. However, after Cox’s quoted price was reduced and the figures on the purchase order were scratched out, defendant signed the purchase order with Cox on December 27, 1985. Defendant stated the agreement with Cox was for the same model combine he was negotiating for with plaintiff but at a lower price. He wanted to consummate the transaction by December 31, 1985, in order to take advantage of the investment tax credit.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant wrote a letter to plaintiff that was dated December 26, 1985, but sent on December 27, 1985. That letter read as follows:</p>
<p class="bqs">Dec. 26, ‘85</p>
<p class="bqs">Dear Sirs:</p>
<p class="bqsi">As I told you by phone on Dec. 26, ‘85, I do not wish to purchase the 1985 N–5 combine we talked about so please send me the uncashed counter check on the Bank of Bluffs for the amount of $5,200. Since my “Purchase Order Sheet” had not yet been signed by the dealer rep, the check wasn’t cashed before notification, &amp; the combine wasn’t picked up, the [inconvenience] should have been slight.</p>
<p class="bqsi">Feel free to consult my attorney, John D. Coonrod, for details. Again, excuse these changes of events.</p>
<p class="bqs">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="bqs">Carl W. Krusa</p>
<p class="bqs">(FOR “K” FARMS)</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant testified that Jim Beard visited defendant at his farm around lunchtime on December 27, 1985. During this visit, Jim told defendant, “There’s no problem, Carl, just please send a check to Tony Thomas for his time explaining the differences between models and options.” Defendant recalled that their conversation was friendly and that Jim told him something to the effect that, “Carl, we maybe lost a little bit of commission on this, but don’t worry about it. I’ll make it up on the next sales.” Defendant signed the contract with Cox later that afternoon.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant testified that when he spoke with Hess on the evening of December 26, Hess did not indicate that he had signed the order that had been signed earlier <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page673" class="pagebreak">673</span>by defendant. Defendant testified that in his letter to plaintiff, he enclosed a check for $100 made payable to Thomas for Thomas’ time. Defendant believed that once this sum was paid, he was released from any obligation to plaintiff seller.</p>
<p class="indent">Jim Beard testified that in fall 1985, he approached defendant several times about purchasing a new combine. Jim testified that he again spoke with defendant about purchasing a new combine at plaintiff’s Arenzville office at 3:30 or 4 p.m. on December 23, 1985. Gerry Beard was also present. Jim stated that he did not have the authority to sell the combine at a given price; only Gerry and Hess had that authority. The price quoted by Gerry to defendant was $52,800 and the trade-in of defendant’s existing combine. Jim identified the purchase order bearing defendant’s signature. Jim filled in all the other information on that order.</p>
<p class="indent">Jim testified that defendant did not make any statements that he was going to consider the purchase further after signing the purchase order. Jim also stated that defendant did not make any statements to the effect that the purchase order was not to be considered a completed contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Jim identified the counter check payable to plaintiff for $5,200. He stated that he filled out the check and defendant signed it, but that he forgot to fill in the date on the check. Jim did not recall any statement made by defendant that the check should be held. Jim recalled that the purchase order and check were signed at approximately 5:30 p.m. He stated that defendant was not threatened or told that he could not leave the office until he signed the order. Jim stated that he would not have signed the order if defendant had said anything about reserving the right to call back later and cancel the deal.</p>
<p class="indent">Jim next spoke with defendant on December 27, 1985. Hess told Jim that defendant did not want to buy the combine and asked Jim to visit defendant. Jim met with defendant that same day and asked defendant why he could not buy the combine. Defendant told him that he could not afford it. Jim stated that defendant did not mention that he had purchased a combine from someone else.</p>
<p class="indent">On cross-examination, Jim admitted that he did not sign the purchase order which defendant had signed. He testified that Gerry and Hess are authorized to accept offers on behalf of plaintiff, but that neither one signed the order.</p>
<p class="indent">Gerry Beard testified that defendant came to plaintiff’s office in the afternoon of December 23. Gerry stated that he attempted to persuade defendant to purchase a new combine. Gerry testified that he offered to sell the new combine to defendant for $52,800 and that defendant replied, “I’ll take the deal.” Defendant then signed the order and counter check and left plaintiff’s offices.</p>
<p class="indent">Gerry stated that he is authorized to accept contracts on behalf of plaintiff. He testified that he accepted the contract with defendant. Gerry stated that defendant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page674" class="pagebreak">674</span>did not indicate, after signing the counter check and purchase order, that the transaction was not a completed deal.</p>
<p class="indent">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that a contract existed between him and plaintiff for the purchase of a combine. Defendant argues plaintiff never accepted defendant’s offer to purchase the combine because the purchase order defendant signed required a signature by a “dealer” on behalf of plaintiff for acceptance and none of plaintiff’s representatives ever signed that order. Accordingly, defendant’s subsequent refusal to “go through with the deal” constituted a valid revocation of his offer.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff argues that a contract existed between the parties even before their agreement was reduced to writing. Essentially, plaintiff contends that after the verbal agreement was reached, the terms of that agreement were memorialized on the purchase order, which was then signed by defendant. Further, plaintiff argues that this verbal agreement was evidenced by a counter check, which was also signed by defendant and which represented a down payment on the combine. Plaintiff asserts that it accepted both the purchase order and the down payment by placing those documents in its office.</p>
<p class="indent">In deciding whether the offer in the present case has been accepted, this court must first identify both the offeror and the offer. A treatise on contract law provides some guidance on this issue: “A problem arises when A, through a salesman, has frequently solicited orders from B, the contract to arise when approved by A at A’s home office. As we have seen in this situation, B is the offeror and A the offeree.” J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts § 2–18 (3d ed. 1987).</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Foremost Pro Color. v. Eastman Kodak</span> the court considered whether a contract existed based on two unsigned purchase orders. The district court had concluded that no contract existed because the purchase orders were merely offers to buy, inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by prompt or current shipment. The court of appeals agreed and stated that the weight of authority suggests that purchase orders are not enforceable contracts until accepted by the offeree.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the purchase order form signed by defendant constitutes an offer made by defendant to plaintiff. Thus, this court needs to determine whether defendant’s offer was accepted by plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 2–206 of the Uniform Commercial Code—Sales (Code) states the following:</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances</p>
<p class="list_alpha1">(a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances;</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page675" class="pagebreak">675</div>
<p class="list_alpha1">(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods, but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the purposes of the present case, the key word in this statute is the term “unambiguously.” If defendant’s offer contained on the purchase order is unambiguous in inviting acceptance only by the signature of plaintiff’s “dealer,” no contract exists until the purchase order is signed accordingly. If, however, defendant’s offer is ambiguous in inviting plaintiff’s acceptance, a contract between plaintiff and defendant could be found to exist.</p>
<p class="indent">On appeal, defendant has cited several cases supporting the argument that the purchase order he signed unambiguously invites acceptance only by signature of plaintiff’s “dealer.” One such case is <span class="italic">Brophy v. City of Joliet</span> (Ill. App. 1957) which involved the sale of revenue bonds. In that case, the court stated that where an offer requires an acceptance to be made in writing, no other form of acceptance can be made. The offer in <span class="italic">Brophy</span> read as follows:</p>
<p class="bqsi">The signed acceptance of this proposal shall constitute a contract between the undersigned and the city * * *. * * *</p>
<p class="bqsi">[] Accepted for and on behalf of * * *, which is hereby acknowledged by the duly, qualified officials.</p>
<p class="bqsi">[ ] _______</p>
<p class="bqs">Mayor</p>
<p class="bqsi">[ ] _______</p>
<p class="bqs">City Clerk</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">La Salle National Bank v. Vega</span> the court dealt with a real estate sales document which was signed by the seller as offeror and clearly stated that a contract would be in full force upon execution by the purchasing trust. The court held that the document did not constitute a valid contract in the absence of acceptance by the written execution of the purchasing trust. The court noted that an offeror has complete control over his offer and its terms of acceptance, and no other mode may be used where a written acceptance is required.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Zinni v. Royal Lincoln–Mercury, Inc.</span>, the court wrote the following:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Although the modes of a valid acceptance may be varied, the requirement of an acceptance by the offeror still exists. * * * Where an order form, containing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page676" class="pagebreak">676</span>the buyer’s offer, requires the acceptance of the seller, no contract will exist until the seller has manifested acceptance of the offer. The record before us contains no manifestation of the defendant’s acceptance of the plaintiff’s offer. Although the order form contains a space for the defendant’s signature, defendant did not sign it. While we believe defendant’s acceptance may be manifested in ways other than its signature, plaintiff’s complaint fails to allege an alternative manifestation of defendant’s acceptance. Absent an acceptance by the defendant, no contract existed between the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Southwestern Stationery &amp; Bank Supply, Inc. v. Harris Corp.</span>, the court held that the seller’s purchase order, which provided that the order was “‘subject to acceptance by Seller’” and that “‘Seller shall mail to Purchaser a signed duplicate copy hereof, and the same shall constitute the entire contract between the parties,’” unambiguously specified the proper method of acceptance. Therefore, in absence of a written acceptance by the seller, there was no contract for the sale of a printing press. The face of that purchase order stated the following:</p>
<p class="bqs">This order is hereby accepted and dated at Seller’s Cleveland, Ohio, Office on ___________</p>
<p class="bqs">HARRIS CORPORATION, a Delaware Corporation Sheet Fed Press Division, Seller</p>
<p class="bqs">By ___________</p>
<p class="indent">A case most like the present one is <span class="italic">Antonucci v. Stevens Dodge, Inc.</span> where the Civil Court of the City of New York wrote:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">When the offeror extends a promise and asks for a promise in return, and where the offeree accepts the offer by making the requested promise, the agreement is called a bilateral contract. Where the agreement takes the form of a written instrument, the acceptance is effective only when the document has been signed and delivered, unless it was clearly the intention of the parties that the earlier verbal agreement be binding and that the writing act merely as a memorandum or better evidence of the oral contract.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The printed form agreement before the Court was drafted by the defendant and contains the following clause: “This order cancels and supersedes any prior agreement and as of the date hereof comprises the entire agreement relating to the subject matters covered hereby * * *.” It is clear that the defendant, the offeree, intended that this form agreement be deemed to be the entire contract and any verbal agreements, if contrary to the terms of the written agreement, not be binding.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In the bottom lefthand corner of the agreement there is printed in large underlined type: “* * * THIS ORDER SHALL NOT BECOME BINDING UNTIL ACCEPTED BY DEALER OR HIS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE.” * * * At the bottom of the paragraph containing this sentence is a blank <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page677" class="pagebreak">677</span>line under which is printed “purchaser’s signature.” Plaintiff signed on this line. Below this is a blank line which has printed before it “Accepted By.” Under this line is printed “Dealer or his Authorized Representative.” This line bears no signature.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">On the back of the agreement are printed ten conditions. * * * Paragraph 10 states: “This order is subject to acceptance by the dealer, which acceptance shall be signified by the signature of Dealer, Dealer’s Manager or other authorized signature on the reverse side hereof.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It is obvious that the parties intended the agreement to be bilateral and that the offer by the plaintiff to purchase the pickup be deemed accepted by the defendant only when he or his authorized representative signed the order.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The presenting of the order by the dealer was an invitation to the plaintiff to make an offer to purchase the pickup truck. The signing of the order by the plaintiff constituted an offer by him to purchase the truck. By the printed terms of the agreement only the signature of the defendant or its authorized representatives would constitute acceptance of the plaintiff’s offer and thus create a binding bilateral contract. In a bilateral contract it is essential that the fact of acceptance be communicated to the offeror. The failure of the defendant or his representative to sign the order is conclusive proof that the defendant did not accept the offer. It was the defendant who drafted the agreement and set forth the manner in which it would accept an offer. The fact that defendant ordered and accepted delivery of a pickup truck does not constitute acceptance under the terms of the agreement. By the terms of the agreement only the signature of the defendant could constitute acceptance. The plaintiff’s refusal to accept the truck constituted a valid revocation of his offer. As a general rule, an offer may be revoked or withdrawn at any time before it is accepted with certain exceptions set forth in the Uniform Commercial Code. This case does not fall within any of the code exceptions.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The Court finds by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that an enforceable bilateral contract was not formed because of defendant’s failure to accept plaintiff’s offer and that plaintiff validly revoked his offer.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff counters defendant’s argument by contending that plaintiff was the one to offer the combine to defendant and defendant accepted plaintiff’s offer by signing a counter check and giving that check to plaintiff as a down payment on the combine. We are unpersuaded.</p>
<p class="indent">We construe section 2–206 of the Code as giving approval to an ancient and cardinal rule of the law of contracts: the offeror is the master of his offer. An offeror may prescribe as many conditions or terms of the method of acceptance as he may wish, including, but not limited to, the time, place, and manner. We also note that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page678" class="pagebreak">678</span>contracts are generally construed against the party who drafted the document (<span class="italic">see</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206) and that plaintiff drafted the purchase order in the present case, and then gave it to defendant to use for his offer to purchase the combine.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the purchase order in this case “unambiguously” required the signature by plaintiff’s “dealer” in order to be a proper acceptance of defendant’s offer. Because plaintiff’s “dealer” never signed the purchase order, no contract ever existed.</p>
<p class="indent">For the reasons stated, the judgment in favor of plaintiff is reversed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Was a writing necessary to form a contract in this case? See the UCC § 2–201. Even if § 2–201 does require a writing as a predicate to contract enforcement, isn’t it possible to have an oral contract subject to a later written confirmation under the UCC? Note that the Statute of Frauds requires only that the party to be charged sign the writing. Why is the plaintiff dealer required to sign the purchase order in this case? It is its form, and presumably it filled in all the blanks. Shouldn’t the defendant buyer’s signature suffice?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. How can the UCC at once treat the Hills’ failure to return the computer as a valid acceptance of the unsigned, unread, and unknown arbitration clause, but not Beard Implement’s conduct in accepting Mr. Krusa’s $5,200 check as a deposit against a fully negotiated purchase order?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. What is all this business about the customer being liable for the salesman’s time if the customer decides not to buy? What happened to the check Krusa gave the salesman here? If Beard accepted it, was it an accord and satisfaction barring this suit?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The court in this opinion recounts the testimony extensively, mentioning many details of each side’s version of what happened. Do the two versions differ materially? Do the differences matter for the court’s analysis of the case?</p>

<p class="indent">If acceptance binds the offeror by delivering to him the requested exchange, what if the terms of the acceptance purport to vary the offer in some way? In the real world, commercial agreements are not the product of discrete and distinctly defined offers and acceptances, but more often emerge in the course of an ongoing relationship made up of an open-ended number of communications between the parties.</p>

<p id="sec333" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">United States v. Braunstein</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States District Court, S.D. New York, 1947.</p>
<p class="sectionb">75 F.Supp. 137.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>EDINA</small>, D.J. The United States has brought suit for breach of a contract whereby defendants, it is said, agreed to buy from it 9599 twenty-five pound boxes of raisins unfit for human consumption which could be converted into alcohol. The parties have stipulated that an interchange of telegrams, hereinafter referred to, constitutes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page681" class="pagebreak">681</span>the contract, if there was one, that furnishes the foundation for the suit. Defendant Sidney Braunstein asserts this interchange of telegrams did not create a contract, and moves for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">On July 21, 1945 the Commodity Credit Corporation, an instrumentality of the United States, issued Announcement AWS–11 which invited bids for the purchase of the off-condition raisins in question and laid down requirements to which all bids must conform. Thus, all bids were required to state that they were subject to the terms and conditions of that announcement and to designate what bonded distillery the raisins would be shipped to, should the bidder be successful. The announcement also required that the raisins be paid for by check within ten days from the date of the telegram accepting the bid.</p>
<p class="indent">The interchange of telegrams began on August 3, 1945, when the defendant Pearl Distilling Co. sent the following telegram to David Ludlum of the Washington office of the Commodity Credit Corporation:</p>
<p class="bqsi">David Ludlum, Contracting and Adjustment Div. Sales Branch Office of Supply</p>
<p class="bqs">US Dep of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="bqsi">Offer ten cents per pound for 9599 boxes of raisins located Cleveland Ohio</p>
<p class="bqs">Pearl Distilling Co.</p>
<p class="indent">This telegram lacked the required reference to Announcement AWS–11 and did not designate the distillery for shipment. On receiving the telegram, David Ludlum telegraphed the Pearl Distilling Co. referring to Announcement AWS–11 and asking for shipping information. Pearl Distilling Co. supplied this information by a telegram of August 7, 1945 and inquired about shipping costs.</p>
<p class="indent">The Commodity Credit Corporation’s telegram of August 9, 1945 is the crux of this whole interchange. It reads:</p>
<p class="bqs">Pearl Distilling Company<br />377–91 East 163rd Street<br />New York, New York</p>
<p class="bqsi">Subject terms announcement AWS 11 CCC accepts your August 3 offer to purchase and August 7 wire giving shipping instructions for 9599 boxes raisins at 10 cents per box plus freight and 3 per cent tax from Cleveland, Ohio to New Brunswick, New Jersey, at 45 cents per cwt.</p>
<p class="bqsi">Forward certified check in the amount of $2,138.92. Contract AW–S(F) 31752 Commodity Credit Corporation David S. Ludlum</p>
<p class="indent">Pearl Distilling Co. had offered ten cents a pound. The telegram of August 9th specified a price of ten cents a box. The total price of $2,138.92 appears to have been calculated on the basis of ten cents a box, although the method of calculation is not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page682" class="pagebreak">682</span>entirely clear. Since a box contained twenty-five pounds, the price was off by something like twenty-three thousand dollars. It was the Commodity Credit Corporation’s intention to accept the offer of ten cents a pound, but one of its employees had made a mistake in preparing the telegram of August 9th and in calculating the price.</p>
<p class="indent">When the defendants received this telegram, they did nothing and no check was sent to the Commodity Credit Corporation. Ten days later, when the time for receipt of the check had expired, the Commodity Credit Corporation looked into the matter, discovered its error, and sent this telegram:</p>
<p class="bqs">Aug 20 PM 4:28<br />Pearl Distilling Co<br />377–91 East 163 St</p>
<p class="bqsi">Reourtel August 9 contract AW–S (F)–31752 covering sale of raisins should read at 10 cents per pound instead of 10 cents per box also certified check should be in the amount of $25,176.52 instead of $2,138.92 Please confirm</p>
<p class="bqs">David S. Ludlum<br />Commodity Credit Corporation</p>
<p class="indent">Again the defendants did nothing, and so matters stood for two months. The raisins, of course, had not been shipped to the defendants. Then, on October 19, 1945, the Commodity Credit Corporation notified the defendants that if they failed to pay for the raisins by October 25, the raisins would be sold and the defendants held for any loss. The defendants did not pay, the raisins were sold at a loss, and the United States brought suit for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a contract if the telegram of August 9 was an acceptance of the offer of August 3. If there can be an issue of fact as to whether that telegram of August 9 was an acceptance, this motion for summary judgment must be denied. To put it another way, does the mistaken substitution of “ten cents per box” for “ten cents per pound” coupled with a calculation of the total price based on the wrong figure defeat, as a matter of law, what was intended as an acceptance?</p>
<p class="indent">The basic principles of law involved here are simple. To create a contract, an acceptance must be “unequivocal,” Restatement, Contracts § 58 (1932), “positive and unambiguous,” 1 Williston, Contracts § 72 Rev.Ed.1936, and “must comply exactly with the requirements of the offer.” Restatement, Contracts § 59 (1932). A reply to an offer that fails to comply with these requirements is a rejection.</p>
<p class="indent">Certainly no reasonable man could say that on its face the telegram of August 9 met these requirements. The mention of a price foreign to the negotiation renders the effect of the telegram uncertain and ambiguous. Furthermore, the mere use of the word “accept” does not automatically make a communication an acceptance.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page683" class="pagebreak">683</div>
<p class="indent">The government, however, insists that the defendants knew perfectly well what the telegram of August 9 meant; that, in spite of a clerical error, it was an acceptance; for no reasonable man could think that the government was in effect rejecting an offer of ten cents a pound and making what amounted to a counter-offer of ten cents for a twenty-five pound box. The argument comes to this: that a reasonable man would disregard the error and see behind to the intention that, but for a surface obscurity, was perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="indent">There is limited merit to this contention. The law would not allow the defendants to treat the telegram of August 9 as a counter-offer which their acceptance could turn into a contract seriously disadvantageous to the government, since there was obviously something dubious about it. “An offeree may not snap up an offer that is on its face too good to be true.” 1 Williston, Contracts § 94, Rev.Ed.1936. It is a justifiable conclusion that the defendants did not think the telegram was a counter-offer, but that they knew the Commodity Credit Corporation’s intention varied from what the words of the telegram expressed. This conclusion, however, does not help the government. “If either party knows that the other does not intend what his words or other acts express, this knowledge prevents such words or other acts from being operative as an offer or acceptance.” Restatement, Contracts § 71(c) (1932).</p>
<p class="indent">The government next urges that the court may interpret the telegrams in the interest of justice so as to make a contract out of them, citing 3 Williston, Contracts §§ 603, 605, 616, 618–620, 628, 629, Rev.Ed.1936. There it is shown that courts have disregarded clerical errors or particular words, and have supplied and interposed words in their attempt to give writings a construction which would not render them void or meaningless. This court is urged to interpret the telegram of August 9 into an acceptance on the basis of such authority.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that there is much room for interpretation once the parties are inside the framework of a contract, but it seems that there is less in the field of offer and acceptance. Greater precision of expression may be required, and less help from the court given, when the parties are merely at the threshold of a contract. If a court should undertake to resolve ambiguities in the negotiations between parties, disregard clerical errors, and rearrange words, leaving out some and putting in others, it is hard to see where the line of demarcation could be drawn and the general effect would inevitably be a condition of chaos and uncertainty.</p>
<p class="indent">But the courts have refrained from reforming offers and acceptances. Thus, in the classic case of <span class="italic">Harvey v. Facey</span>, [1893] A.C. 552 (P.C.), it would have taken but little interpretation to construe as an offer the defendant’s telegram, “Lowest price for Bumper Hall Pen £900,” which was a reply to plaintiff’s telegram, “Will you sell us Bumper Hall Pen? Telegraph lowest cash price.” But the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled otherwise.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page684" class="pagebreak">684</div>
<p class="indent">In 1 Williston, Contracts § 72, Rev.Ed.1936, are cited several examples of communications held to be insufficient as acceptances. They too would have needed but slight interpretation to come up to the legal standard, but again the courts were reluctant to interpret parties into a contractual status. Indeed, this very reluctance may have been one of the causes for the development of the doctrine of quasi-contract. And it seems significant that the fictions indulged in that branch of the law were made only in instances of clearly defined unjust enrichment. There is nothing of that kind here.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be rigorous to disregard a purported acceptance because of a clerical error, but if there is any fault, it lies with the Commodity Credit Corporation. “Since one who speaks or writes, can, by exactness of expression, more easily prevent mistakes in meaning, than one with whom he is dealing, doubts arising from ambiguity of language are resolved against the former in favor of the latter.” Restatement, Contracts § 236, comment <span class="italic">d</span> (1932).</p>
<p class="indent">A decision for defendants will not interfere with commercial dealings by requiring formality in offer and acceptance. It will merely mean that if a purported acceptance repeats the terms of the offer, the acceptor takes the risk of his own clerical error in repetition.</p>
<p class="indent">The government made a point in passing, without pressing it, that the telegram of August 3 in which the Commodity Credit Corporation asked the defendants for shipping instructions was itself an acceptance, since only the successful bidder would be asked for these instructions. This telegram, however, was insufficiently unequivocal to be an acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">At the request of the government, and to avoid any possible misconception of the attendant facts and circumstances, an opportunity was afforded for the filing of supplemental affidavits, which were finally forthcoming. They add nothing of any relevance to the sole issue of offer and acceptance, which by the stipulation of the parties depends upon the telegrams above referred to.</p>
<p class="indent">Motion granted. Complaint dismissed.</p>
<p id="sec334" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. In the fall of 1945 commodity prices were subject to wartime price controls, and the wholesale price ceiling on several varieties of <span class="bold"><span class="italic">edible</span></span> raisins in 25–pound boxes was as low as 8 cents per pound. Does this perhaps explain why the government clerk made his mistake? Did Braunstein make the original mistake by promising too high a price for inedible raisins? Or was Braunstein’s only mistake not anticipating the imminent end of World War II?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page685" class="pagebreak">685</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If the government’s telegram was not a rejection, a counteroffer, or an acceptance, what was it?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The government appealed the above decision. The Second Circuit dismissed its appeal. Although the dismissal was based on the jurisdictional technicality that the judgment appealed from was not final since it did not dispose of all claims against all of the defendants, Judge Augustus Hand closed his opinion with these words:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">We may add, though it is by way of dictum since the appeal is not properly before us, that the district judge’s disposition of the merits as between the plaintiff and Braunstein seems to us correct and we should have disposed of the case on his opinion had we not felt it necessary to raise the question of the finality of the judgment for purposes of appeal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Suppose the government had refused to deliver and Braunstein sued the government. Would the court have found a contract, and, if so, what would be its terms? Would the result in such a suit depend on whether Braunstein tendered the government the contract price? How much would he have to tender?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Suppose the error in this case wasn’t over the price term, but rather that one telegram provided that arbitration was to occur within ten days of any dispute, while the reply telegram provided that arbitration was to occur within ten months of any dispute. Still no contract?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. At some point wasn’t Braunstein bound to reply to the government or be bound to the government’s revised price term in its August 20 telegram by his silence?</p>

<p class="list_alpha">(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page686" class="pagebreak">686</div>
<p class="list_alpha1">(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;</p>
<p class="list_alpha1">(b) they materially alter it; or (c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Section 2–207 has three distinct subparts that serve somewhat different functions. Subsection 1 deals with the problem discussed in <span class="italic">Braunstein</span>, whether the terms of an acceptance must perfectly match the offer in order to create a contract. This subsection takes the position that generally an acceptance is operative even if it states different or additional terms. Subsection 2 tries to deal with the content of a contract formed by offer and acceptance that do not match. Between non-merchants additional terms become proposals for modification of the contract, but between merchants they become part of the contract unless there is some objection by the other side or they materially alter the contract. Subsection 3 provides that even if the writings exchanged by the parties do not establish a contract, one may be found from their conduct, if they behaved as if a contract existed. In such a case, the content of the contract is the terms on which the parties’ writings agree plus the general rules provided by the UCC.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain textual anomalies in § 2–207 compound the confusion arising from its complex structure. Subsection 1 talks about “additional or different” terms, while Subsection 2 talks only about “additional terms.” Is this a slip of the pen, or does it suggest a substantive difference? Most (but not all) courts considering this have concluded that Subsection 2 applies to both additional and different terms. As the following case indicates, the most vexing question is what kinds of additional or different terms <span class="bold"><span class="italic">materially</span></span> alter the contract. Most of the cases that have arisen involve a few situation types. The two most common are clauses that limit warranty liability for defective products and those that limit or provide special remedies, such as limitations of consequential damages or an arbitration clause. Consider the treatment of this issue in the CISG, which does not go as far as § 2–207(1) in finding a contract on the basis of nonmatching documents so long as the parties agree in fact, but provides clearer guidance on what provisions materially alter the deal.</p>

<p class="noindentt">■ P<small>OSNER</small>, C.J.</p>
<p class="indent">“Battle of the forms” refers to the not uncommon situation in which one business firm makes an offer in the form of a preprinted form contract and the offeree responds with its own form contract. At common law, any discrepancy between the forms would prevent the offeree’s response from operating as an acceptance. So there would be no contract in such a case. This was the “mirror image” rule, which Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code jettisoned by providing that “a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.” UCC § 2-207(1). Mischief lurks in the words “additional to or different from.” The next subsection of 2-207 provides that if additional terms in the acceptance are not materially different from those in the offer, then, subject to certain other qualifications (<span class="italic">id.</span> at 1335-37), they become part of the contract, § 2-207(2), while if the additional terms are materially different they operate as proposals and so have no effect unless the offeror agrees to them, UCC § 2-207, comment 3; if the offeror does not agree to them, therefore, the terms of the contract are those in the offer. A clause providing for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page689" class="pagebreak">689</span>interest at normal rates on overdue invoices, or limiting the right to reject goods because of defects falling within customary trade tolerances for acceptance with adjustment, would be the sort of additional term that is not deemed material, and hence it would become a part of the contract even if the offeror never signified acceptance of it. <span class="italic">Id.,</span> comment 5.</p>
<p class="indent">The Code does not explain, however, what happens if the offeree’s response contains <span class="italic">different</span> terms (rather than additional ones) within the meaning of section 2-207(1). There is no consensus on that question. See James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, <span class="italic">Uniform Commercial Code</span> 33-36 (3d ed. 1988); John E. Murray, Jr., “The Chaos of the ‘Battle of the Forms’: Solutions,” 39 <span class="italic">Vand.L.Rev.</span> 1307, 1354-65 (1986). We know there is a contract because an acceptance is effective even though it contains different terms; but what are the terms of the contract that is brought into being by the offer and acceptance? One view is that the discrepant terms in both the nonidentical offer and the acceptance drop out, and default terms found elsewhere in the Code fill the resulting gap. Another view is that the offeree’s discrepant terms drop out and the offeror’s become part of the contract. A third view, possibly the most sensible, equates “different” with “additional” and makes the outcome turn on whether the new terms in the acceptance are materially different from the terms in the offer in which event they operate as proposals, so that the offeror’s terms prevail unless he agrees to the variant terms in the acceptance or not materially different from the terms in the offer, in which event they become part of the contract. John L. Utz, “More on the Battle of the Forms: The Treatment of ‘Different’ Terms Under the Uniform Commercial Code,” 16 <span class="italic">U.C.C.L.J.</span> 103 (1983). This interpretation equating “different” to “additional,” bolstered by drafting history which shows that the omission of “or different” from section 2-207(2) was a drafting error, substitutes a manageable inquiry into materiality, for a hair-splitting inquiry into the difference between “different” and “additional.” It is hair-splitting (“metaphysical,” “casuistic,” “semantic,” in the pejorative senses of these words) because all different terms are additional and all additional terms are different.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, the Illinois courts whose understanding of Article 2 of the UCC is binding on us because this is a diversity suit governed, all agree, by Illinois law have had no occasion to choose among the different positions on the consequences of an acceptance that contains “different” terms from the offer. We shall have to choose.</p>
<p class="indent">The battle of the forms in this case takes the form of something very like a badminton game, but we can simplify it a bit without distorting the issues. The players are Northrop, the giant defense firm, and Litronic, which manufactures electronic components, including “printed wire boards” that are incorporated into defense weapon systems. In 1987 Northrop sent several manufacturers, including Litronic, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page690" class="pagebreak">690</span>a request to submit offers to sell Northrop a customized printed wire board designated by Northrop as a “1714 Board.” The request stated that any purchase would be made by means of a purchase order that would set forth terms and conditions that would override any inconsistent terms in the offer. In response, Litronic mailed an offer to sell Northrop four boards for $19,000 apiece, to be delivered within six weeks. The offer contained a 90-day warranty stated to be in lieu of any other warranties, and provided that the terms of the offer would take precedence over any terms proposed by the buyer. Lynch, a purchasing officer of Northrop, responded to the offer in a phone conversation in which he told Litronic’s man, Lair, that he was accepting the offer up to the limit of his authority, which was $24,999, and that a formal purchase order for all four boards would follow. Litronic was familiar with Northrop’s purchase order form, having previously done business with Northrop, which had been using the same form for some time. Had Lair referred to any of the previous orders, he would have discovered that Northrop’s order form provided for a warranty that contained no time limit.</p>
<p class="indent">Lynch followed up the phone conversation a month later with a “turn on” letter, authorizing Litronic to begin production of all four boards (it had done so already) and repeating that a purchase order would follow. The record is unclear when the actual purchase order was mailed; it may have been as much as four months after the phone conversation and three months after the turn-on letter. The purchase order required the seller to send a written acknowledgment to Northrop. Litronic never did so, however, and Northrop did not complain; it does not bother to follow up on its requirement of a signed acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Litronic had begun manufacturing the boards immediately after the telephone call from Lynch, for reasons that are unknown but that Northrop does not contend are culpable Litronic did not deliver the first three boards until more than a year later, in July of 1988. Northrop tested the boards for conformity to its specifications. The testing was protracted, either because the boards were highly complex or because Northrop’s inspectors were busy, or perhaps for both reasons. At all events it was not until December and January, five or six months after delivery, that Northrop returned the three boards (the fourth had not been delivered), claiming that they were defective. Litronic refused to accept the return of the boards, on the ground that its 90-day warranty had lapsed. Northrop’s position of course is that it had an unlimited warranty, as stated in the purchase order.</p>
<p class="indent">As an original matter one might suppose that this dispute is not over the terms of the warranty but over whether Northrop waited more than the “reasonable time” that the Uniform Commercial Code allows the buyer of nonconforming goods to reject them. UCC § 2-602(1). That in fact is how the magistrate judge framed the issue, as we shall see. But the parties continue to treat it as a “warranty” case. Their implicit view is that Litronic’s 90-day warranty, if a term of the contract, not only <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page691" class="pagebreak">691</span>barred Northrop from complaining about defects that showed up more than 90 days after the delivery of the boards but also limited to 90 days the time within which Northrop was permitted to reject the boards because of defects that rendered them nonconforming. We accept this view for purposes of deciding these appeals. …</p>
<p class="indent">Litronic’s appeal concerns the breach of its warranty on the No. 1714 boards. It wins if the warranty really did expire after only 90 days. The parties agree that Litronic’s offer to sell the No. 1714 boards to Northrop, the offer made in response to Northrop’s request for bids, was the offer. So far, so good. If Northrop’s Mr. Lynch accepted the offer over the phone, the parties had a contract then and there, but the question would still be on what terms. Regarding the first question, whether there was a contract, we may assume to begin with that the acceptance was sufficiently “definite” to satisfy the requirement of definiteness in section 2-207(1); after all, it impelled Litronic to begin production immediately, and there is no suggestion that it acted precipitately in doing so. We do not know whether Lynch in his conversation with Lair made acceptance of the complete contract expressly conditional on approval by Lynch’s superiors at Northrop. We know that he had authority to contract only up to $24,999, but we do not know whether he told Lair what the exact limitation on his authority was or whether Litronic knew it without being told. It does not matter. The condition, if it was a condition, was satisfied and so drops out.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not think that Northrop’s acceptance, via Lynch, of Litronic’s offer could be thought conditional on Litronic’s yielding to Northrop’s demand for an open-ended warranty. For while Lynch’s reference to the purchase order might have alerted Litronic to Northrop’s desire for a warranty not limited to 90 days, Lynch did not purport to make the more extensive warranty a condition of acceptance. So the condition, if there was one, was not an express condition, as the cases insist it be.</p>
<p class="indent">There was a contract, therefore; further, and, as we shall note, decisive, evidence being that the parties acted as if they had a contract—the boards were shipped and paid for. The question is then what the terms of the warranty in the contract were. Lynch’s reference in the phone conversation to the forthcoming purchase order shows that Northrop’s acceptance contained different terms from the offer, namely the discrepant terms in the purchase order, in particular the warranty—for it is plain that the Northrop warranty was intended to be indefinite in length, so that, at least in the absence of some industry custom setting a limit on warranties that do not specify a duration (cf. UCC § 2-207, comments 4 and 5), a point not raised, any limitation on the length of the warranty in the offer would be a materially different term. Of course the fact that Northrop preferred a longer warranty than Litronic was offering does not by itself establish that Northrop’s acceptance contained different terms. But Lynch did not accept Litronic’s offer and leave it at that. He said that he would issue a Northrop purchase order, and both he and Lair knew (or at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page692" class="pagebreak">692</span>least should have known) that the Northrop purchase order form contained a different warranty from Litronic’s sale order form. And we have already said that Lynch did not, by his oral reference to the purchase order, condition Northrop’s purchase on Litronic’s agreeing to comply with all the terms in the purchase order form, given the courts’ insistence that any such condition be explicit. (Judges are skeptical that even businesspeople read boilerplate, so they are reluctant, rightly or wrongly, to make a contract fail on the basis of a printed condition in a form contract.) But Lynch said enough to make clear to Lair that the acceptance contained different terms from the offer.</p>
<p class="indent">The Uniform Commercial Code, as we have said, does not say what the terms of the contract are if the offer and acceptance contain different terms, as distinct from cases in which the acceptance merely contains additional terms to those in the offer. The majority view is that the discrepant terms fall out and are replaced by a suitable UCC gap-filler. The magistrate judge followed this approach and proceeded to section 2-309, which provides that nonconforming goods may be rejected within a “reasonable” time (see also § 2-601(1)), and she held that the six months that Northrop took to reject Litronic’s boards was a reasonable time because of the complexity of the required testing. The leading minority view is that the discrepant terms <span class="italic">in the acceptance</span> are to be ignored, and that would give the palm to Litronic. Our own preferred view—the view that assimilates “different” to “additional,” so that the terms in the offer prevail over the different terms in the acceptance only if the latter are materially different, has as yet been adopted by only one state, California. Under that view, as under what we are calling the “leading” minority view, the warranty in Litronic’s offer, the 90-day warranty, was the contractual warranty, because the unlimited warranty contained in Northrop’s acceptance was materially different.</p>
<p class="indent">Because Illinois in other UCC cases has tended to adopt majority rules, and because the interest in the uniform nationwide application of the Code—an interest asserted in the Code itself (see § [1-103])—argues for nudging majority views, even if imperfect (but not downright bad), toward unanimity, we start with a presumption that Illinois, whose position we are trying to predict, would adopt the majority view. We do not find the presumption rebutted. The idea behind the majority view is that the presence of different terms in the acceptance suggests that the offeree didn’t <span class="italic">really</span> accede to the offeror’s terms, yet both parties wanted to contract, so why not find a neutral term to govern the dispute that has arisen between them? Of course the offeree may not have had any serious objection to the terms in the offer at the time of contracting; he may have mailed a boilerplated form without giving any thought to its contents or to its suitability for the particular contract in question. But it is just as likely that the discrepant terms <span class="italic">in the offer</span> itself were the product of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page693" class="pagebreak">693</span>thoughtless use of a boilerplate form rather than a considered condition of contracting. And if the offeror doesn’t want to do business other than on the terms in the offer, he can protect himself by specifying that the offeree must accept all those terms for the parties to have a contract. UCC § 2-207(2)(a). Now as it happens Litronic did state in its offer that the terms in the offer “take precedence over terms and conditions of the buyer, unless specifically negotiated otherwise.” But, for reasons that we do not and need not fathom, Litronic does not argue that this language conditioned the existence of the contract on Northrop’s acceding to the 90-day warranty in the offer; any such argument is therefore waived.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that the offeree likewise can protect himself by making his acceptance of the offer conditional on the offeror’s acceding to any different terms in the acceptance. But so many acceptances are made over the phone by relatively junior employees, as in this case, that it may be unrealistic to expect offerees to protect themselves in this way. The offeror goes first and therefore has a little more time for careful specification of the terms on which he is willing to make a contract. What we are calling the leading minority view may tempt the offeror to spring a surprise on the offeree, hoping the latter won’t read the fine print. Under the majority view, if the offeree tries to spring a surprise (the offeror can’t, since his terms won’t prevail if the acceptance contains different terms), the parties move to neutral ground; and the offeror can, we have suggested, more easily protect himself against being surprised than the offeree can protect <span class="italic">himself</span> against being surprised. The California rule dissolves all these problems, but has too little support to make it a plausible candidate for Illinois, or at least a plausible candidate for our guess as to Illinois’s position.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a further wrinkle, however. The third subsection of section 2-207 provides that even if no contract is established under either of the first two subsections, it may be established by the “conduct of the parties,” and in that event (as subsection (3) expressly provides) the discrepant terms vanish and are replaced by UCC gap fillers. This may seem to make it impossible for the offeror to protect himself from being contractually bound by specifying that the acceptance must mirror his offer. But subsection (3) comes into play only when the parties have by their conduct manifested the existence of a contract, as where the offeror, having specified that the acceptance must mirror the offer yet having received an acceptance that deviates from the offer, nonetheless goes ahead and performs as if there were a contract. That is one way to interpret what happened here but it leads to the same result as applying subsection (2) interpreted as the majority of states do, so we need not consider it separately.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the intricacy of the No. 1714 boards, it is unlikely that Northrop would have acceded to a 90-day limitation on its warranty protection. Litronic at argument <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page694" class="pagebreak">694</span>stressed that it is a much smaller firm, hence presumably unwilling to assume burdensome warranty obligations; but it is a curious suggestion that little fellows are more likely than big ones to get their way in negotiations between firms of disparate size. And Northrop actually got only half its way, though enough for victory here; for by virtue of accepting Litronic’s offer without expressly conditioning its acceptance on Litronic’s acceding to Northrop’s terms, Northrop got not a warranty unlimited in duration, as its purchase order provides, but (pursuant to the majority understanding of UCC § 2-207(2)) a warranty of “reasonable” duration, courtesy the court. If special circumstances made a 90-day warranty reasonable, Litronic was free to argue for it in the district court.</p>
<p class="indent">On the view we take, the purchase order has no significance beyond showing that Northrop’s acceptance contained (albeit by reference) different terms. The fact that Litronic never signed the order, and the fact that Northrop never called this omission to Litronic’s attention, also drop out of the case, along with Northrop’s argument that to enforce the 90-day limitation in Litronic’s warranty would be unconscionable. But for future reference we remind Northrop and companies like it that the defense of unconscionability was not invented to protect multi-billion dollar corporations against mistakes committed by their employees, and indeed has rarely succeeded outside the area of consumer contracts.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Can you reconcile this case with <span class="italic">Hill v. Gateway</span>, p. 664, also a Seventh Circuit decision? Gateway (which had never done business with the Hills before) was entitled to (i) not mention arbitration when it took the order over the phone, (ii) stick its arbitration clause in the boilerplate terms enclosed with the shipment, and (iii) hold the Hills to those unbargained-for terms based on the Hills’ retention of the goods. Litronic, on the other hand, can’t enforce its limited warranty term despite (i) sending a form to Northrop Corporation in advance of the telephone call on which Northrop committed to buy the No. 1714 boards, (ii) a provision in the Litronic form that the terms of the offer (presumably including the limited warranty) would take precedence over any terms proposed by the buyer, and (iii) Northrop’s retention of the goods. Why is Northrop Corporation being protected against unbargained-for terms buried in boilerplate forms but not the Hills? How does that result square with Chief Judge Posner’s pointed reminder to Northrop “that the defense of unconscionability was not invented to protect multi-billion dollar corporations against mistakes committed by their employees”? And if the problem is the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page695" class="pagebreak">695</span>imposition of unbargained for terms contained in unread forms, why does it matter whether there are multiple conflicting forms?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Isn’t the lesson of this case simply that you must get your counterparty to sign your form if you want to enforce your unbargained-for boilerplate terms against him? Isn’t that obvious? But, then again, why should a signature on a form that no one reads and no one is expected to read matter? Consider this passage from Lord Devlin’s opinion in <span class="italic">McCutcheon v. David MacBrayne Ltd.</span>, 1 W.L.R. 125, 132-33 (H.L. 1964):</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">My Lords, when a person in the Isle of Islay wishes to send goods to the mainland he goes into the office of MacBrayne (the respondents) in Port Askaig which is conveniently combined with the local post office. There he is presented with a document headed “conditions” containing three or four thousand words of small print divided into 27 paragraphs…. If it were possible for your Lordships to escape from the world of make-believe which the law has created into the real world in which transactions of this sort are actually done, the answer would be short and simple. It should make no difference whatever [whether the document was signed]. This sort of document is not meant to be read, still less to be understood. Its signature is in truth about as significant as a handshake that marks the formal conclusion of a bargain.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The Battle of the Forms has been a darling of legal education for two generations now, but modern contracting habits may render it of historical interest only. Written forms rarely cross nowadays. Given the pervasiveness of web-based contracting, orders do not generally become accepted until someone (generally the party with less bargaining power) clicks on an “I Accept” button on his counterparty’s website or purchasing software, and thereby in some theoretical sense “manifests assent” to all the boilerplate terms and conditions that neither party has read or thought about. This is as true in commercial purchasing as it is in consumer transactions. In a paper world it was possible to just not sign the other guy’s form <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page697" class="pagebreak">697</span>and confirm the transaction on your own form; not so, with the ubiquitous “I Accept” button if you want to actually complete the transaction. And once you click aren’t both parties bound to whatever those terms are? Sending a later form would simply be a proposal for modification that if ignored by the counterparty would fall out of the analysis. In these circumstances, the Battle of the Forms collapses into the <span class="italic">Hill v. Gateway</span>, p. 664 problem, leaving one party, generally the more vulnerable one, exposed to un-bargained-for, one-sided and unfair terms. The answer of course, as suggested in the 2003 proposed revision of 2-206 and 2-207 is to police un-bargained-for terms, rejecting those that do not conform to both parties’ reasonable expectations and replacing them with neutral standard terms drawn from the common law or Article 2. This in fact is the solution that most courts have groped towards notwithstanding the textual difficulties under existing 2-207. But the 2003 proposed revision which expressly adopted this solution was itself roundly rejected by the state legislatures, leaving only the (quite limited) unconscionability doctrine as a mechanism for policing unfair terms in the absence of applicable consumer protection legislation. Ironically, new technology and changed contracting habits leave businesses previously able to avoid assenting to unfair boilerplate terms in the past under 2-207 increasingly stuck with those terms, outside the scope of existing consumer protections, and generally in a poor position given their status as merchants to assert an unconscionability defense notwithstanding imbalances in bargaining power and substantive unfairness.

<p class="sectionb">1 Barn. &amp; Ald. 681.</p>
<p class="indent">Action for non-delivery of wool according to agreement. At the trial at the last Lent assizes for the county of Worcester, before Burrough, J., it appeared that the defendants, who were dealers in wool, at St. Ives, in the county of Huntingdon, had, on Tuesday September 2d, 1817, written the following letter to the plaintiffs, who were woolen manufacturers residing in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire: “We now offer you eight hundred tods of wether fleeces, of a good fair quality of our country wool, at 35s. 6d. per tod, to be delivered at Leicester, and to be paid for by two <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page698" class="pagebreak">698</span>months’ bill in two months, and to be weighed up by your agent within fourteen days, receiving your answer in course of post.”</p>
<p class="indent">This letter was misdirected by the defendants, to Bromsgrove, Leicestershire, in consequence of which it was not received by the plaintiffs in Worcestershire till 7 p.m. on Friday, September 5th. On that evening the plaintiffs wrote an answer, agreeing to accept the wool on the terms proposed. The course of the post between St. Ives and Bromsgrove is through London, and consequently this answer was not received by the defendants till Tuesday, September 9th. On the Monday September 8th, the defendants not having, as they expected, received an answer on Sunday September 7th, (which in case their letter had not been misdirected, would have been in the usual course of the post), sold the wool in question to another person. Under these circumstances, the learned judge held, that the delay having been occasioned by the neglect of the defendants, the jury must take it, that the answer did come back in due course of post; and that then the defendants were liable for the loss that had been sustained: and the plaintiffs accordingly recovered a verdict.</p>
<p class="indent">Jervis having in Easter Term obtained a rule <span class="italic">nisi</span> for a new trial, on the ground that there was no binding contract between the parties.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Dauncey, Puller &amp; Richardson shewed cause</span>. They contended, that at the moment of the acceptance of the offer of the defendants by the plaintiffs, the former became bound. And that was on the Friday evening, when there had been no change of circumstances. They were then stopped by the Court, who called upon</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Jervis &amp; Campbell in support of the rule</span>. They relied on <span class="italic">Payne v. Cave</span>, and more particularly on <span class="italic">Cooke v. Oxley</span>. In that case, Oxley, who had proposed to sell goods to Cooke, and given him a certain time at his request, to determine whether he would buy them or not was held not liable to the performance of the contract, even though Cooke, within the specified time, had determined to buy them, and given Oxley notice to that effect. So here the defendants who had proposed by letter to sell this wool, are not to be held liable, even though it be now admitted that the answer did come back in due course of post. Till the plaintiff’s answer was actually received, there could be no binding contract between the parties; and before then the defendants had retracted their offer by selling the wool to other persons. But</p>
<p class="indent">T<small>HE</small> C<small>OURT</small> said that if that were so, no contract could ever be completed by the post. For if the defendants were not bound by their offer when accepted by the plaintiffs till the answer was received, then the plaintiffs ought not to be bound till after they had received the notification that the defendants had received their answer and assented to it. And so it might go on <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>. The defendants must be considered in law as making, during every instant of the time their letter was traveling, the same identical offer to the plaintiffs; and then the contract is completed by the acceptance of it by the latter. Then as to the delay in notifying the acceptance, that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page699" class="pagebreak">699</span>arises entirely from the mistake of the defendants, and it therefore must be taken as against them, that the plaintiffs’ answer was received in course of post.</p>

<p id="sec346" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON MAILBOX RULE: A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE</span></p>
<p class="indent">The rule that an acceptance is effective when the offeree sends it off to the offeror has several curious aspects that deserve comment. First, it applies only to acceptances. The Restatement, Second, Contracts reflects the case law and the statutes that deal with these matters in some states when it provides that rejections, counteroffers, and the exercise of an option are all effective when received, rather than when transmitted.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, the “mailbox rule” making acceptances effective when sent applies only in the common law nations. In the rest of the world, acceptances are effective when received. Indeed, now that the CISG is the law of the United States, the following rules apply here to international sale of goods transactions involving nationals of other ratifying states:</p>

<p class="indent">One situation in which it is justifiable to treat propositions that appear quite final as preliminary negotiations rather than operative offers is when the parties explicitly contemplate a final formal writing as their agreement. Then all that precedes the final formal writing can be considered talk. Yet sometimes the parties contemplate being bound by their agreement before it is reduced to a final formal writing. The formal writing is contemplated merely as a memorial or memorandum recording an agreement that the parties have already reached. In such a case, it is the talk that precedes the writing that is of primary importance. We have seen how the law, through the parol evidence rule and other devices, has sought to reduce the significance of oral negotiations when there is a final and complete written contract. But what happens if the final written agreement is never reached? Do the oral agreement and such preliminary writings as may exist constitute a contract? As has already been noted, this tension between the views that the agreement is the contract and that the writing is the contract is persistent and reappears throughout the law of contracts.</p>

<p class="indent">Most so-called rules do indicate at least something about what facts they apply to, <span class="italic">or</span> something about some legal consequence; and, mostly, <span class="italic">something</span> of both. But what needs note is that until even the most precise of expressions about legal consequences is guided to the facts which may emerge, the supposed rule can acquire no meaning <span class="italic">in life</span> (as distinct from, say, a meaning in logic.)</p>
<p class="indent">Take, for instance, in the Offer and Acceptance field, the two current formulations on when, pending execution of an intended writing, the expressions of agreement do, and when they do not, constitute offer and acceptance. The Restatement, [Second, Contracts § 27], says, in effect, that either may be the case. This is true. Comment (a) says that it is very reasonable that sometimes one should be the case, sometimes the other. This is also true. Comment (b) says that you can also phrase the issue as one between a mere memorial and the exclusive operative consummation. And this is true. Comment (c) says that even a memorial may operate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page702" class="pagebreak">702</span>to change an agreement reached without it. True no less. But further, deponent Restatement saith not. Result: the opinion can write (and often does) in precisely the same language for any case on the problem, no matter which way the case comes out, and almost no guidance is given by “the settled rule” as to what to fill in on the one blank space: “In our opinion this case falls clearly within the * * * branch of the rule.” Yet there is, and has been, good and shrewd judicial discussion of useful criteria to use—persuasive, too, I suggest, to any court to which it might be quoted—<span class="italic">because it helps.</span></p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">The following is the good and shrewd judicial discussion to which Professor Llewellyn refers:</p>
<p id="sec352" class="noindent">■ E<small>MERY</small>, J., in <span class="italic">Mississippi and Dominion Steamship Co. v. Swift</span>, 86 Me. 248, 258 (1894):</p>
<p class="indent">[I]t is quite clear that, after all, the question is mainly one of intention. If the party sought to be charged intended to close a contract prior to the formal signing of a written draft, or if he signified such an intention to the other party, he will be bound by the contract actually made, though the signing of the written draft be omitted. If on the other hand, such party neither had nor signified such an intention to close the contract until it was fully expressed in a written instrument and attested by signatures, then he will not be bound until the signatures are affixed. The expression of the idea may be attempted in other words: if the written draft is viewed by the parties merely as a convenient memorial, or record of their previous contract, its absence does not affect the binding force of the contract; if, however, it is viewed as the consummation of the negotiation, there is no contract until the written draft is finally signed.</p>
<p class="indent">In determining which view is entertained in any particular case, several circumstances may be helpful, as: [1] whether the contract is of that class which are usually found to be in writing; [2] whether it is of such nature as to need a formal writing for its full expression; [3] whether it has few or many details; [4] whether the amount involved is large or small; [5] whether it is a common or unusual contract; [6] whether the negotiations themselves indicate that a written draft is contemplated as the final conclusion of the negotiations. If a written draft is proposed, suggested or referred to, during the negotiations, it is some evidence that the parties intended it to be the final closing of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, with the aid of all rules and suggestions, the solution of the question is often difficult, doubtful and sometimes unsatisfactory.</p>

<p id="sec353" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Empro Mfg. Co. v. Ball–Co. Mfg.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1989.</p>
<p class="sectionb">870 F.2d 423.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ E<small>ASTERBROOK</small>, J. We have a pattern common in commercial life. Two firms reach concord on the general terms of their transaction. They sign a document, captioned “agreement in principle” or “letter of intent,” memorializing these terms but anticipating further negotiations and decisions—an appraisal of the assets, the clearing of a title, the list is endless. One of these terms proves divisive, and the deal collapses. The party that perceives itself the loser then claims that the preliminary document has legal force independent of the definitive contract. Ours is such a dispute.</p>
<p class="indent">Ball–Co Manufacturing, a maker of specialty valve components, floated its assets on the market. Empro Manufacturing showed interest. After some preliminary negotiations, Empro sent Ball–Co a three-page “letter of intent” to purchase the assets of Ball–Co and S.B. Leasing, a partnership holding title to the land under Ball–Co’s plant. Empro proposed a price of $2.4 million, with $650,000 to be paid on closing and a 10–year promissory note for the remainder, the note to be secured by the “inventory and equipment of Ballco.” The letter stated “[t]he general terms and conditions of such proposal (which will be subject to and incorporated in a formal, definitive Asset Purchase Agreement signed by both parties).” Just in case Ball–Co might suppose that Empro had committed itself to buy the assets, paragraph four of the letter stated that “Empro’s purchase shall be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent to closing including, but not limited to” the definitive Asset Purchase Agreement and, among five other conditions, “[t]he approval of the shareholders and board of directors of Empro.”</p>
<p class="indent">Although Empro left itself escape hatches, as things turned out Ball–Co was the one who balked. The parties signed the letter of intent in November 1987 and negotiated through March 1988 about many terms. Security for the note proved to be the sticking point. Ball–Co wanted a security interest in the land under the plant; Empro refused to yield.</p>
<p class="indent">When Empro learned that Ball–Co was negotiating with someone else, it filed this diversity suit. Contending that the letter of intent obliges Ball–Co to sell only to it, Empro asked for a temporary restraining order. The district judge set the case for a prompt hearing and, after getting a look at the letter of intent, dismissed the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. Relying on <span class="italic">Interway, Inc. v. Alagna</span> (Ill. App.1980), the district judge concluded that the statement, appearing twice in the letter, that the agreement is “subject to” the execution of a definitive contract meant that the letter has no independent force.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page704" class="pagebreak">704</div>
<p class="indent">Empro insists on appeal that the binding effect of a document depends on the parties’ intent, which means that the case may not be dismissed—for Empro says that the parties intended to be bound, a factual issue. Empro treats “intent to be bound” as a matter of the parties’ states of mind, but if intent were wholly subjective there would be no parol evidence rule, no contract case could be decided without a jury trial, and no one could know the effect of a commercial transaction until years after the documents were inked. That would be a devastating blow to business. Contract law gives effect to the parties’ wishes, but they must express these openly. Put differently, “intent” in contract law is objective rather than subjective—a point <span class="italic">Interway</span> makes by holding that as a matter of law parties who make their pact “subject to” a later definitive agreement have manifested an (objective) intent not to be bound, which under the parol evidence rule becomes the definitive intent even if one party later says that the true intent was different. As the Supreme Court of Illinois said in <span class="italic">Schek v. Chicago Transit Authority</span> (1969), “intent must be determined solely from the language used when no ambiguity in its terms exists.” Parties may decide for themselves whether the results of preliminary negotiations bind them, but they do this through their words.</p>
<p class="indent">Because letters of intent are written without the care that will be lavished on the definitive agreement, it may be a bit much to put dispositive weight on “subject to” in every case, and we do not read <span class="italic">Interway</span> as giving these the status of magic words. They might have been used carelessly, and if the full agreement showed that the formal contract was to be nothing but a memorial of an agreement already reached, the letter of intent would be enforceable. Conversely, Empro cannot claim comfort from the fact that the letter of intent does not contain a flat disclaimer, such as the one in <span class="italic">Feldman</span> pronouncing that the letter creates no obligations at all. The text and structure of the letter—the objective manifestations of intent—might show that the parties agreed to bind themselves to some extent immediately. <span class="italic">Borg–Warner</span> is such a case. One party issued an option, which called itself “firm and binding”; the other party accepted; the court found this a binding contract even though some terms remained open. After all, an option to purchase is nothing if not binding in advance of the definitive contract. The parties to <span class="italic">Borg–Warner</span> conceded that the option and acceptance usually would bind; the only argument in the case concerned whether the open terms were so important that a contract could not arise even if the parties wished to be bound, a subject that divided the court.</p>
<p class="indent">A canvass of the terms of the letter Empro sent does not assist it, however. “Subject to” a definitive agreement appears twice. The letter also recites, twice, that it contains the “general terms and conditions”, implying that each side retained the right to make (and stand on) additional demands. Empro insulated itself from binding effect by listing, among the conditions to which the deal was “subject”, the “approval of the shareholders and board of directors of Empro.” The board could <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page705" class="pagebreak">705</span>veto a deal negotiated by the firm’s agents for a reason such as the belief that Ball–Co had been offered too much (otherwise the officers, not the board, would be the firm’s final decisionmakers, yet state law vests major decisions in the board). The shareholders could decline to give their assent for any reason (such as distrust of new business ventures) and could not even be required to look at the documents, let alone consider the merits of the deal. Empro even took care to require the return of its $5,000 in earnest money “without set off, in the event this transaction is not closed,” although the seller usually gets to keep the earnest money if the buyer changes its mind. So Empro made clear that it was free to walk.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither the text nor the structure of the letter suggests that it was to be a one-sided commitment, an option in Empro’s favor binding only Ball–Co. From the beginning Ball–Co assumed that it could negotiate terms in addition to, or different from, those in the letter of intent. The cover letter from Ball–Co’s lawyer returning the signed letter of intent to Empro stated that the “terms and conditions are generally acceptable” but that “some clarifications are needed in Paragraph 3(c) (last sentence),” the provision concerning Ball–Co’s security interest. “Some clarifications are needed” is an ominous noise in a negotiation, foreboding many a stalemate. Although we do not know what “clarifications” counsel had in mind, the specifics are not important. It is enough that even on signing the letter of intent Ball–Co proposed to change the bargain, conduct consistent with the purport of the letter’s text and structure.</p>
<p class="indent">The shoals that wrecked this deal are common hazards in business negotiations. Letters of intent and agreements in principle often, and here, do no more than set the stage for negotiations on details. Sometimes the details can be ironed out; sometimes they can’t. Illinois, as <span class="italic">Chicago Investment</span>, <span class="italic">Interway</span>, and <span class="italic">Feldman</span> show, allows parties to approach agreement in stages, without fear that by reaching a preliminary understanding they have bargained away their privilege to disagree on the specifics. Approaching agreement by stages is a valuable method of doing business. So long as Illinois preserves the availability of this device, a federal court in a diversity case must send the disappointed party home empty-handed. Empro claims that it is entitled at least to recover its “reliance expenditures,” but the only expenditures it has identified are those normally associated with pre-contractual efforts: its complaint mentions the expenses “in negotiating with defendants, in investigating and reviewing defendants’ business, and in preparing to acquire defendants’ business.” Outlays of this sort cannot bind the other side any more than paying an expert to tell you whether the painting at the auction is a genuine Rembrandt compels the auctioneer to accept your bid.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page706" class="pagebreak">706</div>
<p id="sec354" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Is Empro arguing that it has an agreement to buy Ball–Co’s assets and therefore is entitled to expectancy damages for Ball–Co’s refusal to deliver? Or is it arguing that it has an agreement with Ball–Co to negotiate in good faith for the sale of assets, and Ball–Co should be prevented from negotiating with others in breach of its obligations to Empro? Although the parties may not be bound by a “definitive Asset Purchase Agreement,” do they have a distinct subsidiary agreement to work together in good faith to finalize such an agreement? While that effort is going on, may Ball–Co open negotiations with others? If the parties intended to establish an exclusive negotiation period by the letter of intent why isn’t that specifically provided for in the preliminary writing?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What specific “reliance expenditures” might Empro be seeking in this case?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Judge Easterbrook rejects the possibility that “paying an expert to tell you whether the painting at the auction is a genuine Rembrandt compels the auctioneer to accept your bid.” Fair enough, but if, by representing that it will sell the painting on a given date, the auction house induces potential buyers to spend many thousands of dollars on experts to examine the painting and test its genuineness, might the auctioneer incur some good faith obligations? For example, if, after inducing all those reliance expenditures, the auctioneer refuses without cause to recognize the bidder or excludes a bidder from the auction unjustifiably, might there not be some liability for the reliance losses suffered?</p>

<p id="sec355" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Arcadian Phosphates v. Arcadian Corp.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 1989.</p>
<p class="sectionb">884 F.2d 69.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ O<small>AKES</small>, C.J. This appeal is from a judgment in a diversity suit involving claims for breach of contract and promissory estoppel. The claims are based on a memorandum which described the sale of a fertilizer company’s phosphate fertilizer business to a joint venture. The appellants—the potential purchasers, consisting of the joint venture and two individuals involved in its formation—claim that the memorandum was a binding contract. The appellee—the potential seller, the fertilizer company—argues that the memorandum was an unenforceable “agreement to agree.” We affirm on appellants’ breach of contract claims. Because summary judgment was, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page707" class="pagebreak">707</span>however, inappropriate on appellants’ promissory estoppel claim, we reverse and remand for further consideration of that claim.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. F<small>ACTS</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Appellee Arcadian Corporation (“Arcadian”) is a New York corporation that manufactures and sells fertilizer. Appellant Arcadian Phosphates, Inc. (“API”) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 by appellants Judas Azuelos and Eli Sivan as a vehicle for the purchase of Arcadian’s phosphate fertilizer business. Azuelos, a citizen and resident of France, represents the Office Togolais Des Phosphates (“OTP”), the governmental entity in Togo that mines, markets, and exports phosphate rock. Sivan, a citizen of Israel and resident of the United Kingdom, was a businessman engaged in buying and selling Togolese phosphate rock on the world market, and is now the president, treasurer, and one of the directors of API.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1986, OTP became Arcadian’s chief supplier of phosphate. At the same time Arcadian, allegedly motivated by a sharp drop in the price of fertilizer, began negotiating the sale of its phosphate fertilizer facility in Geismar, Louisiana to API. In June 1986, the parties signed a four-page memorandum of understanding outlining areas of agreement concerning the assets to be purchased, the purchase price, and an option for Arcadian to purchase up to 20% of API. The memorandum also set deadlines for further action, all subject to the approval of Arcadian’s board and appellants’ ability to obtain financing. After such board approval and appellants’ successful but unconsummated search and after further negotiations, the parties signed a one-and-a-half page memorandum on November 6, 1986, that incorporated the June memorandum. It is this November 6 memorandum that appellants claim was a binding contract for the sale of Arcadian’s phosphate fertilizer business.</p>
<p class="indent">The November 6 memorandum, together with the June memorandum that was incorporated by reference, was termed an “agreement” though subject to approval by the boards of both OTP and Arcadian. It specified the purchase price, the timing and amounts of the payments, the fixed assets to be purchased, and a closing date of not later than May 31, 1987. It also outlined a framework of negotiation for the purchase of Arcadian’s finished product inventory at closing at a “mutually agreeable market value,” with phosphate stores to be purchased at closing at Arcadian’s book value. Other provisions were less definite: for example, the memorandum referred to part of the payment as “a note secured to Arcadian’s satisfaction” and to additional equity participants in the proposed joint venture as “subject to mutual agreement.” The November 6 memorandum provided that if negotiations for the sale failed, Arcadian would repay any capital expenditures agreed to thereafter and made by API, and if the negotiations failed through no fault of API, Arcadian would refund API’s deposit. The November 6 memorandum also stated that “the service and supply agreement will be negotiated and agreed to by December 31, 1986” and “[a] binding sales agreement will be completed by December 31, 1986.” Finally, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page708" class="pagebreak">708</span>both parties agreed to the memorandum “to cooperate fully and work judiciously in order to expedite the closing date and consummate the sale of the business.”</p>
<p class="indent">By November 14, 1986, the Arcadian board unanimously approved what Arcadian’s CEO then called the “proposed agreement”—though the CEO now says that the board only approved of his proceeding with negotiations. The November 6 memorandum was also approved by OTP. The parties then confirmed by Telex their respective approvals and took steps to consummate the transaction. According to the appellants, these included establishment of API offices at Arcadian headquarters; Arcadian’s obtaining lenders’ consents after informing them of the “agreed upon” sale with a “signed agreement”; introduction of Azuelos and Sivan to one supplier as “new owners”; and beginning the negotiation of supply contracts for API.</p>
<p class="indent">On November 26, API tendered a cash deposit of $687,500 as required. Arcadian executed an escrow agreement for the deposit, referring to the parties’ “agreement” and pursuant to which the deposit was to be non-refundable except “because of force majeure or Sellers’ default.” The minutes of an Arcadian directors’ meeting on December 11, 1986, reflect the deposit payment and say that “[f]inal negotiations are continuing to work out the necessary service and marketing agreements,” with a closing date of the “venture” to be “no later than May 31, 1987.”</p>
<p class="indent">On December 17, 1986, Arcadian agreed in writing that its option for 20% minority participation in API could be reduced by API to as low as 5% to enable API to secure financing. API also incurred, it is alleged, expenses of over $100,000 to install “fenders” at Arcadian docking facilities in Geismar, Louisiana, in order to permit the discharge of Togolese rock. API also obtained a bank commitment for the $7 million required for its cash payment toward the $13.75 million purchase price and allegedly entered into a long-term rock supply contract with OTP. According to appellants, Arcadian did not undertake to enter any 1987 supply contract, but merely extended its existing contract pending the closing. And in January 1987 Arcadian allegedly commissioned a survey which designated which portions of the land and buildings were to go to API and which to remain with Arcadian.</p>
<p class="indent">However, as the minutes of the Arcadian board meeting of February 26, 1987, reflect, the market for phosphates changed “dramatically” with market prices of diammonium phosphate, apparently the bellwether of the industry, going up 25% in four to five weeks, production levels increasing, and inventories being depleted. The same board minutes noted:</p>
<p class="bqs">[API] is pushing for an early closing and therefore is attempting to lock up financing as soon as possible. However, major issues and concerns still exist from Arcadian’s point of view and need to be resolved. The major issues to be negotiated involve inventory <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page709" class="pagebreak">709</span>transfer, charges for SG &amp; A expenses and insurance coverage. The concerns of Arcadian are the need for retention by Arcadian of majority ownership and control of [API] and the long-term affect [sic] on the nitrogen business. After extended discussion it was the consensus of the Board that Arcadian could not proceed with the joint venture as originally contemplated. In order to proceed with any potential joint venture of the phosphate business, it was the consensus of the Board that Arcadian must have majority ownership and management of the venture and the other open issues must be resolved to Arcadian’s satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indent">When Arcadian informed API of its change of position—from agreeing to own 5% to 20% of the joint venture (at API’s option) to wanting to own 50%–plus and returning the down payment—this suit ensued.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II. D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">A. Breach of Contract</span></p>
<p class="indent">As appellants urge, we examine their breach of contract claims under a framework devised by Judge Leval in <span class="italic">Teachers Insurance &amp; Annuity Association v. Tribune Co.</span>, 670 F.Supp. 491 (S.D.N.Y.1987). In <span class="italic">Tribune,</span> Judge Leval surveyed the doctrine on preliminary agreements, like the one in this case, noting that “[a] primary concern for courts in such disputes is to avoid trapping parties in surprise contractual obligations that they never intended.” Therefore, the judge concluded, “[m]ore is needed than agreement on each detail [to create a binding obligation. There must be] overall agreement * * * to enter into the binding contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Tribune,</span> Judge Leval identified two types of preliminary agreements. In the first, the parties have reached complete agreement on all of the issues that require negotiation, but they have not yet completely formalized their agreement. In the second, the parties have committed themselves to some major terms, but some terms will remain to be negotiated—as is the case with the memorandum at issue here. “The parties can bind themselves to a concededly incomplete agreement,” Judge Leval said of this second type, “in the sense that they accept a mutual commitment to negotiate together in good faith in an effort to reach final agreement within the scope that has been settled in the preliminary agreement.”</p>
<p class="indent">To determine whether a preliminary manifestation of assent was a binding preliminary agreement of the second type, Judge Leval used a modified version of a test that this court devised for preliminary agreements that more closely resemble the first type. Judge Leval considered whether the intent to be bound was revealed by (1) the language of the agreement; (2) the context of the negotiations; (3) the existence of open terms; (4) partial performance; and (5) the necessity of putting the agreement in final form, as indicated by the customary form of such transactions. The first factor, the language of agreement, is the most important.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page710" class="pagebreak">710</div>
<p class="indent">In applying the <span class="italic">Tribune</span> test to this case, we need look no further than the first factor. The language of the November memorandum—two references to the possibility that negotiations might fail and the reference to a binding sales agreement to be completed at some future date—shows that Arcadian did not intend to be bound…. In <span class="italic">Tribune,</span> a letter described itself as a “binding agreement,” and in <span class="italic">Butler,</span> the parties agreed that their agreement was binding. This fact was critical to Judge Leval’s reasoning in <span class="italic">Tribune:</span> “[A] party that does not wish to be bound,” he said, “can very easily protect itself by not accepting language that indicates a ‘firm commitment’ or ‘binding agreement.’” Conversely, a party that <span class="italic">wishes</span> to be bound can very easily protect itself by refusing to accept language that shows an intent <span class="italic">not</span> to be bound. In order to prevail on the breach of contract claims, Arcadian needed to show only that API “should have known that [Arcadian] did not intend to be bound before the [final] contract was signed.” The language of the November memorandum reveals just that: API should not have believed that Arcadian intended to be bound.</p>
<p class="indent">As Judge Leval noted in <span class="italic">Tribune,</span> “There is a strong presumption against finding binding obligation in agreements which include open terms, call for future approvals and expressly anticipate future preparation and execution of contract documents.” In <span class="italic">Tribune</span>, the language of the agreement argued persuasively for overcoming this presumption; here, the language of the agreement argues persuasively for letting the presumption stand.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants argue that the question whether a contract exists is ill-suited for summary judgment. On the contrary: Where “a question of intention is determinable by written agreements, the question is one of the law, appropriately decided * * * on a motion for summary judgment.” Since in this case intent can readily be determined by examining the November memorandum, summary judgment was perfectly appropriate even though there was considerable partial performance.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">B. Promissory Estoppel</span></p>
<p class="indent">Summary judgment was not appropriate, however, on appellants’ promissory estoppel claim. In New York, promissory estoppel has three elements: “a clear and unambiguous promise; a reasonable and foreseeable reliance by the party to whom the promise is made; and an injury sustained by the party asserting the estoppel by reason of his reliance.” Prevailing on a promissory estoppel claim, however, sometimes entitles a party only to its out-of-pocket expenses, rather than to benefit-of-the-bargain damages.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_139" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-139" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page711" class="pagebreak">711</div>
<p class="indent">Appellants’ promissory estoppel claim is based on evidence that Arcadian knew and approved of API’s expenditures and collateral contracts, but Arcadian suddenly demanded a majority interest in API when the phosphate fertilizer business became “dramatically” profitable. When appellants rejected Arcadian’s proposed modification of the latter’s equity position, appellants say Arcadian called off negotiations—thereby violating its promise to bargain in good faith. Because appellants’ allegations raise genuine issues of material fact as to whether Arcadian made a clear, unambiguous promise to negotiate in good faith, whether appellants reasonably and foreseeably relied on that promise in entering into expenditures and collateral contracts with suppliers or others, and whether appellants thereby sustained an injury, the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their promissory estoppel claim.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_140" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-140" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">We therefore affirm as to appellants’ breach of contract claims, but reverse and remand as to their promissory estoppel claim.</p>
<p id="sec356" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. This case was decided the same year as <span class="italic">Empro v. Ball–Co.</span> Are the results consistent?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Does it make sense to speak of the agreement in <span class="italic">Arcadian</span> as not binding when the court leaves open the possibility of reliance-based damages?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The court appears to be using the terminology “breach of contract” to describe API’s claim to performance of the contract of sale and joint venture, and the term “promissory estoppel” to describe Arcadian’s obligations to negotiate in good faith and API’s claim for “out-of-pocket expenses.” This appears to be a somewhat different usage of the term “promissory estoppel” than has been used in earlier cases in this Casebook. That is, usually promissory estoppel refers to promises made binding by unbargained-for action in reliance, in contrast to promises that become <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page712" class="pagebreak">712</span>binding because of consideration. In this case, if API is found to have relied on Arcadian’s promises to negotiate a deal in good faith, wasn’t that reliance bargainedfor, that is, wasn’t there an exchange of the promise for this action in reliance which Arcadian sought to induce API to take?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. If API is successful at trial, what will its damages be? The court mentions out-of-pocket expenses. That probably will include the $100,000 to install fenders at the docking facility in Louisiana. Will its recovery also include API’s costs of extricating itself from the arrangements it made with the bank? How about the lost opportunities to make deals with others that API gave up to invest its energies in negotiating with Arcadian?</p>

<p id="sec357" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">St. Jude Medical v. Medtronic</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Minnesota Court of Appeals, 1995.</p>
<p class="sectionb">536 N.W.2d 24.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ H<small>USPENI</small>, J….</p>
<p class="indent">This case arises out of the merger and acquisition of respondent Electromedics, Inc., a company which designs, manufactures, and markets medical equipment and disposable devices, focusing on blood therapy and surgical care. Both appellant St. Jude Medical, Inc., and respondent Medtronic, Inc., sought to acquire Electromedics.</p>
<p class="indent">Medtronic purchased 346,359 shares of Electromedics’ stock between March and August 1993. In July 1993, Medtronic presented an unsolicited merger proposal of $5.50 per share; Electromedics rejected the offer outright, but realized that the company was on the market despite the fact that it had “not plan[ned] to be for sale.”</p>
<p class="indent">Electromedics hired Dain Bosworth as its financial advisor to consider “strategic alternatives” for the company’s future. Eighteen potential buyers surfaced. The Electromedics board of directors decided to auction off the company to secure the best price for the shareholders.</p>
<p class="indent">St. Jude hired Piper Jaffray Inc. as its financial advisor for the exclusive purpose of proposing the acquisition or merger with Electromedics. As of November 4, 1993, St. Jude was an active contender in the competition for merger. St. Jude expressed a strong interest in purchasing Electromedics under the condition that St. Jude would have an exclusive right to negotiate and would receive a termination fee, which would be $2–4 million, in the event negotiations fell through.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page713" class="pagebreak">713</div>
<p class="indent">On November 12, Medtronic formally proposed a merger at $6.125 per share. The Electromedics board considered the offer inadequate, but did not give Medtronic an answer.</p>
<p class="indent">By December 6, Electromedics entered into a final agreement and merger plan with St. Jude. The exclusive agreement required Electromedics to refrain from marketing the sale of the company or contacting other “suitors.” The agreement also included the following “termination fee” provision:</p>
<p class="bqsi">In recognition of the efforts and expenses expended and incurred by [St. Jude] with respect to Electromedics and the opportunity Electromedics presents to [St. Jude], if (i) this Agreement is terminated * * *, Electromedics will pay to [St. Jude] within five business days after demand by [St. Jude] * * * a termination fee equal to $3,000,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">No fee would be due if a court prohibited the merger, if the Electromedics board did not approve the merger, or if St. Jude breached the agreement. St. Jude’s final bid was $6.375 per share.</p>
<p class="indent">The day after news of the merger reached the press, Medtronic sent Electromedics a new formal offer of $6.75 per share. St. Jude agreed to match that bid. Medtronic then increased its bid to $6.875 per share and put $3 million in escrow to cover the possible termination fee to St. Jude.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_141" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-141" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> St. Jude made it clear that it expected Electromedics to pay the $3 million termination fee if it accepted Medtronic’s bid.</p>
<p class="indent">On December 22, the Electromedics board authorized a merger with Medtronic at $6.875 per share, for a total of $97 million. When Electromedics informed St. Jude of its decision, St. Jude demanded payment of the termination fee. The merger agreement with Medtronic prohibited Electromedics from paying the fee without Medtronic’s prior written consent. When Electromedics failed to pay the fee, St. Jude brought this action, alleging breach of contract, unjust enrichment, tortious interference with contract, and a claim for attorney fees and costs.</p>
<p class="indent">In March 1994, St. Jude moved for summary judgment and Electromedics/Medtronic moved to dismiss St. Jude’s claims. In denying both motions, the district court, noting that “many [jurisdictions] have upheld termination fees,” chose to use a “liquidated damages analysis to determine the validity of the fee provision in question.” After addressing the factors used to determine whether a liquidated damages provision is, in fact, a penalty rather than a reasonable estimate of actual damages, the court stated: “[I]nsufficient evidence has been presented to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page714" class="pagebreak">714</span>the Court to allow it to conclude, as a matter of law, that the termination fee is a penalty rather than a valid liquidated damages provision.”</p>
<p class="indent">After a December 1994 hearing … Electromedics/Medtronic’s motion for summary judgment was granted. This court concluded:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Electromedics did not intend to liquidate [St. Jude’s] damages when they agreed to the three million dollar penalty fee. [St. Jude’s] candid concession through its counsel at oral arguments is a binding judicial admission evincing the intent of the parties in regards to the liquidated damages. Accordingly, [St. Jude] cannot carry its burden of establishing the first element of its first claim for relief. Therefore, the three million dollar penalty provision is void and will not be enforced.</p>
<p class="indent">In the corporate world, termination fees are a common and generally accepted method to “reimburse the prospective purchaser for expenditures incurred in pursuing the transaction.” <span class="italic">Gray v. Zondervan Corp</span>. (W.D.Mich.1988).</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Cancellation fee provisions typically require the [seller] to pay the bidder a specified dollar amount. * * * [T]he fee ordinarily ranges from one to five percent of the proposed acquisition price. A cancellation fee reduces the risk of entering a negotiated merger by guaranteeing the initial bidder reimbursement for the out of pocket costs associated with making the offer and, in some instances, for the bidder’s lost time and opportunities. Accordingly, they are increasingly common in negotiated acquisitions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Stephen M. Bainbridge, <span class="italic">Exclusive Merger Agreements and Lock–Ups in Negotiated Corporate Acquisitions</span>, 75 M<small>INN</small>.L.R<small>EV</small>. 239, 246 (1990).</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to Electromedics/Medtronic’s assertion that termination fees are inherently invalid and unenforceable,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_142" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-142" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> the law generally accepts them as long as they do not encroach upon the ultimate purpose of the acquisition process: to sell a company to the highest bidder and maximize the shareholders’ profits.</p>
<p class="indent">State and federal courts have upheld termination fees when a well-informed board negotiated the fee in good faith, with no apparent conflict of interest, and followed responsible procedure, when the amount of the termination fee is reasonable in relation to the bidder’s efforts and the magnitude of the transaction, and when the reasonable and fully-disclosed fee does not hinder a board vote on the overall merger/sales transaction.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page715" class="pagebreak">715</div>
<p class="indent">The parties here, with the benefit of legal counsel and financial advisors, negotiated the termination fee as part of the merger agreement. The $3 million fee is reasonable as it is only a small percentage of the total $90 million contract sales price. Most importantly, the termination fee provision brought St. Jude into the auction as a committed bidder for purchase, and was a catalyst for the bidding contest that ultimately resulted in Electromedics receiving a bid close to its market value. For these reasons, we conclude the termination fee provision was valid and enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">The district court, however, applied a liquidated damages analysis to this case and invalidated the termination fee as an unenforceable penalty because St. Jude admitted that it never intended to liquidate damages.</p>
<p class="indent">We are aware that termination fee provisions have been likened to liquidated damage provisions. A liquidated damages analysis is inappropriate here, however, because this case lacks the breach of contract necessary to invoke such analysis. By definition, a party may establish a claim for liquidated damages only when it proves three essential elements: (1) the parties intended to liquidate damages; (2) at the time the parties made the contract, the amount of liquidated damages was a reasonable estimate of the presumed actual damages that the breach would cause; and (3) at the time the parties made the contract, it was difficult to determine the amount of actual damages that would result from a breach. Implicit in each of these elements is the breach of a contract. One court has aptly defined liquidated damages as</p>
<p class="blockquote">the sum a party to a contract agrees to pay if he breaks some promise, and which, having been arrived at by a good faith effort to estimate in advance the actual damage that will probably ensue from the breach, is legally recoverable as agreed damages if the breach occurs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, “damages,” by their very nature, mean “compensation in money as a substitute for and the equivalent of the promised performance.” <span class="italic">Westmount Country Club v. Kameny</span> (NJ Super. 1964); Corbin on Contracts § 990.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties agree that no breach occurred here when Electromedics accepted Medtronic’s bid rather than St. Jude’s; the merger agreement allowed Electromedics to choose a course of action: either accept St. Jude’s offer or select another buyer and pay St. Jude the termination fee. Electromedics exercised a contract right when it chose to accept Medtronic’s offer; that decision did not breach the merger agreement with St. Jude. Without an underlying breach of contract, the court cannot apply a liquidated damages analysis to this case. Thus, the … district court erred when it … applied a liquidated damages analysis to the facts of this case and interpret[ed] the candid admission of counsel for St. Jude that there was “no intention of liquidating damages” as requiring a conclusion that the termination provision must be an unenforceable penalty.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page716" class="pagebreak">716</div>
<p class="indent">Because the merger agreement gave Electromedics a choice of performance, we believe it is appropriate to liken the termination fee provision to an alternative performance contract.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative contract is one in which a party promises to render some one of two or more alternative performances either one of which is mutually agreed upon as the bargained-for-equivalent given in exchange for the return performance by the other party. Corbin at § 1079.</p>
<p class="blockquote">[S]ome alternative contracts giving the power of choice between the alternatives to the promisor can easily be confused with contracts that provide for the payment of liquidated damages in case of breach, provided that one of the alternatives is the payment of a sum of money. * * * If, upon a proper interpretation of the contract, it is found that the parties have agreed that either one of the two alternative performances is to be given by the promisor and received by the promisee as the agreed exchange and equivalent for the return performance rendered by the promisee, the contract is a true alternative contract. This is true even though one of the alternative performances is the payment of a liquidated sum of money; that fact does not make the contract one for the rendering of a single performance with a provision for liquidated damages in case of breach.</p>
<p class="noindent">Corbin at § 1082.</p>
<p class="indent">Electromedics/Medtronic contend that the termination fee provision was not an alternative performance contract because St. Jude was not obligated to perform in exchange for the $3 million termination fee that Electromedics would pay. In making this argument, Electromedics and Medtronic overlook the nuances of the merger agreement and the auction process.</p>
<p class="indent">The record shows that the parties drafted the merger agreement to cover two stages—the auction period as well as the purchase and merger. The merger agreement committed St. Jude as a purchaser of Electromedics and, thereby, increased the stakes in the auction. When St. Jude signed the merger agreement, it presented itself as a viable contender for purchase: St. Jude had already hired financial advisors, undergone complex financial analysis and preparation, and taken the risk publicly to commit to the merger.</p>
<p class="indent">The history of the auction proves that St. Jude’s initial bid, and later its willingness to increase the bid, caused Medtronic to increase its own bid twice and to offer a purchase price near Electromedics’ actual market value. This sequence of events is remarkable, considering that Medtronic’s initial unsolicited bid had been far below Electromedics’ market value. Ultimately, Electromedics sold for $11 million more than it would have before St. Jude became a contender in the acquisition.</p>
<p class="indent">The merger agreement between Electromedics and St. Jude enhanced the bidding and maximized the shareholders’ profits. The record shows the termination <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page717" class="pagebreak">717</span>fee in this case worked, as St. Jude contends, “exactly as it should have.” During that first stage of the contract, St. Jude performed by actively participating in the auction. Electromedics agreed to perform by paying a termination fee if the parties’ negotiations ended after this first stage and never progressed to the merger with St. Jude.</p>
<p class="indent">In the second stage of the contract, St. Jude would have performed by purchasing Electromedics for $90 million and Electromedics would have performed by approving the sale. Implicit in the parties’ agreement, however, is the fact that they would never have reached this second stage if Electromedics chose to sell to another company. The merger agreement gave Electromedics the choice to end at stage one or proceed to stage two.</p>
<p class="indent">When Electromedics selected Medtronic as its buyer, Electromedics terminated its merger agreement with St. Jude at stage one, after St. Jude had already provided consideration for the contract. Given that Electromedics chose to terminate the contract at that stage, Electromedics still had the duty to perform by paying St. Jude the $3 million termination fee.</p>
<p class="indent">The district court erred when it applied a liquidated damages analysis to this case and invalidated the termination fee as an unenforceable penalty. The termination fee provision is a valid and enforceable contract between the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">… We reverse summary judgment on the termination fee provision and direct the district court to enter judgment of $3 million in favor of St. Jude….</p>

<p class="sectionb">Wisconsin Supreme Court, 1965.</p>
<p class="sectionb">26 Wis.2d 683, 133 N.W.2d 267.</p>
<p class="indent">Action by Joseph Hoffman (hereinafter “Hoffman”) and wife, plaintiffs, against defendants Red Owl Stores, Inc. (hereinafter “Red Owl”) and Edward Lukowitz.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page718" class="pagebreak">718</div>
<p class="indent">The complaint alleged that Lukowitz, as agent for Red Owl, represented to and agreed with plaintiffs that Red Owl would build a store building in Chilton and stock it with merchandise for Hoffman to operate in return for which plaintiffs were to put up and invest a total sum of $18,000; that in reliance upon the above-mentioned agreement and representations plaintiffs sold their bakery building and business and their grocery store and business; also in reliance on the agreement and representations Hoffman purchased the building site in Chilton and rented a residence for himself and his family in Chilton; plaintiffs’ actions in reliance on the representations and agreement disrupted their personal and business life; plaintiffs lost substantial amounts of income and expended large sums of money as expenses. Plaintiffs demanded recovery of damages for the breach of defendants’ representations and agreements.</p>
<p class="indent">The action was tried to a court and jury. The facts hereinafter stated are taken from the evidence adduced at the trial. Where there was a conflict in the evidence the version favorable to plaintiffs has been accepted since the verdict rendered was in favor of plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="indent">Hoffman assisted by his wife operated a bakery at Wautoma from 1956 until sale of the building late in 1961. The building was owned in joint tenancy by him and his wife. Red Owl is a Minnesota corporation having its home office at Hopkins, Minnesota. It owns and operates a number of grocery supermarket stores and also extends franchises to agency stores which are owned by individuals, partnerships, and corporations. Lukowitz resides at Green Bay and since September, 1960, has been divisional manager for Red Owl in a territory comprising Upper Michigan and most of Wisconsin in charge of 84 stores. Prior to September, 1960, he was district manager having charge of approximately 20 stores.</p>
<p class="indent">In November, 1959, Hoffman was desirous of expanding his operations by establishing a grocery store and contacted a Red Owl representative by the name of Jansen, now deceased. Numerous conversations were had in 1960 with the idea of establishing a Red Owl franchise store in Wautoma. In September, 1960, Lukowitz succeeded Jansen as Red Owl’s representative in the negotiations. Hoffman mentioned that $18,000 was all the capital he had available to invest and he was repeatedly assured that this would be sufficient to set him up in business as a Red Owl store. About Christmastime, 1960, Hoffman thought it would be a good idea if he bought a small grocery store in Wautoma and operated it in order that he gain experience in the grocery business prior to operating a Red Owl store in some larger community. On February 6, 1961, on the advice of Lukowitz and Sykes, who had succeeded Lukowitz as Red Owl’s district manager, Hoffman bought the inventory and fixtures of a small grocery store in Wautoma and leased the building in which it was operated.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page719" class="pagebreak">719</div>
<p class="indent">After three months of operating this Wautoma store, the Red Owl representatives came in and took inventory and checked the operations and found the store was operating at a profit. Lukowitz advised Hoffman to sell the store to his manager, and assured him that Red Owl would find a larger store for him elsewhere. Acting on this advice and assurance, Hoffman sold the fixtures and inventory to his manager on June 6, 1961. Hoffman was reluctant to sell at that time because it meant losing the summer tourist business, but he sold on the assurance that he would be operating in a new location by fall and that he must sell this store if he wanted a bigger one. Before selling, Hoffman told the Red Owl representatives that he had $18,000 for “getting set up in business” and they assured him that there would be no problems in establishing him in a bigger operation. The makeup of the $18,000 was not discussed; it was understood plaintiff’s father-in-law would furnish part of it. By June, 1961, the towns for the new grocery store had been narrowed down to two, Kewaunee and Chilton. In Kewaunee, Red Owl had an option on a building site. In Chilton, Red Owl had nothing under option, but it did select a site to which plaintiff obtained an option at Red Owl’s suggestion. The option stipulated a purchase price of $6,000 with $1,000 to be paid on election to purchase and the balance to be paid within thirty days. On Lukowitz’s assurance that everything was all set plaintiff paid $1,000 down on the lot on September 15th.</p>
<p class="indent">On September 27, 1961, plaintiff met at Chilton with Lukowitz and Mr. Reymund and Mr. Carlson from the home office who prepared a projected financial statement. Part of the funds plaintiffs were to supply as their investment in the venture were to be obtained by sale of their Wautoma bakery building.</p>
<p class="indent">On the basis of this meeting Lukowitz assured Hoffman: “* * * [E]verything is ready to go. Get your money together and we are set.” Shortly after this meeting Lukowitz told plaintiffs that they would have to sell their bakery business and bakery building, and that their retaining this property was the only “hitch” in the entire plan. On November 6, 1961, plaintiffs sold their bakery building for $10,000. Hoffman was to retain the bakery equipment as he contemplated using it to operate a bakery in connection with his Red Owl store. After sale of the bakery Hoffman obtained employment on the night shift at an Appleton bakery.</p>
<p class="indent">[During the next four months there were numerous detailed meetings between the parties, at which Red Owl’s agents discussed financing arrangements for the new store. A dispute developed and the negotiations broke down.]</p>
<p class="indent">The case was submitted to the jury on a special verdict with the first two questions answered by the court. This verdict, as returned by the jury, was as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquotes"><span class="italic">Question No. 1:</span> Did the Red Owl Stores, Inc., and Joseph Hoffmann on or about mid-May of 1961 initiate negotiations looking to the establishment of Joseph Hoffmann as a franchise operator of a Red Owl Store in Chilton?</p>

<p class="indent">Plaintiffs moved for judgment on the verdict while defendants moved to change the answers to Questions 3, 4, 5, and 6 from “Yes” to “No,” and in the alternative for relief from the answers to the subdivisions of Question 7 or a new trial. On March 31, 1964, the circuit court entered the following order:</p>

<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Applicability of Doctrine to Facts of this Case</span></p>
<p class="indent">The record here discloses a number of promises and assurances given to Hoffman by Lukowitz in behalf of Red Owl upon which plaintiffs relied and acted upon to their detriment.</p>
<p class="indent">Foremost were the promises that for the sum of $18,000 Red Owl would establish Hoffman in a store. After Hoffman had sold his grocery store and paid the $1,000 on the Chilton lot, the $18,000 figure was changed to $24,100. Then in November, 1961, Hoffman was assured that if the $24,100 figure were increased by $2,000 the deal would go through. Hoffman was induced to sell his grocery store fixtures and inventory in June, 1961, on the promise that he would be in his new store by fall. In November, plaintiffs sold their bakery building on the urging of defendants and on the assurance that this was the last step necessary to have the deal with Red Owl go through.</p>
<p class="indent">We determine that there was ample evidence to sustain the answers of the jury to the questions of the verdict with respect to the promissory representations made by Red Owl, Hoffman’s reliance thereon in the exercise of ordinary care, and his fulfillment of the conditions required of him by the terms of the negotiations had with Red Owl.</p>
<p class="indent">There remains for consideration the question of law raised by defendants that agreement was never reached on essential factors necessary to establish a contract between Hoffman and Red Owl. Among these were the size, cost, design, and layout of the store building; and the terms of the lease with respect to rent, maintenance, renewal, and purchase options. This poses the question of whether the promise necessary to sustain a cause of action for promissory estoppel must embrace all essential details of a proposed transaction between promisor and promisee so as to be the equivalent of an offer that would result in a binding contract between the parties if the promisee were to accept the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Originally the doctrine of promissory estoppel was invoked as a substitute for consideration rendering a gratuitous promise enforceable as a contract. In other words, the acts of reliance by the promisee to his detriment provided a substitute for consideration. If promissory estoppel were to be limited to only those situations where the promise giving rise to the cause of action must be so definite with respect <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page722" class="pagebreak">722</span>to all details that a contract would result were the promise supported by consideration, then the defendants’ instant promises to Hoffman would not meet this test. However, sec. 90 of Restatement, 1 Contracts, does not impose the requirement that the promise giving rise to the cause of action must be so comprehensive in scope as to meet the requirements of an offer that would ripen into a contract if accepted by the promisee. Rather the conditions imposed are:</p>
<p class="blockquote">(1) Was the promise one which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee?</p>
<p class="blockquote">(2) Did the promise induce such action or forbearance?</p>
<p class="blockquote">(3) Can injustice be avoided only by enforcement of the promise?</p>
<p class="indent">We deem it would be a mistake to regard an action grounded on promissory estoppel as the equivalent of a breach-of-contract action. As Dean Boyer points out, it is desirable that fluidity in the application of the concept be maintained. 98 U. Pa. L. Rev. 459 (1950). While the first two of the above-listed three requirements of promissory estoppel present issues of fact which ordinarily will be resolved by a jury, the third requirement, that the remedy can only be invoked where necessary to avoid injustice, is one that involves a policy decision by the court. Such a policy decision necessarily embraces an element of discretion.</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that injustice would result here if plaintiffs were not granted some relief because of the failure of defendants to keep their promises which induced plaintiffs to act to their detriment.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Damages</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants attack all the items of damages awarded by the jury.</p>
<p class="indent">The bakery building at Wautoma was sold at defendants’ instigation in order that Hoffman might have the net proceeds available as part of the cash capital he was to invest in the Chilton store venture. The evidence clearly establishes that it was sold at a loss of $2,000. Defendants contend that half of this loss was sustained by Mrs. Hoffman because title stood in joint tenancy. They point out that no dealings took place between her and defendants as all negotiations were had with her husband. Ordinarily only the promisee and not third persons are entitled to enforce the remedy of promissory estoppel against the promisor. However, if the promisor actually foresees, or has reason to foresee, action by a third person in reliance on the promise, it may be quite unjust to refuse to perform the promise. Here not only did defendants foresee that it would be necessary for Mrs. Hoffman to sell her joint interest in the bakery building, but defendants actually requested that this be done. We approve the jury’s award of $2,000 damages for the loss incurred by both plaintiffs in this sale.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page723" class="pagebreak">723</div>
<p class="indent">Defendants attack on two grounds the $1,000 awarded because of Hoffman’s payment of that amount on the purchase price of the Chilton lot. The first is that this $1,000 had already been lost at the time the final negotiations with Red Owl fell through in January, 1962, because the remaining $5,000 of purchase price had been due on October 15, 1961. The record does not disclose that the lot owner had foreclosed Hoffman’s interest in the lot for failure to pay this $5,000. The $1,000 was not paid for the option, but had been paid as part of the purchase price at the time Hoffman elected to exercise the option. This gave him an equity in the lot which could not be legally foreclosed without affording Hoffman an opportunity to pay the balance. The second ground of attack is that the lot may have had a fair market value of $6,000, and Hoffman should have paid the remaining $5,000 of purchase price. We determine that it would be unreasonable to require Hoffman to have invested an additional $5,000 in order to protect the $1,000 he had paid. Therefore, we find no merit to defendants’ attack upon this item of damages.</p>
<p class="indent">We also determine it was reasonable for Hoffman to have paid $125 for one month’s rent of a home in Chilton after defendants assured him everything would be set when plaintiff sold the bakery building. This was a proper item of damage.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs never moved to Chilton because defendants suggested that Hoffman get some experience by working in a Red Owl store in the Fox River Valley. Plaintiffs, therefore, moved to Neenah instead of Chilton. After moving, Hoffman worked at night in an Appleton bakery but held himself available for work in a Red Owl store. The $140 moving expense would not have been incurred if plaintiffs had not sold their bakery building in Wautoma in reliance upon defendants’ promises. We consider the $140 moving expense to be a proper item of damage.</p>
<p class="indent">We turn now to the damage item with respect to which the trial court granted a new trial, i.e., that arising from the sale of the Wautoma grocery-store fixtures and inventory for which the jury awarded $16,735. The trial court ruled that Hoffman could not recover for any loss of future profits for the summer months following the sale on June 6, 1961, but that damages would be limited to the difference between the sales price received and the fair market value of the assets sold, giving consideration to any goodwill attaching thereto by reason of the transfer of a going business. There was no direct evidence presented as to what this fair market value was on June 6, 1961. The evidence did disclose that Hoffman paid $9,000 for the inventory, added $1,500 to it and sold it for $10,000 or a loss of $500. His 1961 federal income-tax return showed that the grocery equipment had been purchased for $7,000 and sold for $7,955.96. Plaintiffs introduced evidence of the buyer that during the first eleven weeks of operation of the grocery store his gross sales were $44,000 and his profit was $6,000 or roughly 15 percent. On cross-examination he admitted that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page724" class="pagebreak">724</span>this was gross and not net profit. Plaintiffs contend that in a breach-of-contract action damages may include loss of profits. However, this is not a breach-of-contract action.</p>
<p class="indent">The only relevancy of evidence relating to profits would be with respect to proving the element of goodwill in establishing the fair market value of the grocery inventory and fixtures sold. Therefore, evidence of profits would be admissible to afford a foundation for expert opinion as to fair market value.</p>
<p class="indent">Where damages are awarded in promissory estoppel instead of specifically enforcing the promisor’s promise, they should be only such as in the opinion of the court are necessary to prevent injustice. Mechanical or rule-of-thumb approaches to the damage problem should be avoided. In discussing remedies to be applied by courts in promissory estoppel we quote the following views of writers on the subject:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Enforcement of a promise does not necessarily mean Specific Performance. It does not necessarily mean Damages for breach. Moreover the amount allowed as Damages may be determined by the plaintiff’s expenditures or change of position in reliance as well as by the value to him of the promised performance. Restitution is also an ‘enforcing’ remedy, although it is often said to be based upon some kind of a rescission. In determining what justice requires, the court must remember all of its powers, derived from equity, law merchant, and other sources, as well as the common law. Its decree should be molded accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent">1A Corbin, Contracts, § 200.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The wrong is not primarily in depriving the plaintiff of the promised reward but in causing the plaintiff to change position to his detriment. It would follow that the damages should not exceed the loss caused by the change of position, which would never be more in amount, but might be less, than the promised reward.</p>
<p class="noindent">Seavey, <span class="italic">Reliance on Gratuitous Promises or Other Conduct</span>, 64 Harv. L. Rev. 913 (1951).</p>
<p class="indent">“There likewise seems to be no positive legal requirement, and certainly no legal policy, which dictates the allowance of contract damages in every case where the defendant’s duty is consensual.” Shattuck, <span class="italic">Gratuitous Promises—A New Writ</span>?, 35 Mich. L. Rev. 908 (1936).</p>
<p class="indent">At the time Hoffman bought the equipment and inventory of the small grocery store at Wautoma he did so in order to gain experience in the grocery-store business. At that time discussion had already been had with Red Owl representatives that Wautoma might be too small for a Red Owl operation and that a larger city might be more desirable. Thus Hoffman made this purchase more or less as a temporary experiment. Justice does not require that the damages awarded him, because of selling <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page725" class="pagebreak">725</span>these assets at the behest of defendants, should exceed any actual loss sustained measured by the difference between the sales price and the fair market value.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the evidence does not sustain the large award of damages arising from the sale of the Wautoma grocery business, the trial court properly ordered a new trial on this issue.</p>
<p id="sec360" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Did Red Owl Stores ever promise Hoffman anything? What?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. When the deal began to go sour before any final contract was executed, Red Owl and its lawyers probably were in substantial doubt whether they were exposed to any liability to Hoffman. What, if anything, might they have done at that point to limit their potential liability? Was there any way Red Owl could call the deal off once it began to talk to Hoffman and once he began to take it seriously?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. If Hoffman had withdrawn from the transaction at the last minute, would Red Owl have a good cause of action? What would be the basis, and what would be the remedy?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. The court holds that the evidence does not sustain the jury verdict of $20,000 damages made to Hoffman. On remand, what damages should the trial court award? Who really won on appeal—Hoffman or Red Owl?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Franchising, the marketing of goods through independent outlets under a common trademark and common business methods, has become of great economic significance throughout the world. Typically, the franchisee, like Hoffman, must make a substantial personal and financial investment in the franchise. Often he depends on the expertise and representations of the franchisor, who is supposed to know all about the business and be in a position to advise the potential franchisee which location is ideal for, say, a Red Owl market. Most franchisors are sophisticated business enterprises; many franchisees are small, independent, family-run businesses. The franchisor usually has great power over the franchisee and his operation, with continuing control over the trademark, the use of which is essential to the business. The franchisor usually retains broad powers to ensure that the franchisee maintains its standards, including the power to terminate the franchise if the franchisee does not toe the mark. The franchisee typically bears the risk of financial loss if the franchisor’s rosy predictions of potential business are not borne out in experience.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike some other legal systems which long have provided indemnity for terminated franchisees and other protections, our contract law has tended not to constrain the strategic and economic power of the franchisor. This has produced a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page726" class="pagebreak">726</span>variety of reactions, including legislation and Federal Trade Commission administrative rules that seek to control franchising practices and protect franchisees. Recall <span class="italic">Postal Instant Press v. Sealy</span>, p. 170 and notes following. <span class="italic">Hoffman v. Red Owl</span> is an example of the imaginative use of common law methods towards a similar end. What other theories might the court have drawn upon to protect Hoffman’s reliance on what Red Owl told him? Was Red Owl’s behavior a tort? Did Red Owl make misrepresentations? Did Red Owl occupy a position of trust vis-à-vis Hoffman placing it under a special duty to protect him from loss?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. <span class="italic">Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores,</span> has drawn a large amount of scholarly attention over the years as a kind of high-water mark for the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and it continues to be controversial. Professor Robert Scott suggests that the case was wrongly decided, is an outlier, and is not generally followed. To explain the contrary jury’s verdict, he suggests that Red Owl failed to adequately raise three important issues at trial: (1) Whether Lukowitz’s authority to make the financial representation that $18,000 would be sufficient was limited to the sale of the grocery business and the purchase of the option in Chilton; (2) Whether Hoffman’s reliance should have been measured by the standard of a reasonable person rather than from the perspective of someone of Hoffman’s limited education, business experience and acumen; and (3) Whether Hoffman was conflating the amount of equity and amount of cash Red Owl was demanding. <span class="italic">See</span> Robert E. Scott, Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores <span class="italic">and the Myth of Precontractual Reliance</span>, 68 O<small>HIO</small> S<small>T</small>. L.J. 71 (2007). Conversely, Professors William Whitford and Stewart Macaulay while acknowledging Professor Scott’s arguments, conclude, based on their own interview of Joe Hoffman, that the case was correctly decided. They emphasize that at the first meeting over the proposed financial plan, two people in addition to Hoffman and Lukowitz were present. These two men were Red Owl officials who worked full time on the development of new stores and they assured Hoffman during the planning seemed sufficient and that building should commence soon. Given this context, Whitford and Macaulay believe that the jury reasonably found Lukowitz’s statements to be a promise upon which Hoffman reasonably relied on to his detriment. <span class="italic">See</span> William C. Whitford &amp; Stewart Macaulay, Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores<span class="italic">: The Rest of the Story</span>, 61 H<small>ASTINGS</small> L.J. 801 (2010).</p>

He lost in the trial court, and the Supreme Court of California affirmed on appeal because, on the face of his new complaint, his restated claim was barred by <span class="italic">laches</span> (an equitable defense arising out of undue delay in asserting a claim), and—if the former suit could be considered by the court to avoid the <span class="italic">laches</span> defense—the judgment therein set up the bar of <span class="italic">res judicata</span>.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-139" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_139" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>.  Out of pocket damages are particularly appropriate where, as may be the case here, the plaintiff cannot rationally calculate the benefit of the bargain. It is difficult to make this calculation rationally unless one can say that the defendant’s failure to follow through on a promise is a but for cause of the loss of profits. Here, Arcadian’s alleged failure to bargain in good faith is not a but for cause of API’s lost profits, since even with the best faith on both sides the deal might not have been closed. Because attributing API’s lost profits to Arcadian’s bad faith may be speculative at best, the district court may decide that damages based on API’s out of pocket costs are most appropriate.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-140" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_140" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>.  The district court justified its decision by saying, “A claim for promissory estoppel under New York law must fall where the ‘negotiations of the parties as reflected in the draft agreements made it clear that the obligations of both [were] contingent upon execution and delivery of formal contract documents.’’’ But the district court conflated Arcadian’s substantive obligation with its obligation to bargain in good faith. Unlike Arcadian’s substantive obligations, its obligation to bargain in good faith was obviously intended to begin immediately. The good faith obligation cannot, therefore, be said to be contingent upon formal contract documents.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-141" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_141" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a>.  Dain Bosworth and counsel for Medtronic were of the opinion that the termination fee provision in the St. Jude merger was invalid and unenforceable. Medtronic wanted Electromedics to accept its offer, terminate the St. Jude merger agreement, and refuse to pay the termination fee because it was invalid. Electromedics perceived this as an agreement to breach another agreement and refused nonpayment of the termination fee. As a compromise, Medtronic agreed to deposit $3 million into an escrow account to fund any liability for the termination fee under the St. Jude agreement.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-142" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/18_chapter07.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_142" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>.  We note that despite this argument renouncing termination fees, the Electromedics/Medtronic’s merger agreement contained a $2 million termination fee provision identical to the provision at issue here. The termination fee, originally $3 million, had been reduced to $2 million when Medtronic increased its bid to $6.875 per share and put $3 million in escrow to cover the possible termination fee to St. Jude at issue in this case.</p>
