<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-102. Scope of Article.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">This article applies to a transaction to the extent that it is governed by another article of this Act.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-103. Construction of this Act to Promote its Purposes and Policies; Applicability of Supplemental Principles of Law.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) This Act must be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies, which are:</p>
<p class="app_list1">(1)   to simplify, clarify, and modernize the law governing commercial transactions;</p>
<p class="app_list1">(2)   to permit the continued expansion of commercial practices through custom, usage, and agreement of the parties; and</p>
<p class="app_list1">(3)   to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, and other validating or invalidating cause supplement its provisions.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page962" class="pagebreak">962</div>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-106. Use of Singular and Plural; Gender.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">In this Act, unless the statutory context otherwise requires:</p>
<p class="app_list">(1) words in the singular number include the plural, and those in the plural include the singular; and</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) words of any gender also refer to any other gender.</p>
<p class="app_cen1">PART 2.<br />GENERAL DEFINITIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-201. General Definitions.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) Unless the context otherwise requires, words or phrases defined in this section, or in the additional definitions contained in other articles of this Act that apply to particular articles or parts thereof, have the meanings stated.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) Subject to definitions contained in other articles of this Act that apply to particular articles or parts thereof:</p>
<p class="app_list1">(1)   “Action”, in the sense of a judicial proceeding, includes recoupment, counterclaim, set-off, suit in equity, and any other proceeding in which rights are determined.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(2)   “Aggrieved party” means a party entitled to pursue a remedy.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(3)   “Agreement”, as distinguished from “contract”, means the bargain of the parties in fact, as found in their language of inferred from other circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade as provided in Section 1-303.</p>

A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person comports with the usual or customary practices in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller’s own usual or customary practices. A person that sells oil, gas, or other minerals at the wellhead or minehead is a person in the business of selling goods of that kind. A buyer in ordinary course of business may buy for cash, by exchange of other property, or on secured or unsecured credit, and may acquire goods or documents of title under preexisting contract for sale. Only a buyer that takes possession of the goods or has a right to recover the goods from the seller under Article 2 may be a buyer in ordinary course of business. “Buyer in ordinary course of business” does not include a person that acquires goods in a transfer in bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(10) “Conspicuous”, with reference to a term, means so written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it. Whether a term is “conspicuous” or is not is a decision for the court. Conspicuous terms include the following:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page963" class="pagebreak">963</div>
<p class="app_list2">(A) a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size; and</p>
<p class="app_list2">(B) language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(11) “Consumer” means an individual who enters into a transaction primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(12) “Contract”, as distinguished from “agreement”, means the total legal obligation that results from the parties’ agreement as determined by this Act as supplemented by any other applicable laws.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(17) “Fault” means a default, breach, or wrongful act or omission.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(18) “Fungible goods” means:</p>
<p class="app_list2">(A) goods of which any unit, by nature or usage of trade, is the equivalent of any other like unit; or</p>
<p class="app_list2">(B) goods that by agreement are treated as equivalent.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(19) “Genuine” means free of forgery or counterfeiting.</p>

<p class="app_list2">(C) being insolvent within the meaning of federal bankruptcy law.</p>

<p class="app_list1">(25) “Organization” means a person other than an individual.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(27) “Person” means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, public corporation, or any other legal or commercial entity.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(32) “Remedy” means any remedial right to which an aggrieved party is entitled with or without resort to a tribunal.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(33) “Representative” means a person empowered to act for another, including an agent, an officer or a corporation or association, and a trustee, executor, or administrator of an estate.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(34) “Right” includes remedy.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(35) “Security interest” means an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation. “Security interest” includes any interest of a consignor and a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, a payment <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page964" class="pagebreak">964</span>intangible, or a promissory note in a transaction that is subject to Article 9. “Security interest” does not include the special property interest of a buyer of goods on identification of those goods to a contract for sale under Section 2-401, but a buyer may also acquire a “security interest” by complying with Article 9. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2-505, the right of a seller or lessor of goods under Article 2 or 2A to retain or acquire possession of the goods is not a “security interest”, but a seller or lessor may also acquire a “security interest” by complying with Article 9. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under Section 2-401 is limited in effect to a reservation of a “security interest.” Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a “security interest” is determined pursuant to Section 1-203.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(36) “Send” in connection with a writing, record, or notice means:</p>
<p class="app_list2">(A) to deposit in the mail or deliver for transmission by any other usual means of communication with postage or cost of transmission provided for and properly addressed and, in the case of an instrument, to an address specified thereon or otherwise agreed, or if there be none to any address reasonable under the circumstances; or</p>
<p class="app_list2">(B) in any other way to cause to be received any record or notice within the time it would have arrived if properly sent.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(37) “Signed” includes any symbol executed or adopted with present intention to adopt or accept a writing.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(39) “Surety” includes a guarantor or other secondary obligor.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(40) “Term” means a portion of an agreement that relates to a particular matter.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(41) “Unauthorized signature” means a signature made without actual, implied, or apparent authority. The term includes a forgery.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(42) “Warehouse receipt” means a receipt issued by a person engaged in the business of storing goods for hire.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(43) “Writing” includes printing, typewriting, or any other intentional reduction to tangible form. “Written” has a corresponding meaning.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-202. Notice; Knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) Subject to subsection (f), a person has “notice” of a fact if the person:</p>
<p class="app_list1">(1)   has actual knowledge of it;</p>
<p class="app_list1">(2)   has received a notice or notification of it; or</p>
<p class="app_list1">(3)   from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that is exists.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) “Knowledge” means actual knowledge. “Knows” has a corresponding meaning.</p>
<p class="app_list">(c) “Discover”, “learn”, or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than to reason to know.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page965" class="pagebreak">965</div>
<p class="app_list">(d) A person “notifies” or “gives” a notice or notification to another person by taking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.</p>
<p class="app_list">(e) Subject to subsection (f), a person “receives” a notice or notification when:</p>
<p class="app_list1">(1)   it comes to that person’s attention; or</p>
<p class="app_list1">(2)   it is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of its communications</p>
<p class="app_list">(f) Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual’s attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-204. Value.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">Except as otherwise provided in Articles 3, 4, 5, and 6, a person gives value for rights if the person acquires them:</p>
<p class="app_list">(1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit, whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a chargeback is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection;</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) as security for, or in total or partial satisfaction of, a preexisting claim;</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) by accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase; or</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-205. Reasonable Time; Seasonableness.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) Whether a time for taking an action required by this Act is reasonable depends on the nature, purpose, and circumstances of the action.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) An action is taken seasonably if it is taken at or within the time agreed or, if no time is agreed, at or within a reasonable time.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page966" class="pagebreak">966</div>
<p class="app_cen1">PART 3<br />TERRITORIAL APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL; RULES</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-302. Variation by Agreement.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) or elsewhere in this Act, the effect of provisions of this Act may be varied by agreement.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care prescribed by this Act may not be disclaimed by agreement. The parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable. Whenever this Act requires an action to be taken within a reasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement.</p>
<p class="app_list">(c) The presence in certain provisions of this Act of the phrase “unless otherwise agreed”, or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be varied by agreement under this section.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) A “course of performance” is a sequence of conduct between parties to a particular transaction that exists if:</p>
<p class="app_list1">(1)   the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and</p>
<p class="app_list1">(2)   the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) A “course of dealing” is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.</p>
<p class="app_list">(c) A “usage of trade” is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.</p>
<p class="app_list">(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties’ agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.</p>
<p class="app_list">(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page967" class="pagebreak">967</span>be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable:</p>
<p class="app_list1">(1)   express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;</p>
<p class="app_list1">(2)   course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and</p>
<p class="app_list1">(3)   course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.</p>
<p class="app_list">(f) Subject to Section 2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.</p>
<p class="app_list">(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">Every contract or duty within this Act implies an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-305. Remedies to be Liberally Administered.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) The remedies provided by this Act must be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed but neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in this Act or by other rule of law.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) Any right or obligation declared by this Act is enforceable by action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in an authenticated record.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(a) A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved. Such words as “without prejudice”, “under protest”, or the like are sufficient.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) Subsection (a) does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.</p>

<p class="app_cen">ARTICLE 2—SALES<br />2000 OFFICIAL TEXT</p>
<p class="app_cen1">PART 1<br />SHORT TITLE, GENERAL CONSTRUCTION AND SUBJECT MATTER</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–101. Short Title.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">This Article shall be known and may be cited as Uniform Commercial Code—Sales.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–102. Scope; Certain Security and Other Transactions Excluded From This Article.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">Unless the context otherwise requires, this Article applies to transactions in goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a security transaction nor does this Article impair or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–103. Definitions and Index of Definitions.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires</p>
<p class="app_list1">(a) “Buyer” means a person who buys or contracts to buy goods.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(b) “Good faith” in the case of a merchant means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(c) “Receipt” of goods means taking physical possession of them.</p>
<p class="app_list1">(d) “Seller” means a person who sells or contracts to sell goods….</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–104. Definitions: “Merchant”; “Between Merchants”; “Financing Agency.”</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) “Merchant” means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill….</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) “Between merchants” means in any transaction with respect to which both parties are chargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–105. Definitions: Transferability; “Goods”; “Future” Goods; “Lot”; “Commercial Unit.”</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) “Goods” means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and things in action. “Goods” also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (Section 2–107).</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page969" class="pagebreak">969</div>
<p class="app_list">(2) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are “future” goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller’s interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common.</p>
<p class="app_list">(5) “Lot” means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract.</p>
<p class="app_list">(6) “Commercial unit” means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–106. Definitions: “Contract”; “Agreement”; “Contract for Sale”; “Sale”; “Present Sale”; “Conforming” to Contract; “Termination”; “Cancellation.”</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires “contract” and “agreement” are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. “Contract for sale” includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A “sale” consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2–401). A “present sale” means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are “conforming” or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) “Termination” occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On “termination” all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives….</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) “Cancellation” occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of “termination” except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page970" class="pagebreak">970</div>
<p class="app_cen1">PART 2<br />FORM, FORMATION AND READJUSTMENT OF CONTRACT</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–201. Formal Requirements; Statute of Frauds.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within 10 days after it is received.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller’s business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (Sec. 2–606).</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–202. Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented</p>
<p class="app_list">(a) by course of dealing or usage of trade (Section 1–303); and</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page971" class="pagebreak">971</div>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–203. Seals Inoperative.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a contract for sale or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–204. Formation in General.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–205. Firm Offers.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–206. Offer and Acceptance in Formation of Contract.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances;</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods, but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–207. Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page972" class="pagebreak">972</div>
<p class="app_list">(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) they materially alter it; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–208. Course of Performance or Practical Construction.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) The express terms of the agreement and any such course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable, express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealing and usage of trade (Section 1–205).</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Subject to the provisions of the next section on modification and waiver, such course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–209. Modification, Rescission and Waiver.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) An agreement modifying a contract within this Article needs no consideration to be binding.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article (Section 2–201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.</p>
<p class="app_list">(5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page973" class="pagebreak">973</div>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-406, unless otherwise agreed, all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor’s due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the seller’s interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer’s chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remains effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of “the contract” is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor’s performance.</p>
<p class="app_list">(5) An assignment of “the contract” or of “all my rights under the contract” or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.</p>
<p class="app_list">(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Section 2-609).</p>

<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–302. Unconscionable Contract or Clause.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–305. Open Price Term.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) nothing is said as to price; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–306. Output, Requirements and Exclusive Dealings.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page975" class="pagebreak">975</div>
<p class="app_list">(2) A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.</p>

<p class="app_list">Unless otherwise agreed all goods called for by a contract for sale must be tendered in a single delivery and payment is due only on such tender but where the circumstances give either party the right to make or demand delivery in lots the price if it can be apportioned may be demanded for each lot.</p>

<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–309. Absence of Specific Time Provisions; Notice of Termination.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) The time for shipment or delivery or any other action under a contract if not provided in this Article or agreed upon shall be a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Where the contract provides for successive performances but is indefinite in duration it is valid for a reasonable time but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Termination of a contract by one party except on the happening of an agreed event requires that reasonable notification be received by the other party and an agreement dispensing with notification is invalid if its operation would be unconscionable.</p>

<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–311. Options and Cooperation Respecting Performance.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) An agreement for sale which is otherwise sufficiently definite (subsection (3) of Section 2–204) to be a contract is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties. Any such specification must be made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Unless otherwise agreed specifications relating to assortment of the goods are at the buyer’s option and except as otherwise provided in subsections (1)(c) and (3) of Section 2–319 specifications or arrangements relating to shipment are at the seller’s option.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Where such specification would materially affect the other party’s performance but is not seasonably made or where one party’s cooperation is necessary to the agreed performance of the other but is not seasonably forthcoming, the other party in addition to all other remedies</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) is excused for any resulting delay in his own performance; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) may also either proceed to perform in any reasonable manner or after the time for a material part of his own performance treat the failure to specify or to cooperate as a breach by failure to deliver or accept the goods.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–312. Warranty of Title and Against Infringement; Buyer’s Obligation Against Infringement.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Subject to subsection (2) there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) the title conveyed shall be good, and its transfer rightful; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) the goods shall be delivered free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) A warranty under subsection (1) will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–313. Express Warranties by Affirmation, Promise, Description, Sample.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page977" class="pagebreak">977</div>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as “warrant” or “guarantee” or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller’s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–314. Implied Warranty: Merchantability; Usage of Trade.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2–316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; and</p>

<p class="app_list1a">(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(f) conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2–316) other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.</p>

<p class="app_list">Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (Section 2–202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page978" class="pagebreak">978</span>writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that “There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.”</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like “as is”, “with all faults” or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer’s attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with the provisions of this Article on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual modification of remedy (Sections 2–718 and 2–719).</p>

<p class="app_list">Warranties whether express or implied shall be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if such construction is unreasonable the intention of the parties shall determine which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description.</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description.</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–318. Third Party Beneficiaries of Warranties Express or Implied.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">A seller’s warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.</p>

<p class="app_list1a">(b) when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provided in this Article (Section 2-503);</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this Article on the form of bill of lading (Section 2-323).</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means “free alongside") at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which the seller must</p>

<p class="app_list1a">(b) obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the carrier is under a duty to issue a bill of lading.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within subsection (1)(a) or (c) or subsection (2) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of the vessel and in an appropriate case its name and sailing date. The seller may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation under this Article (Section 2-311). He may also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipment.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–320. C.I.F. and C. &amp; F. Terms.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) The term C.I.F. means that the price includes in a lump sum the cost of the goods and the insurance and freight to the named destination. The term C. &amp; F. or C.F. means that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Unless otherwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the seller at his own expense and risk to</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page980" class="pagebreak">980</span>bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and</p>

<p class="app_list">(3) Unless otherwise agreed the term C. &amp; F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Under the term C.I.F. or C. &amp; F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–328. Sale by Auction.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the subject of a separate sale.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer’s announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder’s retraction does not revive any previous bid.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller’s behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to any bid at a forced sale.</p>

<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–501. Insurable Interest in Goods; Manner of Identification of Goods.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are non-conforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page981" class="pagebreak">981</span>identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph (c), when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) when the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal harvest season after contracting whichever is longer.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–503. Manner of Seller’s Tender of Delivery.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer’s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this Article, and in particular</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but</p>

<p class="app_list">(2) Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section….</p>

<p class="app_list">(1) Tender of delivery is a condition to the buyer’s duty to accept the goods and, unless otherwise agreed, to his duty to pay for them. Tender entitles the seller to acceptance of the goods and to payment according to the contract.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Where payment is due and demanded on the delivery to the buyer of goods or documents of title, his right as against the seller to retain or dispose of them is conditional upon his making the payment due.</p>

<p class="app_list">(1) Where any tender or delivery by the seller is rejected because non-conforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a conforming delivery.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Where the buyer rejects a non-conforming tender which the seller had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender.</p>

<p class="app_list">(1) Unless otherwise agreed tender of payment is a condition to the seller’s duty to tender and complete any delivery.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Tender of payment is sufficient when made by any means or in any manner current in the ordinary course of business unless the seller demands payment in legal tender and gives any extension of time reasonably necessary to procure it.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act on the effect of an instrument on an obligation (Section 3–310), payment by check is conditional and is defeated as between the parties by dishonor of the check on due presentment.</p>

<p class="app_list">(1) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. When the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Expenses of inspection must be borne by the buyer but may be recovered from the seller if the goods do not conform and are rejected.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this Article on C.I.F. contracts (subsection (3) of Section 2–321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods before payment of the price when the contract provides</p>

<p class="app_list">(4) A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract.</p>

<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–601. Buyer’s Rights on Improper Delivery.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">Subject to the provisions of this Article on breach in installment contracts (Section 2–612) and unless otherwise agreed under the sections on contractual limitations of remedy (Sections 2–718 and 2–719), if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the contract, the buyer may</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) reject the whole; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) accept the whole; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–602. Manner and Effect of Rightful Rejection.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. It is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Subject to the provisions of the two following sections on rejected goods (Sections 2–603 and 2–604),</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) after rejection any exercise of ownership by the buyer with respect to any commercial unit is wrongful as against the seller; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) if the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this Article (subsection (3) of Section 2–711), he is under a duty after rejection to hold them with reasonable care at the seller’s disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them; but</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) the buyer has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) The seller’s rights with respect to goods wrongfully rejected are governed by the provisions of this Article on Seller’s remedies in general (Section 2–703).</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–605. Waiver of Buyer’s Objections by Failure to Particularize.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) The buyer’s failure to state in connection with rejection a particular defect which is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes him from relying on the unstated defect to justify rejection or to establish breach</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) where the seller could have cured it if stated seasonably; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) between merchants when the seller has after rejection made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the buyer proposes to rely.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Payment against documents made without reservation of rights precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent on the face of the documents.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page984" class="pagebreak">984</div>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–606. What Constitutes Acceptance of Goods.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) after a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will take or retain them in spite of their non-conformity; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) fails to make an effective rejection (subsection (1) of Section 2–602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) does any act inconsistent with the seller’s ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–607. Effect of Acceptance; Notice of Breach; Burden of Establishing Breach After Acceptance; Notice of Claim or Litigation to Person Answerable Over.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a non-conformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the non-conformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this Article for non-conformity.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Where a tender has been accepted</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; …</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–608. Revocation of Acceptance in Whole or in Part.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose non-conformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) on the reasonable assumption that its non-conformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) without discovery of such non-conformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller’s assurances.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–609. Right to Adequate Assurance of Performance.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other’s expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page985" class="pagebreak">985</span>writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party’s right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–610. Anticipatory Repudiation.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">When either party repudiates the contract with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) for a commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating party; or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) resort to any remedy for breach (Section 2–703 or Section 2–711), even though he has notified the repudiating party that he would await the latter’s performance and has urged retraction; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(c) in either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this Article on the seller’s right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (Section 2–704).</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–611. Retraction of Anticipatory Repudiation.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Until the repudiating party’s next performance is due he can retract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this Article (Section 2–609).</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Retraction reinstates the repudiating party’s rights under the contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–612. “Installment Contract”; Breach.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) An “installment contract” is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause “each delivery is a separate contract” or its equivalent.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) The buyer may reject any installment which is non-conforming if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the non-conformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the non-conformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page986" class="pagebreak">986</div>
<p class="app_list">(3) Whenever non-conformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-conforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–613. Casualty to Identified Goods.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">Where the contract requires for its performance goods identified when the contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of either party before the risk of loss passes to the buyer, or in a proper case under a “no arrival, no sale” term (Section 2–324) then</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) if the loss is total the contract is avoided; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract the buyer may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the contract as avoided or accept the goods with due allowance from the contract price for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the seller.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–614. Substituted Performance.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, such substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer provides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the buyer’s obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–615. Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to the preceding section on substituted performance:</p>
<p class="app_list">(a) Delay in delivery or non-delivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid.</p>
<p class="app_list">(b) Where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only a part of the seller’s capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contract <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page987" class="pagebreak">987</span>as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p class="app_list">(c) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or non-delivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–616. Procedure on Notice Claiming Excuse.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Where the buyer receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allocation justified under the preceding section he may by written notification to the seller as to any delivery concerned, and where the prospective deficiency substantially impairs the value of the whole contract under the provisions of this Article relating to breach of installment contracts (Section 2–612), then also as to the whole,</p>

<p class="app_list1a">(b) treat as the subject of resale goods which have demonstrably been intended for the particular contract even though those goods are unfinished.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Where the goods are unfinished an aggrieved seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realization either complete the manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the contract or cease manufacture and resell for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner.</p>

<p class="app_list">(1) Under the conditions stated in Section 2–703 on seller’s remedies, the seller may resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of this Article (Section 2–710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer’s breach.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Where the resale is at public sale</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and</p>

<p class="app_list">(5) A purchaser who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the seller fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="app_list">(6) The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A person in the position of a seller (Section 2–707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security interest, as hereinafter defined (subsection (3) of Section 2–711).</p>

<p class="app_list">(1) Subject to subsection (2) and to the provisions of this Article with respect to proof of market price (Section 2–723), the measure of damages for non-acceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in this Article (Section 2–710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer’s breach.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this Article (Section 2–710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.</p>

<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–718. Liquidation or Limitation of Damages; Deposits.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Where the seller justifiably withholds delivery of goods because of the buyer’s breach, the buyer is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) the amount to which the seller is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the seller’s damages in accordance with subsection (1), or</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) in the absence of such terms, twenty per cent of the value of the total performance for which the buyer is obligated under the contract or $500, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) The buyer’s right to restitution under subsection (2) is subject to offset to the extent that the seller establishes</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) a right to recover damages under the provisions of this Article other than subsection (1), and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) the amount or value of any benefits received by the buyer directly or indirectly by reason of the contract.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) Where a seller has received payment in goods their reasonable value or the proceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection (2); but if the seller has notice of the buyer’s breach before reselling goods received in part performance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this Article on resale by an aggrieved seller (Section 2–706).</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–719. Contractual Modification or Limitation of Remedy.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section and of the preceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages,</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(a) the agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this Article, as by limiting the buyer’s remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of non-conforming goods or parts; and</p>
<p class="app_list1a">(b) resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Act.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.</p>

<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–721. Remedies for Fraud.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">Remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under this Article for non-fraudulent breach. Neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale nor rejection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other remedy.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–723. Proof of Market Price: Time and Place.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price (Section 2–708 or Section 2–713) shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) If evidence of a price prevailing at the times or places described in this Article is not readily available the price prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the cost of transporting the goods to or from such other place.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Evidence of a relevant price prevailing at a time or place other than the one described in this Article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party such notice as the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–724. Admissibility of Market Quotations.</span></p>
<p class="app_noindent">Whenever the prevailing price or value of any goods regularly bought and sold in any established commodity market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of such market shall be admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of such a report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.</p>
<p class="app_sec"><span class="italic">§ 2–725. Statute of Limitations in Contracts for Sale.</span></p>
<p class="app_list">(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.</p>
<p class="app_list">(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party’s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.</p>
<p class="app_list">(3) Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page994" class="pagebreak">994</span>six months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.</p>
<p class="app_list">(4) This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action which have accrued before this Act becomes effective.</p>
