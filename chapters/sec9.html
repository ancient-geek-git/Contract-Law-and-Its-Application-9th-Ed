<p class="indent">Up to this point, we have examined the effect of an agreement on the legal relations between the persons who made it. This Chapter examines the problems that arise when the community of the agreement expands to include or otherwise affect others.</p>
<p class="indent">Contracting parties create a special legal status for themselves: They invoke the law to lend force to <span class="bold"><span class="italic">their</span></span> claims. The first two topics of this Chapter examine the traditional legal rights and obligations arising out of a contract with respect to two types of nonparties. We shall be looking at two interrelated questions: (a) who, besides parties to a contract, can claim its benefits and enforce its obligations; and (b) when can the benefits and burdens of contractual obligation be transferred from a contracting party to a third person. The first issue is labeled “rights of third-party beneficiaries,” and the second usually discussed under the heading “assignment of contract.” The final topic in this Chapter will examine how the existence of a contract may create obligations on nonparties to respect it.</p>
<p class="indent">Much of contract law is grounded on unrealistically individualistic assumptions about human interactions. Contracting parties are treated as if the contract is exclusively their private concern and as if society exists solely to support and enforce their autonomous undertakings. In fact, complex societies are extremely and persistently interdependent, and that interdependency and the relationships that arise out of it are both related to and independent of particular contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">The performance of an agreement to supply a manufacturer with raw materials will determine the price, availability and quality of its product to its customers and ultimately to individual consumers. It also will affect the manufacturer’s workers, the truckers that carry its goods to market, and the retailers that sell goods to individuals, including perhaps the manufacturer’s own workers and those of its supplier. Breach of the agreement will affect not only the immediate parties to the agreement, but a whole community of persons, some of whose vital interests will be at stake. We usually think of the contract as an exercise of private autonomy, as the creature of the parties who made it. To what extent does the law also recognize that the contract “belongs” to a larger community?</p>
<p class="indent">The issues discussed in this Chapter are vital to the usefulness of contract in a modern economy. By recognizing the rights of third-party beneficiaries, the ambit of private lawmaking is enlarged. Enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page878" class="pagebreak">878</span>consumer warranties, and creditor rights all depend on this. And when the law allows contracts to be freely assigned to third parties, it converts contract from a personal promise to a commodity that may be traded in the market.</p>
<p class="indent">Note the interaction between jurisprudential rationales for legal doctrine and social and economic factors. For example, the difficulties the law had in accepting the transferability of intangible contract rights could be understood as a purely conceptual hang-up of a simpler age based on the “strictly personal” nature of the relationship between contracting parties. But you will miss the most important lessons to be learned if you stop there without examining the social and economic effects of this doctrine at the time it developed. The doctrine loses its air of arid scholasticism when you consider it in the light of a 17<sup>th</sup> century decision by Lord Coke suggesting that the non-assignability of intangibles prevents the social and economic positions of landed gentry and nobles from passing to their creditors by assignment. Viewed in this light, we can follow Professor Gilmore’s suggestion that “the results Coke feared were perhaps of the same order as those which have prompted modern legislation prohibiting or restricting the assignment of wage claims.” G<small>RANT</small> G<small>ILMORE</small>, S<small>ECURITY</small> I<small>NTERESTS IN</small> P<small>ERSONAL</small> P<small>ROPERTY</small> § 7.3 (1965).</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">Does the benefit of a contract inhere only in the parties, or may others generally claim damages by showing an interest in performance or injury by a breach? The answer, of course, lies between these two extremes. Long before the modern law of contract developed, the common law enforced a variety of agreements made for the benefit of a third party. For example, the courts very early recognized that the beneficiary of a trust can legally enforce the trustee’s obligations, although the beneficiary is not a party to the transaction creating the trust. Similarly, the relationship of principal and agent was developed at an early stage to the point where persons doing business with the agent, but having no direct contact with his principal, could enforce obligations against the principal.</p>
<p class="indent">The difficulty with third-party beneficiary rights in contract arose in the 19<sup>th</sup> century as the concept of consideration rigidified into hard doctrine. Enforcement by the beneficiary would be challenged on the ground that there was “no mutuality of obligation,” citing the English doctrine of that time that consideration must be given by the plaintiff who seeks to enforce the promise. Sometimes this requirement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page879" class="pagebreak">879</span>would be characterized as conditioning enforcement on showing “privity of contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">Under this rigid approach, the practical result was that a contracting party could be quite sure that its legal liability under the agreement was limited to claims by the other contracting parties. It was relatively secure from finding itself in a position where it had to answer to “strangers” for the adequacy of its performance. Creation of a third-party relationship expands the community of the contract by admitting a new party to it. It does not displace the relationship between the original parties; they remain tied to each other and add the new party to their group.</p>

<p id="sec454" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Lawrence v. Fox</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1859.</p>
<p class="sectionb">20 N.Y. 268.</p>
<p class="indent">Appeal from the Superior Court of the City of Buffalo. On the trial before Mr. Justice Masten, it appeared by the evidence of a by-stander that one Holly in November, 1857, at the request of the defendant, loaned and advanced to him $300, stating at the time that he owed that sum to the plaintiff for money borrowed of him, and had agreed to pay it to him the then next day; that the defendant, in consideration thereof, at the time of receiving the money promised to pay it to the plaintiff the then next day. Upon this state of facts the defendant moved for a nonsuit, upon three several grounds, viz.: That there was no proof tending to show that Holly was indebted to the plaintiff, that the agreement by the defendant with Holly to pay the plaintiff was void for want of consideration, and that there was no privity between the plaintiff and defendant. The court overruled the motion, and the counsel for the defendant excepted. The cause was then submitted to the jury, and they found a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the loan and interest, $344.66, upon which judgment was entered, from which the defendant appealed to the Superior Court, at General Term, where the judgment was affirmed, and the defendant appealed to this court. The cause was submitted on printed arguments.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ H. G<small>RAY</small>, J. …</p>
<p class="indent">[It] is claimed that notwithstanding this promise was established by competent evidence, it was void for the want of consideration. It is now more than a quarter of a century since it was settled by the supreme court of this state—in an able and painstaking opinion by the late Chief Justice Savage, in which the authorities were fully examined and carefully analyzed—that a promise in all material respects like <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page880" class="pagebreak">880</span>the one under consideration was valid; and the judgment of that court was unanimously affirmed by the court for the correction of errors. Farley v. Cleveland, 4 Cow. 432, 15 Am.Dec. 387; s.c. in error, 9 Cow. 639. In that case one Moon owed Farley and sold to Cleveland a quantity of hay, in consideration of which Cleveland promised to pay Moon’s debt to Farley; and the decision in favor of Farley’s right to recover was placed upon the ground that the hay received by Cleveland from Moon was a valid consideration for Cleveland’s promise to pay Farley, and that the subsisting liability of Moon to pay Farley was no objection to the recovery. The fact that the money advanced by Holly to the defendant was a loan to him for a day, and that it thereby became the property of the defendant, seemed to impress the defendant’s counsel with the idea that because the defendant’s promise was not a trust fund placed by the plaintiff in the defendant’s hands, out of which he was to realize money as from the sale of a chattel or the collection of a debt, the promise although made for the benefit of the plaintiff could not inure to his benefit. The hay which Cleveland bought of Moon was not to be paid to Farley, but the debt incurred by Cleveland for the purchase of the hay, like the debt incurred by the defendant for money borrowed, was what was to be paid.</p>
<p class="indent">That case has been often referred to by the courts of this state, and has never been doubted as sound authority for the principle upheld by it. It puts to rest the objection that the defendant’s promise was void for want of consideration. The report of that case shows that the promise was not only made to Moon but to the plaintiff Farley. In this case the promise was made to Holly and not expressly to the plaintiff; and this difference between the two cases presents the question, raised by the defendant’s objection, as to the want of privity between the plaintiff and defendant. As early as 1806 it was announced by the supreme court of this state, upon what was then regarded as the settled law of England, “That where one person makes a promise to another for the benefit of a third person, that third person may maintain an action upon it.” <span class="italic">Schemerhorn v. Vanderheyden</span>, has often been reasserted by our courts and never departed from….</p>
<p class="indent">But it is urged that because the defendant was not in any sense a trustee of the property of Holly for the benefit of the plaintiff, the law will not imply a promise. I agree that many of the cases where a promise was implied were cases of trusts, created for the benefit of the promisor. The case of <span class="italic">Felton v. Dickinson</span>, and others that might be cited are of that class; but concede them all to have been cases of trusts, and it proves nothing against the application of the rule of this case. The duty of the trustee to pay the cestui que trust, according to the terms of the trust, implies his promise to the latter to do so. In this case the defendant, upon ample consideration received from Holly, promised Holly to pay his debt to the plaintiff; the consideration received and the promise to Holly made it as plainly his duty to pay the plaintiff as if the money had been remitted to him for that purpose, and as well implied a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page881" class="pagebreak">881</span>promise to do so as if he had been made a trustee of property to be converted into cash with which to pay. The fact that a breach of the duty imposed in the one case may be visited, and justly, with more serious consequences than in the other, by no means disproves the payment to be a duty in both. The principle illustrated by the example so frequently quoted (which concisely states the case in hand) “that a promise made to one for the benefit of another, he for whose benefit it is made may bring an action for its breach,” has been applied to trust cases, not because it was exclusively applicable to those cases, but because it was a principle of law, and as such applicable to those cases.</p>
<p class="indent">It was also insisted that Holly could have discharged the defendant from his promise, though it was intended by both parties for the benefit of the plaintiff, and, therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain this suit for the recovery of a demand over which he had no control. It is enough that the plaintiff did not release the defendant from his promise, and whether he could or not is a question not now necessarily involved; but if it was, I think it would be found difficult to maintain the right of Holly to discharge a judgment recovered by the plaintiff upon confession or otherwise, for the breach of the defendant’s promise; and if he could not, how could he discharge the suit before judgment, or the promise before suit, made as it was for the plaintiff’s benefit and in accordance with legal presumption accepted by him, until his dissent was shown?</p>
<p class="indent">The cases cited and especially that of <span class="italic">Farley v. Cleveland</span>, established the validity of a parol promise; it stands then upon the footing of a written one. Suppose the defendant had given his note in which for value received of Holly, he had promised to pay the plaintiff and the plaintiff had accepted the promise, retaining Holly’s liability. Very clearly Holly could not have discharged that promise, be the right to release the defendant as it may. No one can doubt that he owes the sum of money demanded of him, or that in accordance with his promise it was his duty to have paid it to the plaintiff; nor can it be doubted that whatever may be the diversity of opinion elsewhere, the adjudications in this state, from a very early period, approved by experience, have established the defendant’s liability; if, therefore it could be shown that a more strict and technically accurate application of the rules applied, would lead to a different result (which I by no means concede), the effort should not be made in the face of manifest justice.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ J<small>OHNSON</small>, C.J., and D<small>ENIO</small>, J., based their judgment upon the ground that the promise was to be regarded as made to the plaintiff through the medium of his agent, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page882" class="pagebreak">882</span>whose action he could ratify when it came to his knowledge, though taken without his being privy thereto.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>OMSTOCK</small>, J. (dissenting). The plaintiff had nothing to do with the promise on which he brought this action. It was not made to him, nor did the consideration proceed from him. If he can maintain the suit, it is because an anomaly has found its way into the law on this subject. In general, there must be privity of contract. The party who sues upon a promise must be the promisee, or he must have some legal interest in the undertaking. In this case, it is plain that Holly, who loaned the money to the defendant, and to whom the promise in question was made, could at any time have claimed that it should be performed to himself personally. He had lent the money to the defendant, and at the same time directed the latter to pay the sum to the plaintiff. This direction he could countermand, and if he had done so, manifestly the defendant’s promise to pay according to the direction would have ceased to exist. The plaintiff would receive a benefit by a complete execution of the arrangement, but the arrangement itself was between other parties, and was under their exclusive control. If the defendant had paid the money to Holly, his debt would have been discharged thereby. So Holly might have released the demand or assigned it to another person, or the parties might have annulled the promise now in question, and designated some other creditor of Holly as the party to whom the money should be paid. It has never been claimed that in a case thus situated the right of a third person to sue upon the promise rested on any sound principle of law. We are to inquire whether the rule has been so established by positive authority….</p>
<p class="indent">The cases in which some trust was involved are … frequently referred to as authority for the doctrine now in question, but they do not sustain it. If A. delivers money or property to B., which the latter accepts upon a trust for the benefit of C., the latter can enforce the trust by an appropriate action for that purpose. If the trust be of money, I think the beneficiary may assent to it and bring the action for money had and received to his use. If it be of something else than money, the trustee must account for it according to the terms of the trust, and upon principles of equity. There is some authority even for saying that an express promise founded on the possession of a trust fund may be enforced by an action at law in the name of the beneficiary, although it was made to the creator of the trust. Thus, in Comyn, Dig. “Action on the Case upon Assumpsit,” B. 15, it is laid down that if a man promise a pig of lead to A., and his executor give lead to make a pig to B., who assumes to deliver it to A., an assumpsit lies by A. against him. The case of <span class="italic">Delaware &amp; H. Canal Co. v. Westchester County Bank</span> involved a trust because the defendants had received from a third party a bill of exchange under an agreement that they would endeavor to collect it, and would pay over the proceeds when collected to the plaintiffs. A fund received under such an agreement does not belong to the person who receives <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page883" class="pagebreak">883</span>it. He must account for it specifically; and perhaps there is no gross violation of principle in permitting the equitable owner of it to sue upon an express promise to pay it over. Having a specific interest in the thing, the undertaking to account for it may be regarded as in some sense made with him through the author of the trust. But further than this we cannot go without violating plain rules of law. In the case before us there was nothing in the nature of a trust or agency. The defendant borrowed the money of Holly and received it as his own. The plaintiff had no right in the fund, legal or equitable. The promise to repay the money created an obligation in favor of the lender to whom it was made and not in favor of any one else.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment of the court below should, therefore, be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>
<p id="sec455" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What consideration did Fox get from the plaintiff? Was Lawrence a “promisee”? If Fox had promised Holly that he would promise Lawrence to pay Holly’s debt, and he had done so the same day, would there have been “privity” between Lawrence and Fox?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Could Lawrence have sued both Holly and Fox? Could he have recovered against both? Could Holly now sue Fox? For what damages?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Judge Gray treats this problem as a general one of the enforceability of promises, while four of his colleagues consider the issue more appropriately decided in terms of agency or trust concepts. How should a judge decide which legal category applies? Aren’t all agencies and trusts essentially third-party beneficiary situations? Don’t most commercial contract beneficiary situations involve elements resembling agencies and trusts? As we will see later in this Chapter, our tendency to divide problems into conventional categories like contract, tort, and trusts, often causes more trouble than it helps. Given this tendency, how should a lawyer with a problem decide which category the particular problem fits in? Consider the question from the position of advocate, counselor with a client, and judge.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. <span class="italic">Lawrence v. Fox</span> is a classic case in the law. Yet of the eight judges who sat in the New York Court of Appeals on the case, only three joined Judge Gray in his opinion. Of the remaining four, two flatly dissented, and the other two—although joining Gray for affirmance—did so for reasons other than his. What do you think would be the result if you argued to a court that Judge Gray’s opinion is not the law because it is not a statement by a majority of the court?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Professor Anthony Jon Waters has written a comprehensive and provocative review of the historical records in this case. His article connects the rule in <span class="italic">Lawrence v. Fox</span> with special characteristics of the contractual “common counts” at common <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page884" class="pagebreak">884</span>law and with the procedural code reform that was occurring in New York at the time of the case, as well as with the emergence during the 1960’s and 1970’s of the theory that members of benefitted groups have an enforceable right in claims to government service and welfare programs. We shall return to the contemporary aspects of Professor Waters’s argument later in this Chapter. Now for the true story of <span class="italic">Lawrence v. Fox</span>:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">From the records of the case, we learn that “Holly” was in fact one Hawley, referred to in the complaint as Samuel Hawley. The Buffalo census of 1855 lists no Samuel Hawley, but of the eighteen Hawleys who are listed, only one appears to have had sufficient means to have been involved in a three hundred dollar cash transaction. He was Merwin Spencer Hawley, a prominent merchant. In 1856, Hawley was President of the Buffalo Board of Trade, an organization with which Fox, at some point, was also connected…. The assumption that Hawley was affluent and available in Buffalo when Lawrence sued Fox does nothing, however, to solve the mystery of why Lawrence chose not to sue him. The solution to that mystery lies in the nature of Lawrence’s transaction with Hawley, of which Hawley’s dealings with Fox on the next day are highly suggestive.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In 1854, when the transaction took place, three hundred dollars was a very large amount of money. Even among successful entrepreneurs, a loan the size of Hawley’s to Fox, to be repaid a day later, must have been out of the ordinary…. At trial in the Superior Court in Buffalo, Fox’s attorney, Jared Torrance, shed some light on the nature of that transaction. The only witness in the case was William Riley, by whom Lawrence’s attorney, Edward Chapin, had proved that Hawley paid three hundred dollars to Fox; that Hawley told Fox that he, Hawley, owed that amount to Lawrence; and that Fox promised Hawley that he would repay that amount to Lawrence. On cross-examination, Torrance elicited four facts: that Lawrence was not present when Hawley made the loan to Fox; that the deal took place at Mr. Purdy Merritt’s on Washington Street; that there were “two or three persons present * * * doing nothing but standing near them”; and that Hawley counted out the money as he handed it to Fox.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The first fact, that Lawrence was not present, formed the basis of Fox’s privity defense. This defense makes sense only in an action based on contract, a point to which we shall return. For now, it is the other three facts—the location, the bystanders, and the cash being counted out—that are noteworthy, for they suggest the milieu in which the transaction took place, and help to explain its character.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">William Riley, the witness, was a horse dealer. He did his business near the canal, the life line of Buffalo’s then-thriving commerce. Not many steps away was Mr. Purdy Merritt’s establishment, where the transaction took place; Merritt was also a horse dealer. Torrance’s cross-examination presented a more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page885" class="pagebreak">885</span>complete picture: two well-to-do merchants in a horse dealer’s establishment down by the canal; a large amount of cash changing hands; and several other people present, loitering. Of these facts, not the least significant was the location:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Canal Street was more than a street. It was the name of a district, a small and sinful neighborhood * * *. As late as the 1800’s, there were ninety-three saloons there, among which were sprinkled fifteen other dives known as concert halls plus sundry establishments designed to separate the sucker from his money as swiftly as possible, painlessly by preference, but painfully if necessary * * *. It must have been an eternal mystery to the clergy and the good people of the town why the Lord never wiped out this nineteenth century example of Sodom and Gamorrah with a storm or a great wave from Lake Erie.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In his cross-examination of Riley, Attorney Torrance had gone as far as he could go to set the scene for what he then sought to prove directly, also by William Riley: that Hawley lent the money to Fox for Fox to gamble with it, and that this unlawful purpose was known to Hawley.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Trial Judge Joseph Masten did not, however, permit Riley to testify to the alleged link with gambling. Attorney Chapin, for Lawrence, successfully objected on two grounds, neither of which bears upon the probable truth or untruth of the evidence that Riley was prepared to give. As to that question, the facts that Torrance had already elicited do suggest a setting in which gambling could have been taking place. But there is one more fact, this one uncontroverted, that is entirely consistent with the allegation of a connection with gambling and is difficult to explain otherwise. That fact—the central mystery of this case—is that Lawrence chose to sue not his debtor, Hawley, but his debtor’s debtor, Fox. If, as seems to be the fact, Hawley was a person of considerable wealth in Buffalo, and if, as alleged, he owed three hundred dollars to Lawrence, then Lawrence must have had compelling reason to neglect the obvious action—suing Hawley—in favor of the much more difficult task of seeking recovery from Fox. A gambling debt would have presented just such a reason. If Hawley’s debt to Lawrence from the day before, in the round sum of three hundred dollars, was itself the outcome of gambling and thus unenforceable at law, Lawrence was well advised to look for someone other than Hawley to sue. Furthermore, if we look to the law of gamblers rather than the law of commerce, it is clear that Fox, and not Hawley, was both the villain and the obvious person to pursue.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Commercial transactions were not then and are not now structured in such a way as to leave a creditor with no better means of recovery than to sue his debtor’s debtor. The series of events described in <span class="italic">Lawrence v. Fox</span> makes no commercial sense…. had Lawrence’s dealings with Hawley been of a kind condoned and upheld by the law of the land, then Lawrence would surely have sued <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page886" class="pagebreak">886</span>Hawley, and not Fox. It is not surprising, therefore, that there was no theory of recovery in the law of contracts by which Lawrence could collect from Fox.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Lawrence v. Fox</span> leaves unsettled what kinds of beneficiaries could enforce any particular obligation. A broad grant of power to claim under the contract to everyone who could show that they would have been benefitted by a performance, and hence had lost by a breach, would have made a shambles of the law. A long-term manufacturing agreement between industrial giants will benefit not only the parties, but may also provide employment to a whole community. In the event of breach, may any employee, citizen, property owner, taxing authority, taxpayer, or shopkeeper sue to enforce the agreement or for the damages he suffers from its breach? Or consider an agreement to build a wonderful museum expected to enrich the cultural life of the community as well as raise neighboring property values. Can disappointed art lovers or neighbors sue for breach and collect damages for the injuries suffered by their souls and their pocketbooks respectively?</p>
<p class="indent">The law calls those beneficiaries who cannot claim “incidental beneficiaries”—a label that again neatly states a legal conclusion but is of no help in identifying such a beneficiary. Nor is the oft-stated test of “intent to benefit” of much help, except in the negative sense that there cannot be an intent to benefit anyone not explicitly identified in the contract, either by name or by membership in a well-defined class.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, beneficiaries who <span class="bold"><span class="italic">can</span></span> claim (i.e., who are not incidental beneficiaries) have been divided into donee (or sole) and creditor beneficiaries. Donees had the easier time getting judicial support. A typical donee might be the beneficiary of a life insurance policy who has trouble collecting from an intransigent insurer and finds that the deceased insured’s executor won’t sue on his behalf because the estate, after all, has nothing to gain by such action! In such a case, of course, the insured’s intent to benefit the beneficiary named by her in the insurance policy is clear.</p>
<p class="indent">The creditor cases, of which <span class="italic">Lawrence v. Fox</span> is the classic example, were (and are) more difficult to justify because discerning an “intent to benefit” the creditor requires a considerable amount of imagination. It takes a lot of double talk to convince anyone that Holly’s primary intent in making his deal with Fox was to benefit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page887" class="pagebreak">887</span>his <span class="bold"><span class="italic">creditor</span></span>, Lawrence. He intended to benefit <span class="bold"><span class="italic">himself</span></span>. In this sense, intent to benefit is often a fiction—but one that works.</p>
<p class="indent">Restatement, Second, Contracts has adopted the label “intended beneficiary” to cover both donee and creditor beneficiaries; and it has retained the label “incidental beneficiary” to cover all those who, unlike the intended beneficiaries, cannot enforce the contract.</p>

<p class="indent">The complaint alleged as two separate claims, first, that defendant was negligent in a number of particulars and, second, that he failed to carry out a contractual promise to his client, the decedent, which the decedent had intended specifically for the benefit of plaintiff. In other states plaintiffs in such cases have sometimes been allowed to recover on one or both of these theories, as negligently injured parties or as third-party beneficiaries under a contract. It is a new question in this court.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page888" class="pagebreak">888</div>
<p class="indent">Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the stated facts did not constitute a claim under either theory and that, at least as to the tort theory, the action was not commenced within the time limited by the applicable statute. The circuit court held that the action was not time-barred but allowed defendant’s motion to dismiss both claims. On plaintiff’s appeal, the Court of Appeals reinstated plaintiff’s negligence claim, and it also remanded for trial her allegations that defendant was estopped from invoking the statute of limitations.</p>
<p class="indent">Both parties petitioned this court for review. Defendant asserts that a lawyer owes a professional duty of care only to his client and cannot be sued for malpractice by others who are injured by the way he performs that duty. Plaintiff asks us to reinstate her contract claim as a third-party beneficiary. We hold that the complaint states claims for damages under both theories, a claim as the intended beneficiary of defendant’s professional contract with the decedent and a derivative tort claim based on breach of the duty created by that contract to the plaintiff as its intended beneficiary.</p>
<p class="indent">The two claims are related, but they differ in important respects. Standing alone, without a duty to plaintiff derived from defendant’s contractual undertaking, plaintiff’s tort claim would confront the rule that one ordinarily is not liable for negligently causing a stranger’s purely economic loss without injuring his person or property. It does not suffice that the harm is a foreseeable consequence of negligent conduct that may make one liable to someone else, for instance to a client. Some source of a duty outside the common law of negligence is required. Even then, tort rules such as comparative fault may apply that do not apply to contract claims. A contract claim, on the other hand, does not necessarily depend on showing negligence.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar claims were made in <span class="italic">Currey v. Butcher</span>, in which attorneys were charged with a faulty search of a title. This court held that they were entitled to an instruction that they would not be liable to a person for whom their client may have acted unbeknownst to them. A chief precedent for <span class="italic">Currey</span> was <span class="italic">Buckley v. Gray</span>, which the court cited for the proposition that “an attorney employed to draw a will is not liable to a person who, through the attorney’s ignorance or negligence in the discharge of his professional duties, was deprived of the portion of the estate which the testator instructed the attorney should be given such person by the will.” <span class="italic">Currey</span>, 37 Or. at 389.</p>
<p class="indent">Since 1900, many courts have reconsidered that proposition, some preferring a contract analysis, some negligence, and at least one “a definite maybe.” <span class="italic">Buckley v. Gray</span> itself was overruled in <span class="italic">Lucas v. Hamm</span>. The California Supreme Court stated that a lawyer might be liable to an intended testamentary beneficiary either for negligence or for breach of the lawyer’s contract with the testator, though the court balked at recognizing professional negligence in a lawyer’s failure to meet the state’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page889" class="pagebreak">889</span>rule against perpetuities and restraints on alienation.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_167" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-167" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> After <span class="italic">Lucas</span>, the California court treated contract liability as superfluous and settled on negligence theory, which in California calls for applying “public policy” by “balancing” half a dozen “factors” in each case.</p>
<p class="indent">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court chose the contrary course in <span class="italic">Guy v. Liederbach</span>, a claim by a beneficiary who lost a legacy because the testator’s lawyer let her subscribe as a witness to the will. The court rejected both open-ended tort liability to foreseeably injured third parties and what it considered the “unworkable” California standard noting that: “* * * although a plaintiff on a third party beneficiary theory in contract may in some cases have to show a deviation from the standard of care, as in negligence, to establish breach, the class of persons to whom the defendant may be liable is restricted by principles of contract law, not negligence principles relating to foreseeability or scope of the risk.” Citing <span class="italic">dictum</span> in an early Pennsylvania decision, <span class="italic">Lawall v. Groman</span>, the court settled instead on liability to the intended beneficiary under Restatement (Second) Contracts section 302(1) (1981).</p>
<p class="indent">The Connecticut Supreme Court similarly allowed a disappointed beneficiary of a testamentary trust to proceed against the testatrix’s lawyer on a contract theory over an objection that the lawyer’s promise obligated him only to the client and not to the intended beneficiary, because the benefit to the plaintiff also was the essence of the benefit promised to the testatrix.</p>
<p class="indent">We agree that the beneficiary in these cases is not only a plausible but a classic “intended” third-party beneficiary of the lawyer’s promise to his client within the rule of Restatement section 302(1)(b) and may enforce the duty so created, as stated id. section 304. The promise, of course, was not that the lawyer would pay plaintiff the stipulated sum, and it is too late for the lawyer to perform the promise that he did make, but this does not preclude an action for damages for the nonperformance. In principle, such an action is available to one in plaintiff’s position.</p>
<p class="indent">Because under third-party analysis the contract creates a “duty” not only to the promisee, the client, but also to the intended beneficiary, negligent nonperformance may give rise to a negligence action as well. Not every such contract will support either claim. A contract to prepare a will or other instrument may promise different things. It may undertake to make a particular disposition by means specified by the client (for instance, in trust, or by a gift of identified property), or to accomplish the intended gift by specified means of the lawyer’s choosing. Failure to do what was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page890" class="pagebreak">890</span>promised then would be a breach of contract regardless of any negligence. On the other hand, the lawyer’s promise might be to use his best professional efforts to accomplish the specified result with the skill and care customary among lawyers in the relevant community. Because negligence liability of this kind arises only from the professional obligation to the client, it does not threaten to divide a lawyer’s loyalty between the client and a potentially injured third party, as defendant argues.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether breach of that kind of promise is properly characterized as a breach of contract or as negligence, we have said, depends on the legal rule for which its character is at issue. <span class="italic">Securities–Intermountain v. Sunset Fuel</span>. That case, like this one, involved an issue whether the action was commenced in time….</p>
<p class="indent">The pertinent allegations of the contract claim were:</p>
<p class="blockquote">18. Relying on defendant’s promise to select a better legal mechanism by which to give plaintiff the gift, Rogers refrained during his lifetime from giving plaintiff his Cooper Industries stock. Defendant specifically told Rogers that defendant would prepare a trust document wherein Rogers and plaintiff would be co-trustees and through which plaintiff would receive the gift Rogers’ [sic] intended her to have. Rogers specifically directed defendant to draft the trust and to include plaintiff’s $300,000 gift.</p>
<p class="blockquote">19. On March 8, 1982, defendant presented a trust document to Rogers for Rogers to execute. Defendant told Rogers and plaintiff, who were co-trustees of the trust, that the document included the $300,000 gift to plaintiff. Relying on defendant’s representations, Rogers and plaintiff executed the trust without reading it.</p>
<p class="blockquote">20. Defendant and Rogers specifically contracted for defendant to draft the trust document with plaintiff’s gift in it. Defendant breached that contract by failing to include the provision for plaintiff to receive the $300,000 gift.</p>
<p class="indent">These paragraphs allege breach of a specific promise “that defendant would prepare a trust document wherein Rogers and plaintiff would be co-trustees and through which plaintiff would receive the gift Rogers intended her to have,” a “trust document with plaintiff’s gift in it.” They allege, not that defendant performed this promise negligently, but that he did not perform it at all. As far as these allegations went, he might have broken the promise purposely, or under circumstances that might be a partial or entire defense to a negligence claim.</p>
<p class="indent">The allegations of the terms of the contract are not as detailed as those in the architect’s contract annexed to the complaint in <span class="italic">Securities–Intermountain</span>. Whether this agreement in fact was sufficiently specific to go beyond a general promise by defendant to use his professional skills to carry out the assigned project is a matter for proof. Lacking a detailed written contract like that in <span class="italic">Securities–Intermountain</span>, it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page891" class="pagebreak">891</span>may depend on correspondence, memoranda, or testimony. When an alleged contract does not lend itself to incorporation of a writing in the complaint, the issue at least may have to await affidavits and possible counteraffidavits on motion for summary judgment. It should not have been decided on a motion under ORCP 21 to dismiss the complaint….</p>

<p class="indent">The Nemours Foundation (“Nemours”) owns the Alfred I. duPont Institute Children’s Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware. In January 1980 Nemours entered into a general contract with Gilbane Building Company (“Gilbane”) for completion of the interior of the Hospital. The Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (“Aetna”) became surety on a performance bond which named Gilbane as principal and Nemours as obligee.</p>
<p class="indent">Gilbane entered into a number of subcontracts, including a $35.9 million fixed-price subcontract with Pierce Associates, Inc. (“Pierce”) pursuant to which Pierce agreed to perform the mechanical work on the project (the heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, plumbing and fire-protection systems). Federal Insurance Company (“Federal”) became surety on a performance bond which named Pierce as principal and Gilbane as obligee.</p>
<p class="indent">Disputes arose about performance under the general contract and under the subcontracts, and complex multi-party litigation ensued. During pretrial proceedings there were various changes in the parties’ positions and realignments of adversaries which resulted in a trial at which Nemours and its general contractor Gilbane (joined by its surety Aetna) were plaintiffs seeking damages against Gilbane’s subcontractor Pierce and Pierce’s surety Federal.</p>
<p class="indent">After a 79 day trial the jury found in favor of Nemours and Gilbane on all their claims against Pierce and Federal and found against Pierce on its counterclaims. On September 15, 1986 final judgment was entered awarding $26,017,411 in damages and pre-judgment interest to Nemours and $3,018,372 in damages and pre-judgment interest to Gilbane….</p>
<p class="indent">These appeals do not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. Rather, they challenge the legal sufficiency of the claims submitted to the jury and concern legal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page892" class="pagebreak">892</span>rulings of the trial court. The facts upon which these rulings were based are not in dispute.</p>
<p class="indent">… [I]n January 1980 Nemours entered into a general contract with Gilbane to complete the interior of its Children’s Hospital. This contract includes the American Institute of Architects’ “General Conditions of the Contract of Construction” (1976 ed.) (the “AIA General Conditions”). Article 1.1.2 of the AIA General conditions states: Nothing contained in the Contract Documents shall create any contractual relationship between the Owner [Nemours] or the Architect and any Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor.</p>
<p class="indent">Gilbane in turn entered into a number of subcontracts. The largest was its $35.9 million fixed-price subcontract with Pierce, executed in June 1980 which called for Pierce to perform the mechanical work on the project. Gilbane entered into other subcontracts including a $19.7 million subcontract with Dynalectric Company (“Dynalectric”) for electrical work and an $8.6 million subcontract with Honeywell, Inc. (“Honeywell”) for installation of the building management systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 1 of the Gilbane–Pierce subcontract provided that Pierce would “furnish all materials and perform all work as described in Section 2 hereof for Phase 5B: A.I. duPont Institute for the Nemours Foundation Hospital Building * * * all in accordance with the Drawings and Specifications * * * and subject in every detail to the supervision and satisfaction of [Gilbane] and of [Nemours] or his duly authorized representative.”</p>
<p class="indent">The subcontract provided in Section 6 that “[Pierce] agrees to be bound to [Gilbane] by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Drawings and Specifications, the General Contract and the General Conditions for construction * * *, and to assume toward [Gilbane] all the obligations and responsibilities that [Gilbane], by these documents, assumes toward [Nemours].” The General Conditions, of course, contained the provision that nothing contained in the “Contract Documents” shall create any contractual relationship between Nemours and any subcontractor.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of provisions in the subcontract, particularly those found in Section 7, imposed upon Pierce specific obligations vis-a-vis Nemours. For example: Section 7(a) requires Pierce to “furnish Shop Drawings, Erection Drawings, Details, Samples, etc.,” for Nemours’ approval. Section 7(b) bestowed upon Nemours the right to agree on lump sum pricing of changes to Pierce’s work. Section 7(c) gave Nemours the right to inspect and condemn Pierce’s work and required Pierce to “make good” the condemned work at its own expense. Section 7(e) required Pierce to “indemnify and save harmless” Nemours from any expenses, liability or loss arising from patent, copyright or trademark infringement.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page893" class="pagebreak">893</div>
<p class="indent">After the terms of the Gilbane–Pierce subcontract were agreed upon, Gilbane sent it to Nemours for approval. By letter dated September 9, 1980 Nemours approved the subcontract and also stated, “[b]y this approval, The Nemours Foundation does not waive, and expressly reserves all of its rights and remedies under said contract and nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to create any contractual relationship between The Nemours Foundation and said subcontractor.” At the foot of the letter Gilbane executed the following: “Receipt and Acceptance acknowledged this 19th day of September, 1980.”</p>
<p class="indent">Pursuant to the requirements of the subcontract Pierce furnished Gilbane a performance bond naming Pierce as principal, Federal as surety and Gilbane as obligee. Two provisions are pertinent to the present case. The bond provides, “No right of action shall accrue on this bond to or for the use of any person or corporation other than the Obligee named herein or the heirs, executors, administrators or successors of the Obligee.” Immediately after that provision there appears the following: “Provided, however, that this Performance Bond issued on behalf of the named Principal may not be assigned to any party other than the Owner, The Nemours Foundation, without the consent of the Sureties.” The bond was never assigned to Nemours.</p>
<p class="indent">Gilbane and its subcontractors commenced performance under their respective contracts. Serious delays ensued, the causes of which were the subject of vigorous disagreement. The delays and disputes over contract plans and specifications, design revisions, job progress schedules, progress payments and change orders resulted in Nemours withholding payments. In response, in April 1983 Pierce suspended performance under the subcontract. Although the other subcontractors asserted claims against Gilbane and Nemours, they stayed on the job.</p>
<p class="indent">To meet the situation created by Pierce’s abandonment of the job, Nemours hired contractors to correct and finish Pierce’s work under the direction of Turner Construction Company (“Turner”). Gilbane and its other subcontractors coordinated with Turner and the completion contractors to finish the Hospital. Substantial completion took place by December 1984 twenty-one months late.</p>
<p class="indent">Not surprisingly, litigation ensued….</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III. T<small>HIRD</small> P<small>ARTY</small> B<small>ENEFICIARY</small> C<small>LAIMS</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">It must first be determined whether the district court erred as a matter of law by holding that Nemours was a third party beneficiary of the Gilbane–Pierce subcontract. Since this issue involves only a question of law the standard of review is plenary….</p>
<p class="indent">“It is well settled in Delaware that a third-party may recover on a contract made for his benefit * * *. But in order for there to be a third party beneficiary, the contracting parties must intend to confer the benefit.” The intent to confer a third party beneficiary benefit is to be determined from the language of the contract.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page894" class="pagebreak">894</div>
<p class="indent">Thus in the present case an intent to confer third party beneficiary status on Nemours must be gleaned from the language of the Gilbane–Pierce subcontract. The language of a contract, however, cannot be divorced from the context in which it was written. Here, we are dealing with a general contract and a subcontract in the construction industry.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically when major construction is involved an owner has neither the desire nor the ability to negotiate with and supervise the multitude of trades and skills required to complete a project. Consequently an owner will engage a general contractor. The general contractor will retain, coordinate and supervise subcontractors. The owner looks to the general contractor, not the subcontractors, both for performance of the total construction project and for any damages or other relief if there is a default in performance. Performance and the payment of damages are normally assured by the bond of a surety on which the general contractor is principal and the owner is the obligee.</p>
<p class="indent">The general contractor, in turn, who is responsible for the performance of the subcontractors, has a right of action against any subcontractor which defaults. Performance and payment of damages by a subcontractor are normally assured by the bond of a surety on which the subcontractor is principal and the general contractor is the obligee.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus the typical owner is insulated from the subcontractors both during the course of construction and during the pursuit of remedies in the event of a default. Conversely, the subcontractors are insulated from the owner. The owner deals with and, if necessary, sues the general contractor, and the general contractor deals with and, if necessary, sues the subcontractors.</p>
<p class="indent">These typical construction contract relationships have long been recognized:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[Contracts between a principal building contractor and subcontractors] are made to enable the principal contractor to perform; and their performance by the subcontractor does not in itself discharge the principal contractor’s duty to the owner with whom he has contracted. The installation of plumbing fixtures or the construction of cement floors by a subcontractor is not a discharge of the principal contractor’s duty to the owner to deliver a finished building containing those items; and if after their installation the undelivered building is destroyed by fire, the principal contractor must replace them for the owner, even though he must pay the subcontractor in full and has no right that the latter shall replace them. It seems, therefore, that the owner has no right against the subcontractor, in the absence of clear words to the contrary. The owner is neither a creditor beneficiary nor a donee beneficiary; the benefit that he receives from performance must be regarded as merely incidental.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page895" class="pagebreak">895</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A contractor entered into a contract with the Government, the latter promising to pay the cost plus a fixed fee and assenting to the letting of subcontracts. In such a case it is clear, in the absence of evidence of a different intention, that the subcontractor is not a beneficiary of the Government’s promise to the contractor to pay the cost, even though the amount payable to the subcontractor is reckoned as part of the cost. The Government made no promise to pay anything to the subcontractors. For similar reasons, the Government is not a beneficiary of a subcontractor’s promise to the contractor, even though the performance promised may enable the contractor to perform his contractual duty to the Government.</p>
<p class="noindent">4 Corbin on Contracts § 779D (1951 ed.) at 46, 47.</p>
<p class="indent">These typical construction relationships are also recognized in Delaware law. In <span class="italic">Cannon</span>, the Delaware Supreme Court referred to the “buffer zone” which a general contract creates between the owner and a subcontractor, although in that case it found that the language of the subcontract evidenced an intent to extinguish the buffer zone.</p>
<p class="indent">There is nothing to prevent a departure from the typical pattern, and, as was the case in <span class="italic">Cannon</span>, a contractor and subcontractor may agree to confer upon an owner rights which are enforceable directly against the subcontractor. However, an intent to do so must be found in the contract documents. Thus in the present case it must be determined whether the Gilbane–Pierce subcontract evidences an intent on the part of both Pierce and Gilbane to depart from the typical owner-general contractor and general contractor-subcontractor relationships to confer upon Nemours a direct right of action against Pierce.</p>
<p class="indent">The overall structure of the contractual relationships in this case falls into the traditional mold. Nemours as owner entered into a general contract with Gilbane. Gilbane’s obligations were assured by a performance bond issued by Aetna. Gilbane entered into a number of subcontracts, including the one with Pierce. Each subcontractor’s obligations were assured by a performance bond, a performance bond issued by Federal in the case of Pierce. If indeed Gilbane intended that the subcontract create an obligation running directly from Pierce to Nemours, it is curious that it accepted (in fact, prescribed) a performance bond which provided that no right of action would accrue on it to or for the use of any person other than Gilbane.</p>
<p class="indent">The language of the Gilbane–Pierce subcontract suggests that Gilbane and Pierce contemplated that Pierce was to be obligated to Gilbane, not to Nemours.</p>
<p class="indent">The subcontract is between Pierce, as subcontractor, and Gilbane as the contractor. Section 6 specified Gilbane as the entity to which Pierce was to be responsible: “The Subcontractor agrees to be bound to the Contractor by the terms and conditions of the Agreement * * * and to assume toward the Contractor all the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page896" class="pagebreak">896</span>obligations and responsibilities that the Contractor, by these documents, assumes toward the Owner.”</p>
<p class="indent">Of significance is the incorporation of the standard AIA General Conditions of the Contract for Construction into both the general contract and the subcontract. Article 1.1.2 of the General Conditions provides: “Nothing contained in the Contract Documents shall create any contractual relationship between the Owner or the Architect and any Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nemours urges that in light of the definition of “Contract Documents” in Article 1.1.1, the Article 1.1.2 language serves only to preclude the general contract from creating a contractual relationship between Nemours as owner and Pierce as subcontractor but does not preclude the subcontract from creating such a relationship. Article 1.1.2 provides that “[n]othing contained in the Contract Documents shall create any contractual relationship between the Owner * * * and any Subcontractor * * *.” As defined in Article 1.1.1, however, “Contract Documents” does not include the subcontract and, therefore, Nemours argues, there is no prohibition against the subcontract creating a third party beneficiary relationship between Nemours and Pierce.</p>
<p class="indent">If the Article 1.1.2 language appeared only in the general contract, Nemours’ argument might be persuasive. However, there was repeated incorporation of the General Conditions and its Article 1.1.2 language into the subcontract.</p>
<p class="indent">At page 1A of the subcontract it is provided that all work thereunder shall be in accordance with “General Conditions of the Contract for Construction, in (sic) Specifications, (AIA Document A201—1976 Edition).” In Section 6, referred to above, Pierce as subcontractor agrees to be bound by the General Contract and the General Conditions for Construction. Section 7(g) provides that “[t]he Terms and Provisions herein contained and the General Conditions For Construction (AIA Document A201—1976 Edition) * * * shall supersede all previous communications, representations, or agreements, either oral or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.”</p>
<p class="indent">This repeated incorporation of the General Conditions and its Article 1.1.2 no contractual relationship language is a strong indication of an intent on Gilbane’s and Pierce’s part to maintain the separate owner-general contractor and general contractor-subcontractor relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">No Delaware court appears to have construed general contracts or subcontracts which contain Article 1.1.2 of the AIA General Conditions or comparable language. Decisions in other jurisdictions, however, have held that this provision (or like language) prevents an owner from maintaining a breach of contract action against a subcontractor on a third party beneficiary theory, or prevents a subcontractor from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page897" class="pagebreak">897</span>maintaining a breach of contract action against an owner on such a theory. Thus the buffer is preserved by Article 1.1.2 or its equivalent.</p>
<p class="indent">Nemours’ principal argument in support of its third party beneficiary theory is that the Gilbane–Pierce subcontract contains numerous provisions which evidence an intent that Nemours be benefited by Pierce’s performance. The description of Pierce’s work in Section 1 provides that it shall be subject to the supervision and satisfaction of the contractor and the owner. There are a number of other provisions which impose obligations on Pierce vis-a-vis Nemours, such as an obligation to furnish Shop Drawings, Erection Drawings, etc. for Nemours’ approval, the requirement that Pierce indemnify and save harmless Nemours from any expense, liability or loss arising from patent, copyright or trademark infringement.</p>
<p class="indent">In every construction subcontract the owner is the one which ultimately benefits from its performance. However, this does not create a third party beneficiary relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that the subcontract does not manifest an intent by Pierce and Gilbane to confer third party beneficiary status upon Nemours. In fact, the subcontract evidences an intent to preclude such a status. Nemours and Gilbane were but two of three parties in a relationship carefully structured by contract (the general contract and the subcontract). Pierce was the third party in that relationship. By means of the settlement agreement Nemours and Gilbane, in effect, sought to change that relationship to give Nemours a previously non-existent direct cause of action against Pierce. Without Pierce’s participation that was not possible. Contractual rights cannot be so casually disregarded.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus to the extent that the judgment of the trial court rests upon Nemours’ third party beneficiary claim it must be reversed.</p>
<p id="sec460" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTION</span></p>
<p class="indent">What is gained by insisting that Nemours sue Gilbane and then have Gilbane sue Pierce, rather than allowing Nemours to sue Pierce directly? Isn’t Nemours the truly injured party and Pierce the party whose breach has caused Nemours’ damages?</p>

<p class="indent">Recognizing a third-party beneficiary expands the community of the agreement to include a third person, who has rights but no duties. The beneficiary shares in the continuing relationship and has concurrent claims against both of the original parties. In contrast, finding an assignment transfers contractual rights and obligations in an already-formed agreement from a contracting party to a third party.</p>
<p class="indent">The rights and expectations of a party to a contract are likely to be valuable; commonly they will entail the right to payment of money or the receipt of goods or services. A legal mechanism for the transfer of the right to receive a promised performance effectively converts a promise into a form of property that can be traded to form new and hopefully more efficient economic combinations of resources. In short, transferability of contract rights is a key ingredient in the development of a mercantile, industrial, and, ultimately, a credit economy.</p>
<p class="indent">As you learn in your Property course, a major feature of the legal emergence from medieval times was the increasingly free alienability, or transfer, of land held in forms of feudal tenure. As the law faced the need to make the major form of wealth—land—freely transferable, it came also to recognize the need to make transferable the intangible rights created by contract.</p>
<p class="indent">This recognition did not result in an immediate outright repudiation of the old view in favor of a new one favoring transferability. Instead, by a series of devices that are used again and again by lawyers, the old rule continued to be recognized in principle while it was abandoned in practice.</p>
<p class="indent">First came a group of procedural gimmicks, referred to in the preceding readings, by which the transferee might sue and enforce the right under the fiction that he was acting as attorney for the original holder. This legal fiction persisted well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century in many states and is still found in a few today.</p>
<p class="indent">A second device was the carving of exceptions to the general rule in particular compelling cases. The assignment of foreign bills of exchange was recognized as early as the 14<sup>th</sup> century since the negotiability of these bills was a precondition of foreign commerce on any basis other than barter. Gradually the assignability of all commercial paper was recognized, first in the courts of equity and ultimately at law. As has happened in contemporary efforts to expand consumer protection, the claim against strict application of “the law” at this stage is couched in terms of fairness, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page899" class="pagebreak">899</span>conscionability, and commercial necessity. When this stage was reached, all that was left was the substanceless shadow of the old rule; but not until it had been completely eroded by exceptions and fictions was the non-assignability rule swept away formally by statute and judicial decision.</p>
<p class="indent">Today in most states there are comprehensive statutes dealing with assignment problems in the special context of security interests; accounts receivable; negotiable instruments and other commercial paper; consumer credit; wage assignments; small loans; and government contracts. The area, therefore, is one in which general contract doctrine has been supplanted in many vital respects by special statutory rules and policies. While in most commercial contexts assignment is now free of its medieval restraints, analogous concerns to those that limited the transfer of real property 700 years ago now motivate statutes protecting wage earners and consumers purchasing on credit from the oppression that can flow from overly free contractual assignment.</p>

<p class="indent">To understand the transfer of contractual interests and the effects of such a transfer, one must distinguish the rights arising from a contract from its obligations.</p>
<p class="indent">Assignment should be distinguished from the third-party beneficiary situation in that the rights of the assignee are sequential and to the exclusion of the original party to the contract, while the beneficiary’s rights are concurrent and exist alongside those of the parties. After an assignment, the assignor retains no rights against the obligor, and the obligor cannot relieve himself of his duty by paying the assignor, at least not after he learns of the assignment.</p>
<p class="indent">Most contract rights are to receive performance in the form of money, goods, or services. Certainly as to money, it generally makes no difference to the obligor <span class="bold"><span class="italic">whom</span></span> she pays, so long as that is the <span class="bold"><span class="italic">only</span></span> variation. One person is as good as another, and the substitution of a party has little impact on the promisor’s undertaking. This is not as certainly so if the performance in question is delivery of goods, and even less so in the case of services, for these may be personal in nature. It may make a big difference whom the obligor has to satisfy as a customer, and even more so under whom she must work as an employee.</p>
<p class="indent">Delegation of a contractual obligation is even more problematic, for now the original party is not merely designating a substitute to receive performance; he is now hiring someone to do the job for him. This is far more likely to place the obligee <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page900" class="pagebreak">900</span>(the contracting party entitled to performance) in a materially different transaction than he bargained for.</p>

<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 2–210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights.</span></h4>
<p class="list_alpha">(1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-406, unless otherwise agreed, all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor’s due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(3) The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the seller’s interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer’s chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remains effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of “the contract” is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor’s performance.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(5) An assignment of “the contract” or of “all my rights under the contract” or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page901" class="pagebreak">901</span>those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (§ 2-609).</p>
<p id="sec465" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Consistent use of the terminology (“assignment” applying to contract rights and “delegation” applying to contract obligations) is helpful to prevent confusion. But all lawyers and judges are not always so precise. Sometimes “assignment” is used to cover both assignment and delegation. Can you reword UCC § 2–210 to make it consistent with these definitions and less confusing?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Suppose that Barber enters into a contract with Cleanly to cut Cleanly’s hair once a week for a year in return for Cleanly’s promise to clean Barber’s shop once a week. Compare:</p>
<p class="indent">(a) Cleanly “assigns” this contract to Filthy, and Filthy demands haircuts in return for his weekly cleanings.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Cleanly assigns his right to haircuts to Filthy but continues to tender performance of the cleaning job himself.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Barber breaches his contract with Cleanly, and Cleanly assigns his right of action against Barber to Filthy.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if you think that Barber can insist that “the contract” in (a) isn’t assignable, can he equally insist under (b) that he doesn’t have to cut Filthy’s hair? If you think that he can refuse to cut Filthy’s hair, is it because he depended on Cleanly’s character, skill, etc.? Is either objection applicable to (c)?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Was the early common law right after all in its determination that contracts created strictly personal relations, and, therefore, even unconditional money rights arising out of them were unassignable? If A owes B, and B assigns A’s debt to C, why should debtor A be required to pay C—someone with whom it has never “done business”? Doesn’t this subject A, perhaps against its will, to a different duty than it originally undertook?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Assume that Jones agrees to sell his pet dog to Kindly. Can Kindly assign her claim to Cruel? Suppose that Jones doesn’t want his dog in Cruel’s hands? Could Kindly have taken delivery of the dog, paid for it, and then sold it to Cruel if the contract of purchase didn’t restrict her future conduct with respect to the dog? Any <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page902" class="pagebreak">902</span>difference? If Jones breached his contract with Kindly, could Kindly assign her right of action against Jones to Cruel? Any difference?</p>

<p id="sec466" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Herzog v. Irace</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Maine Supreme Judicial Court, 1991.</p>
<p class="sectionb">594 A.2d 1106.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ B<small>RODY</small>, J….</p>
<p class="indent">The facts of this case are not disputed. Gary Jones was injured in a motorcycle accident and retained Irace and Lowry to represent him in a personal injury action. Soon thereafter, Jones dislocated his shoulder, twice, in incidents unrelated to the motorcycle accident. Dr. Herzog examined Jones’s shoulder and concluded that he needed surgery. At the time, however, Jones was unable to pay for the surgery and in consideration for the performance of the surgery by the doctor, he signed a letter dated June 14, 1988, written on Dr. Herzog’s letterhead stating: “I, Gary Jones, request that payment be made directly from settlement of a claim currently pending for an unrelated incident, to John Herzog, D.O., for treatment of a shoulder injury which occurred at a different time.” Dr. Herzog notified Irace and Lowry that Jones had signed an “assignment of benefits” from the motorcycle personal injury action to cover the cost of surgery on his shoulder and was informed by an employee of Irace and Lowry that the assignment was sufficient to allow the firm to pay Dr. Herzog’s bills at the conclusion of the case. Dr. Herzog performed the surgery and continued to treat Jones for approximately one year.</p>
<p class="indent">In May, 1989, Jones received a $20,000 settlement in the motorcycle personal injury action. He instructed Irace and Lowry not to disburse any funds to Dr. Herzog indicating that he would make the payments himself. Irace and Lowry informed Dr. Herzog that Jones had revoked his permission to have the bill paid by them directly and indicated that they would follow Jones’s directions. Irace and Lowry issued a check to Jones for $10,027 and disbursed the remaining funds to Jones’s other creditors. Jones did send a check to Dr. Herzog but the check was returned by the bank for insufficient funds and Dr. Herzog was never paid.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Herzog filed a complaint in District Court against Irace and Lowry seeking to enforce the June 14, 1988 “assignment of benefits.” The matter was tried before the court on the basis of a joint stipulation of facts. The court entered a judgment in favor of Dr. Herzog finding that the June 14, 1988 letter constituted a valid assignment of the settlement proceeds enforceable against Irace and Lowry. Following an unsuccessful appeal to the Superior Court, Irace and Lowry appealed to this court. Because the Superior Court acted as an intermediate appellate court, we review the District Court’s decision directly.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page903" class="pagebreak">903</div>
<p class="indent">An assignment is an act or manifestation by the owner of a right (the assignor) indicating his intent to transfer that right to another person (the assignee). For an assignment to be valid and enforceable against the assignor’s creditor (the obligor), the assignor must make clear his intent to relinquish the right to the assignee and must not retain any control over the right assigned or any power of revocation. The assignment takes effect through the actions of the assignor and assignee and the obligor need not accept the assignment to render it valid. Once the obligor has notice of the assignment, the fund is “from that time forward impressed with a trust; it is * * * impounded in the [obligor’s] hands, and must be held by him not for the original creditor, the assignor, but for the substituted creditor, the assignee.” After receiving notice of the assignment, the obligor cannot lawfully pay the amount assigned either to the assignor or to his other creditors and if the obligor does make such a payment, he does so at his peril because the assignee may enforce his rights against the obligor directly.</p>
<p class="indent">Ordinary rights, including future rights, are freely assignable unless the assignment would materially change the duty of the obligor, materially increase the burden or risk imposed upon the obligor by his contract, impair the obligor’s chance of obtaining return performance, or materially reduce the value of the return performance to the obligor, and unless the law restricts the assignability of the specific right involved. See Restatement (Second) Contracts § 317(2)(a) (1982). In Maine, the transfer of a future right to proceeds from pending litigation has been recognized as a valid and enforceable equitable assignment. An equitable assignment need not transfer the entire future right but rather may be a partial assignment of that right. We reaffirm these well established principles.</p>
<p class="indent">Relying primarily upon the Federal District Court’s decision in <span class="italic">Shiro</span>, 174 F.Supp. 495, a bankruptcy case involving the trustee’s power to avoid a preferential transfer by assignment, Irace and Lowry contend that Jones’s June 14, 1988 letter is invalid and unenforceable as an assignment because it fails to manifest Jones’s intent to permanently relinquish all control over the assigned funds and does nothing more than request payment from a specific fund. We disagree. The June 14, 1988 letter gives no indication that Jones attempted to retain any control over the funds he assigned to Dr. Herzog. Taken in context, the use of the word “request” did not give the court reason to question Jones’s intent to complete the assignment and, although no specific amount was stated, the parties do not dispute that the services provided by Dr. Herzog and the amounts that he charged for those services were reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the shoulder injury referred to in the June 14 letter. Irace and Lowry had adequate funds to satisfy all of Jones’s creditors, including Dr. Herzog, with funds left over for disbursement to Jones himself. Thus, this case simply does not present a situation analogous to <span class="italic">Shiro</span> because Dr. Herzog <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page904" class="pagebreak">904</span>was [not] given preference over Jones’s other creditors by operation of the assignment. Given that Irace and Lowry do not dispute that they had ample notice of the assignment, the court’s finding on the validity of the assignment is fully supported by the evidence and will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Ethical Obligations</span></p>
<p class="indent">Next, Irace and Lowry contend that the assignment, if enforceable against them, would interfere with their ethical obligation to honor their client’s instruction in disbursing funds. Again, we disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the Maine Bar Rules, an attorney generally may not place a lien on a client’s file for a third party. M.Bar R. 3.7(c). The Bar Rules further require that an attorney “promptly pay or deliver to the client, as requested by the client, the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive.” M.Bar R. 3.6(f)(2)(iv). The rules say nothing, however, about a client’s power to assign his right to proceeds from a pending lawsuit to third parties. Because the client has the power to assign his right to funds held by his attorney, it follows that a valid assignment must be honored by the attorney in disbursing the funds on the client’s behalf. The assignment does not create a conflict under Rule 3.6(f)(2)(iv) because the client is not entitled to receive funds once he has assigned them to a third party. Nor does the assignment violate Rule 3.7(c), because the client, not the attorney, is responsible for placing the incumbrance upon the funds. Irace and Lowry were under no ethical obligation, and the record gives no indication that they were under a contractual obligation, to honor their client’s instruction to disregard a valid assignment. The District Court correctly concluded that the assignment is valid and enforceable against Irace and Lowry.</p>
<p class="indent">The entry is:</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec467" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. This case involves an “assignment for security,” which is a secured transaction subject to UCC Article 9. That is Dr. Herzog took the assignment only to secure payment of his fees, and his property interest in the proceeds of the lawsuit was accordingly limited to the extent of the secured obligation, i.e. the amount of the fees owed. Article 9 covers almost all transactions in which the parties intend to create a security interest in personal property. While a discussion of Article 9 is outside the scope of a first year Contracts course, one noteworthy aspect of Article 9 is the concept of “perfection.” Perfection of a security interest provides the secured party with legal protection against competing claims of third parties. Typically this is accomplished by filing a “financing statement” with the appropriate government <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page905" class="pagebreak">905</span>agency, obtaining “control” over certain types of intangible property, or in the case of tangible property or negotiable instruments, perhaps by taking physical possession of the collateral. In certain situations perfection may be automatic upon the creation of the security interest. Absent perfection, the secured transaction is enforceable as between the debtor-assignor and the secured party, but the secured party’s unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of bona fide purchasers (or assignees) for value, other perfected secured parties, lien creditors of the debtor-assignor or the debtor-assignor’s bankruptcy trustee.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The common law traditionally resisted the idea that litigation claims might be freely transferred from injured parties to those willing to finance litigation or bear litigation risk. Rules against maintenance and champerty limited the ability of plaintiffs to transfer their claims to third parties, purportedly to prevent speculation in ill-founded litigation claims. In the United States the institution of the contingent fee has long allowed lawyers to partner-up with their clients in financing the client’s litigation by taking an interest in the proceeds, but in general third parties were not permitted to do so. These traditional prohibitions appear to be relaxing in the face of modern free-market ideology, and increasingly third-party private investors are looking to acquire interests in litigation claims in exchange for providing financing and liquidity to injured plaintiffs holding unliquidated and disputed litigation claims. Professor Jonathan Molot, <span class="italic">A Market in Litigation Risk</span>, 76 U. C<small>HI</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 367 (2009), discusses this trend and posits a brave new world where lawyers assume the role of traders, brokers, and investors in litigation claims:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Client service need not be the defining feature of lawyering. A lawyer may use the same skills and engage in the same predictive enterprise whether he is advising a client appearing before a judge, advising a hedge fund buying stock in that company, or making an investment in the company for his own account. Moreover, a lawyer who uses his legal skills to transfer legal risk from risk-averse litigants to profit-seeking investors or insurers may serve the litigants (and society) just as effectively as those lawyers who perform the traditional professional function of advising clients. The legal profession should embrace lawyers who choose to work as principals or brokers in a market for legal risk just as much as it embraces lawyers who cling to their traditional role as agents for clients.</p>
<p class="indent">Molot concludes by stating his aim in writing the article was “to expand the legal profession’s self-conception so that lawyers consider it within their professional role not only to advise clients on litigation risk but also in some cases to relieve legal-risk bearers of risk.”</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if we are prepared to consign the maintenance and champerty doctrines to the dustbin of history, however, there remain, difficult barriers in transferring unliquidated litigation claims. Not only is the value of such claims uncommonly difficult to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page906" class="pagebreak">906</span>assess, but the plaintiff’s lawyer’s professional obligations of loyalty, zealous representation, and confidentiality may constrain the ability of a third party investor to obtain the information and control over the claim that it will seek if it is to bear the risk.</p>

<p id="sec468" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">The Macke Co. v. Pizza of Gaithersburg</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Maryland Court of Appeals, 1970.</p>
<p class="sectionb">259 Md. 479, 270 A.2d 645.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>INGLEY</small>, J. The appellees and defendants below, Pizza of Gaithersburg, Inc.; Pizzeria, Inc.; The Pizza Pie Corp., Inc. and Pizza Oven, Inc., four corporations under the common ownership of Sidney Ansell, Thomas S. Sherwood and Eugene Early and the same individuals as partners or proprietors (the Pizza Shops) operated at six locations in Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties. The appellees had arranged to have installed in each of their locations cold drink vending machines owned by Virginia Coffee Service, Inc., and on 30 December 1966, this arrangement was formalized at five of the locations, by contracts for terms of one year, automatically renewable for a like term in the absence of 30 days’ written notice. A similar contract for the sixth location, operated by Pizza of Gaithersburg, Inc., was entered into on 25 July 1967.</p>
<p class="indent">On 30 December 1967, Virginia’s assets were purchased by The Macke Company (Macke) and the six contracts were assigned to Macke by Virginia. In January, 1968, the Pizza Shops attempted to terminate the five contracts having the December anniversary date, and in February, the contract which had the July anniversary date.</p>
<p class="indent">Macke brought suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against each of the Pizza Shops for damages for breach of contract. From judgments for the defendants, Macke has appealed.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower court based the result which it reached on two grounds: first, that the Pizza Shops, when they contracted with Virginia, relied on its skill, judgment and reputation, which made impossible a delegation of Virginia’s duties to Macke; and second, that the damages claimed could not be shown with reasonable certainty. These conclusions are challenged by Macke.</p>
<p class="indent">In the absence of a contrary provision—and there was none here—rights and duties under an executory bilateral contract may be assigned and delegated, subject to the exception that duties under a contract to provide personal services may never be delegated, nor rights be assigned under a contract where <span class="italic">delectus personae</span> was an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page907" class="pagebreak">907</span>ingredient of the bargain.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_168" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-168" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> 4 Corbin on Contracts § 865 (1951) at 434; 6 Am.Jur.2d, Assignments § 11 (1963) at 196. <span class="italic">Crane Ice Cream Co. v. Terminal Freezing &amp; Heating Co.</span> held that the right of an individual to purchase ice under a contract which by its terms reflected a knowledge of the individual’s needs and reliance on his credit and responsibility could not be assigned to the corporation which purchased his business. In <span class="italic">Eastern Advertising Co. v. McGaw &amp; Co.</span>, our predecessors held that an advertising agency could not delegate its duties under a contract which had been entered into by an advertiser who had relied on the agency’s skill, judgment and taste.</p>
<p class="indent">The six machines were placed on the appellees’ premises under a printed “Agreement–Contract” which identified the “customer,” gave its place of business, described the vending machine, and then provided:</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">TERMS</span></p>
<p class="bqs">1. The Company will install on the Customer’s premises the above listed equipment and will maintain the equipment in good operating order and stocked with merchandise.</p>
<p class="bqs">2. The location of this equipment will be such as to permit accessibility to persons desiring use of same. This equipment shall remain the property of the Company and shall not be moved from the location at which installed, except by the Company.</p>
<p class="bqs">3. For equipment requiring electricity and water, the Customer is responsible for electrical receptacle and water outlet within ten (10) feet of the equipment location. The Customer is also responsible to supply the Electrical Power and Water needed.</p>
<p class="bqs">4. The Customer will exercise every effort to protect this equipment from abuse or damage.</p>
<p class="bqs">5. The Company will be responsible for all licenses and taxes on the equipment and sale of products.</p>
<p class="bqs">6. This Agreement–Contract is for a term of one (1) year from the date indicated herein and will be automatically renewed for a like period, unless thirty (30) day written notice is given by either party to terminate service.</p>
<p class="bqs">7. Commission on monthly sales will be paid by the Company to the Customer at the following rate: * * *.”</p>
<p class="indent">The rate provided in each of the agreements was “30% of Gross Receipts to $300.00 monthly[,] 35% over [$]300.00,” except for the agreement with Pizza of Gaithersburg, Inc., which called for “40% of Gross Receipts.”</p>
<p class="indent">We cannot regard the agreements as contracts for personal services. They were either a license or concession granted Virginia by the appellees, or a lease of a portion of the appellees’ premises, with Virginia agreeing to pay a percentage of gross <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page908" class="pagebreak">908</span>sales as a license or concession fee or as rent, and were assignable by Virginia unless they imposed on Virginia duties of a personal or unique character which could not be delegated.</p>
<p class="indent">The appellees earnestly argue that they had dealt with Macke before and had chosen Virginia because they preferred the way it conducted its business. Specifically, they say that service was more personalized, since the president of Virginia kept the machines in working order, that commissions were paid in cash, and that Virginia permitted them to keep keys to the machines so that minor adjustments could be made when needed. Even if we assume all this to be true, the agreements with Virginia were silent as to the details of the working arrangements and contained only a provision requiring Virginia to “install * * * the above listed equipment and * * * maintain the equipment in good operating order and stocked with merchandise.” We think the Supreme Court of California put the problem of personal service in proper focus a century ago when it upheld the assignment of a contract to grade a San Francisco street:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">All painters do not paint portraits like Sir Joshua Reynolds, nor landscapes like Claude Lorraine, nor do all writers write dramas like Shakespeare or fiction like Dickens. Rare genius and extraordinary skill are not transferable, and contracts for their employment are therefore personal, and cannot be assigned. But rare genius and extraordinary skill are not indispensable to the workmanlike digging down of a sand hill or the filling up of a depression to a given level, or the construction of brick sewers with manholes and covers, and contracts for such work are not personal, and may be assigned.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Taylor v. Palmer</span>, 31 Cal. 240 at 247–248 (1866).</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, the difference between the service the Pizza Shops happened to be getting from Virginia and what they expected to get from Macke did not mount up to such a material change in the performance of obligations under the agreements as would justify the appellees’ refusal to recognize the assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Restatement, Contracts, § 160(3) (1932) reads, in part:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Performance or offer of performance by a person delegated has the same legal effect as performance or offer of performance by the person named in the contract, unless,</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(a) performance by the person delegated varies or would vary materially from performance by the person named in the contract as the one to perform, and there has been no * * * assent to the delegation * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">In cases involving the sale of goods, the Restatement rule respecting delegation of duties has been amplified by Uniform Commercial Code § 2–210(6), which permits a promisee to demand assurances from the party to whom duties have been delegated.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page909" class="pagebreak">909</div>
<p class="indent">As we see it, the delegation of duty by Virginia to Macke was entirely permissible under the terms of the agreements. In so holding, we do not put ourselves at odds with <span class="italic">Eastern Advertising Co. v. McGaw</span>, for in that case, the agreement with the agency contained a provision that “the advertising cards were to be ‘subject to the approval of Eastern Advertising Company as to style and contents,’” which the court found to import that reliance was being placed on the agency’s skill, judgment and taste.</p>
<p class="indent">Having concluded that the Pizza Shops had no right to rescind the agreements, we turn to the question of damages.</p>
<p class="indent">[In an omitted portion of the opinion, the court finds that damages for lost profits might be able to be determined with reasonably certainty.]</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment reversed as to liability; judgment entered for appellant for costs, on appeal and below; case remanded for a new trial on the question of damages.</p>
<p id="sec469" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>

<p class="list_alpha">(1) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary, a contract term prohibiting assignment of “the contract” bars only the delegation to an assignee of the performance by the assignor of a duty or condition.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) A contract term prohibiting assignment of rights under the contract, unless a different intention is manifested,</p>
<p class="list_alpha1">(a) does not forbid assignment of a right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor’s due performance of his entire obligation;</p>

<p class="list_alpha">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), an assignment of a part of a right, whether the part is specified as a fraction, as an amount, or otherwise, is operative as to that part to the same extent and in the same manner as if the part had been a separate right.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) If the obligor has not contracted to perform separately the assigned part of a right, no legal proceeding can be maintained by the assignor or assignee against the obligor over his objection, unless all the persons entitled to the promised performance are joined in the proceeding, or unless joinder is not feasible and it is equitable to proceed without joinder.</p>
<p class="list_alphap">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="list_alphapi"><span class="italic">b. Partial Assignment.</span> The distinguishing feature of a partial assignment is a manifestation of intention to make an immediate transfer of part but not all of the assignor’s right, and to confer on the assignee a direct right against the obligor to the performance of that part. Historically, the right of a partial assignee could be enforced only by a suit in a court of equity, and it was therefore sometimes described as an “equitable” right. But the right of a total assignee also had historically an “equitable” character. Under the rule stated in Subsection (1), a partial assignment and a total assignment are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page911" class="pagebreak">911</span>equally effective, subject to the protection of the obligor under the rule stated in Subsection (2).</p>
<p id="sec472" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON PARTIAL ASSIGNMENT</span></p>
<p class="indent">An obligor may challenge the partial assignment of the obligation to a number of assignees on grounds that it substantially varies its undertaking. Instead of being able to discharge its obligation by one payment to one person or in one lawsuit, the obligor must now deal with a number of claimants. Since the assignor-obligee could bring only one action at common law to enforce its claim, the partial assignees could enforce their claims only by joining all interested parties in an equitable action. Under modern pleading rules, such as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, a partial assignee can maintain an action over the objection of the obligor only by joining all persons entitled to the promised total performance or, if joinder is not feasible, only if certain equitable criteria are met—for example, if relief can be shaped without the absent parties and if alternative remedies are not available.</p>
<p class="indent">This problem arises frequently in the construction industry. A general contractor may assign one part of a payment due from an owner to the contractor’s bank as security for operating loans to meet the payroll, another part to material suppliers, and yet another to subcontractors in payment for the work they do on the job. Normally, the owner will include a non-assignability clause in the construction contract in order to better control the contractor through the partial payments. Owners suspect that contractors may lose enthusiasm for a job if they can relieve themselves of pressing obligations by partial assignment of the right to payment. As § 322 of the Restatement, Second, Contracts indicates, general contractual prohibition of assignments of money claims are of limited efficacy. Traditional common law attitudes, hostile toward partial assignments, however, put the owner in a stronger position to prevent partial assignments without her consent.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the defenses of non-assignability by express or implied agreement or because of the nature of the duty “assigned,” the rights of the assignee are subject to any defenses the obligor might have had against the assignor under the assigned contract.</p>

<p id="sec474" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Larese v. Creamland Dairies</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, 1985.</p>
<p class="sectionb">767 F.2d 716.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>C</small>K<small>AY</small>, C. J…. Plaintiffs entered into a 10–year franchise agreement with defendant, Creamland Dairies, in 1974. The franchise agreement provided that the franchisee “shall not assign, transfer or sublet this franchise, or any of [the] rights under this agreement, without the prior written consent of Area Franchisor [Creamland] and Baskin Robbins, any such unauthorized assignment, transfer or subletting being null and without effect.” The plaintiffs attempted to sell their franchise rights in February and August of 1979, but Creamland refused to consent to the sales. Plaintiffs brought suit, alleging that Creamland had interfered with their contractual relations with the prospective buyers by unreasonably withholding its consent. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendant on the ground that the contract gave the defendant an absolute, unqualified right to refuse to consent to proposed sales of the franchise rights. Plaintiffs appeal, claiming that defendant franchisor has a duty to act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner when a franchisee seeks to transfer its rights under the franchise agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">The Colorado courts have never addressed the question of whether a franchisor has a duty to act reasonably in deciding whether to consent to a proposed transfer. The Colorado courts have, however, imposed a reasonableness requirement on consent to transfer clauses in other types of contracts. In <span class="italic">Basnett v. Vista Village Mobile Home Park</span>, the Colorado appellate court held that a landlord cannot unreasonably refuse to consent to assignment or subleasing by a tenant. While the court indicated that the courts would enforce a provision expressly granting the landlord an absolute <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page915" class="pagebreak">915</span>right to consent if such a provision was freely negotiated, it refused to find such an absolute right in a provision which provided simply that the landlord must consent to assignment. The question before us, therefore, is whether the Colorado courts would impose a similar requirement of reasonableness on restraint on alienation clauses in franchise agreements.</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel for both parties have argued that the franchisor-franchisee relationship is a special one which is not directly analogous to that of a landlord and tenant. As the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has noted, “[u]nlike a tenant pursuing his own interests while occupying a landlord’s property, a franchisee * * * builds the good will of both his own business and [the franchisor].” <span class="italic">Atlantic Richfield v. Razumic</span>. This aspect of the relationship has led a number of courts to hold that the franchise relationship imposes a duty upon franchisors not to act unreasonably or arbitrarily in terminating the franchise. As did these courts, we find that the franchisor-franchisee relationship is one which requires the parties to deal with one another in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants argue that the franchise assignment situation differs from the franchise termination situation in that the franchisor must work with the person to whom the franchise is assigned. To impose a duty of reasonableness, they argue, would violate the rule of <span class="italic">United States v. Colgate &amp; Co</span>, that a manufacturer engaged in private business has the right “freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.” This right, however, must be balanced against the rights of the franchisees. As is true in the termination cases, the franchisee has invested time and money into the franchise and, in doing so, has created benefits for the franchisor. We do not find it an excessive infringement of the franchisor’s rights to require that the franchisor act reasonably when the franchisee has decided that it wants out of the relationship. The franchisee should not be forced to choose between losing its investment or remaining in the relationship unwillingly when it has provided a reasonable alternative franchisee.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not hold that a provision which expressly grants to the franchisor an absolute right to refuse to consent is unenforceable when such an agreement was freely negotiated. We do not believe the Colorado courts would find such an absolute right, however, in a provision such as the one involved in this case which provides simply that the franchisee must obtain franchisor consent prior to transfer. Rather, the franchisor must bargain for a provision expressly granting the right to withhold consent unreasonably, to insure that the franchisee is put on notice. Since, in this case, the contracts stated only that consent must be obtained, Creamland did not have the right to withhold consent unreasonably.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="sec475" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Can Creamland avoid the outcome above in future contracts simply by modifying the wording of the non-assignment clause to include the sentence, “Creamland has the right to refuse consent to assignment of the franchise, reasonably or unreasonably”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Is it unreasonable for Creamland to object to assignment if it would have obtained fees from new franchisees that will be paid to Larese as consideration for assignment rather than to it, if assignment is permitted?</p>
<p id="sec476" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON RESTRICTIONS ON FRANCHISE ASSIGNMENTS</span></p>
<p class="indent">In relationships between franchisees and franchisors, “the franchisee’s ability to transfer or assign its franchise rights to a third party is a crucial element … . Most franchisors want as much control over the transfer process as possible while most franchisees want to convey their rights as freely as possible.” Terrence M. Dunn, <span class="italic">The Franchisor’s Control Over the Transfer of a Franchise</span>, 27 F<small>RANCHISE</small> L.J. 233, 233 (2008).</p>
<p class="indent">While courts impose certain standards on the franchisor’s ability to restrict the franchisee’s right to assign as a matter of general contract law, this power is also more directly and more stringently regulated by statute in certain industries. For example, the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2807, controls the termination and nonrenewal of franchises for gas stations notwithstanding the terms of the particular franchise agreement promulgated by the franchisor oil company. Similarly, most states, and to a lesser extent the federal government, regulate the power of automobile manufacturers to terminate, refuse to renew, or limit assignment under automobile dealer franchise agreements. In these industries, the economic power of the (often out-of-state or foreign) franchisor has been significantly circumscribed by legislation protecting politically influential local franchisees.</p>

<p class="indent">An obligor under a contract cannot free himself of his obligation by simply delegating his duty to another. If the rule were otherwise, it would be a handy device, indeed, for getting oneself out of debt.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page917" class="pagebreak">917</div>
<p class="indent">The right to receive payment can usually be assigned by a creditor without the consent of the party who is obligated to pay. Such an assignment cuts off the assigning creditor’s right to receive payment. Delegation of the duty to pay, in contrast, never cuts off the delegating obligor’s promissory duty, unless the creditor entitled to payment agrees that it will be a release. If such consent is not received, the delegation of duty creates a third-party beneficiary relationship. Recall Topic I in this Chapter. If the creditor does consent, in effect a new contract is formed between the original obligee and the third party delagatee; this transaction and its result are usually called a novation.</p>
<p id="sec478" class="noindent">R<small>ESTATEMENT</small>, S<small>ECOND</small>, C<small>ONTRACTS</small>:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 280. Novation.</span></h4>
<p class="blockquote">A novation is a substituted contract that includes as a party one who was neither the obligor nor the obligee of the original duty.</p>
<p class="list_alphap">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="list_alphapi"><span class="italic">b. Effect of novation.</span> A novation discharges the original duty, just as any other substituted contract does, so that breach of the new duty gives no right of action on the old duty. Most novations simply substitute a new obligor for an old obligor or, less commonly, a new obligee for an old obligee. Sometimes these are termed simple novations, to distinguish them from more complex transactions that are termed compound novations.</p>
<p class="list_alphapi"><span class="italic">d. Substitution of obligor.</span> A simple novation involving substitution of obligors results when an obligee promises the obligor that he will discharge the obligor’s duty in consideration for a third person’s promise to pay the obligee … A substitution of obligors may also result when an obligee promises a third person that he will discharge the obligor’s duty in consideration for the third person’s promise to render either the performance that was due from the obligor or some other performance. Even a promise to render part performance is consideration in that situation … [A] novation also results when a third person promises an obligor to assume, immediately and in substitution for the obligor’s duty, a duty to the obligee to render the performance that was due from the obligor or some other performance, and the obligee agrees with the obligor or with the third person to that situation. The third person then comes under a new duty to the obligee, who is an intended beneficiary of his promise to assume, and this is consideration for the obligee’s arrangement to discharge the original obligor … However, a mere promise by a third party to assume the obligor’s duty, not offered in substitution for that duty, does not result in a novation, and the new duty that the third party may owe to the obligee as an intended beneficiary is in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page918" class="pagebreak">918</span>addition to and not in substitution for the obligor’s original duty. For a novation to take place, the obligee must assent to the discharge of the obligor’s duty in consideration for the promise of the third party to undertake that duty.</p>

<p class="indent">The parties to a contract are bound to respect it in the sense that they are liable for damages or other judicial action if they breach. Beneficiaries or assignees may be granted the benefits or assume the obligations of the agreement. In these cases the parties to the agreement have chosen to deliberately expand their contractual community to encompass another. But sometimes strangers are obligated to respect the contract by not dealing with one of the parties in a manner inconsistent with that party’s duties under the agreement. If the interest of the party in the contract is like property, should it be entitled to compensation if a third party trespasses on its interests as it would if the stranger walked on its grass or converted its personal property? Is a potential employer foreclosed from hiring a skilled worker if the worker is under contract to another? Should the second employer be liable in damages to the first for its losses, or should the first employer be left to its remedies against the worker it contracted with? May a manufacturer sell goods to a buyer it knows has a long-term requirements contract with a competitor?</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">By creating a temporary island of stability in a fluid competitive system, the commercial contract protects the expectations which are necessary to all but the simplest competitive activity * * *. Despite Justice Holmes’ view that the payment of damages is an acceptable alternative to performance, the law’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page919" class="pagebreak">919</span>preference of performance to payment justifies deterring third parties from interference. * * *</p>

<p id="sec480" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Mitchell v. Aldrich</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Vermont Supreme Court, 1960.</p>
<p class="sectionb">122 Vt. 19, 163 A.2d 833.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ H<small>OLDEN</small>, J. The plaintiffs seek recovery for wrongful interference with contract relations. They claim the defendants deprived them of an advantageous agreement to purchase a herd of dairy cattle. The trial court withheld the case from the jury by directing a verdict of no liability. The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment for the defendants that was entered on this ruling.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to the sale of the cattle in question, the seller, William Comette, had procured several loans from the Chittenden Trust Company. His obligations were secured by mortgages on real and personal property. The chattel mortgage included farm machinery and the dairy herd, consisting of 102 cows. In August 1947 Comette decided to sell his entire herd and to this end obtained general permission from the mortgagee. He then called the plaintiff Mitchell, informed him of his intention to sell and sought to interest Mitchell in the purchase. The following morning, Mitchell and his associate, the plaintiff Albie, visited the Comette farm and inspected the cattle. After looking over the cattle, the plaintiffs made an offer to purchase the herd for $7,800. This offer was accepted by Comette. The terms of the sale provided for the payment of $100 at that time, $900 to be paid the following day and the balance of the purchase price became due on the removal of the cattle from Comette’s barn, in no event later than ten days hence. Comette informed the plaintiffs of the mortgage lien of the Chittenden Trust Company and it was understood by the buyers that approval of the bank was necessary to complete the transaction. Upon the payment of the $100, a written memorandum of the agreement was signed by Comette which set forth the terms of the sale and specified the sale was subject to the approval of the bank.</p>
<p class="indent">Comette communicated with his mortgagee on the same day and was advised by the bank that a Mr. Aldrich would call at his farm. The bank had made a prior arrangement with Aldrich to appraise the cattle which Comette sought to sell. It <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page920" class="pagebreak">920</span>appeared that the Chittenden Trust Company had from time to time called upon Aldrich to make such appraisals. Aldrich was not in the employ of the bank and received no compensation for making the valuations. After Comette’s telephone message on August 15, the bank requested Aldrich to make his appraisal right away.</p>
<p class="indent">The bank’s loan officer, responsible for servicing the Comette obligations, was called as a witness for the defendant Aldrich and gave this testimony concerning Aldrich’s authority:</p>
<p class="bqs">A. We asked Mr. Aldrich to make an appraisal of the cattle as to determine the value of them.</p>
<p class="bqs">Q. And did you ask him to do anything whatsoever in regard to the sale of them?</p>
<p class="bqs">A. Other than if he wanted to buy them he had that privilege.</p>
<p class="bqs">Q. And did you ask him, did you say anything to him in regard to interesting other people in regard to it?</p>
<p class="bqs">A. No, sir.</p>
<p class="indent">After telephoning the bank, Comette informed the plaintiffs that Aldrich had been sent to look at the cows. The plaintiffs went to Aldrich and informed him of their agreement to purchase the Comette cattle. Aldrich disclaimed any interest in the property but added that he would fulfill an appointment with Drew to look at the cattle.</p>
<p class="indent">When Aldrich and Drew arrived at the Comette farm, Comette informed them of his undertaking with the plaintiffs, and that he had received $100 in part payment of the price agreed upon. Aldrich replied by saying the plaintiff Mitchell was a “tough fellow to do business with and that I (Comette) probably would never get my money after the cows left the barn.” Aldrich went on to say that it would be impossible for Mitchell to get the bank’s approval of his purchase. Drew and Aldrich then offered Comette $8,100 for the herd and Aldrich stated there would be no doubt of the bank’s approval of that offer. Comette’s testimony continued to the effect that he relied on Aldrich’s statements for he believed him to be a representative of the bank.</p>
<p class="indent">The sale to Drew was completed with the approval of the mortgagee. Drew derived a net profit from the resale of the cattle. Aldrich received compensation from Drew for assistance in getting the cattle ready for auction.</p>
<p class="indent">Except for special justification, the law has long recognized liability against one who intentionally intrudes to disrupt an existing contract relation. The interest protected is the right of the individual to security in his business relations. He has a right to preserve the undertakings of persons with whom he has commercial dealings.</p>
<p class="indent">The remedy afforded is not restricted to definite and enforceable contracts. Protection is appropriate against unjustified interference with reasonable expectancies <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page921" class="pagebreak">921</span>of profit though the contract is terminable at will or unenforceable against the promisor in an adversary proceeding. The added element of a definite contract may be the basis for greater protection but it is not an essential requirement.</p>
<p class="indent">The promise of the seller, Comette, was a valid undertaking, made with proper reference to the security interest of his mortgagee in accordance with the requirement of 9 V.S.A. § 1763. The approval of the mortgagee, although not a certainty, was anticipated and expected. Save for the consent of the bank, the plaintiffs had a rightful interest in having the seller’s promise performed free from other outside interference which might make performance more difficult or impossible.</p>
<p class="indent">The purpose of the consent requirement was solely for the protection of the mortgagee. Clearly, if the loan was adequately safeguarded, the mortgagor was not at liberty to abrogate his promise to the buyer in order to gain a higher price. The seller’s promise remained in force until such time as it was disapproved for reasons connected with the impairment of the mortgagee’s interest.</p>
<p class="indent">There is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the defendants intruded upon this relationship to intercept the prospective gain for themselves by procuring a breach of the seller’s undertaking to the plaintiffs before the approval of the bank could be invoked. In any event, the seller broke away from his original undertaking with the plaintiffs and the evidence permitted the jury to conclude that Comette’s promise to the plaintiffs would have been fulfilled according to its terms had it not been for the participation of either or both of the defendants. It was for the jury to say whether the plaintiffs’ loss of the Comette agreement was caused by the defendants.</p>
<p class="indent">The next question is whether the interference was justified as a matter of law. If so the verdict directed by the court may be vindicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Justification for interference in the business relations of another is an affirmative defense, and the intruder has the burden of proving his privilege to intervene. Whether an occasion exists which justifies the invasion of another’s contract or business relations by the defendant is generally a question for the jury.</p>
<p class="indent">The law has crystallized relatively few concrete rules to determine the existence or want of privilege. All the circumstances must be analyzed and considered with reference to the type of relation disrupted, the means employed and the purpose of the actor’s interference.</p>
<p class="indent">It is only when the actor participated in the exercise of an absolute right equal or superior to the right invaded, that interference can be justified as a matter of law, and the issue withheld from the jury. Such a situation was found to prevail in <span class="italic">Raycroft v. Tayntor</span>. The defendant threatened to revoke a license to quarry, granted to the plaintiff’s employer, unless the employer terminated the plaintiff’s employment. The decision points out that the defendant was clothed with all the right and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page922" class="pagebreak">922</span>power of the owner of the quarry,—that it was the defendant’s right and privilege to determine who might remain at work there. The Court concluded that the defendant was acting in response to a right, equal or superior to that of the plaintiff and there could be no liability.</p>
<p class="indent">But there is no legal right to knowingly invade the contract relation of others solely to promote the intervenor’s financial interest. And an outsider, with knowledge of a sales agreement who prevents performance by offering a better price, may be held liable to the promisee who has suffered from the intervention. Thus the financial gain derived by the defendants from knowingly ousting the plaintiffs from their bargain with Comette, in itself affords no legal excuse.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants seek refuge in the authority conferred on the Chittenden Trust Company, by statute and contract, to disapprove the plaintiffs’ trade as justification for their interdiction of Comette’s engagement. The authority which Aldrich derived from the bank was restricted to appraising the Comette herd. There is nothing to indicate the privilege to veto the proposed sale of the mortgaged property was delegated to Aldrich. Herein lies the principal distinction between the facts of this appeal and those that controlled in <span class="italic">Raycroft v. Tayntor</span>. In the <span class="italic">Raycroft</span> case the privilege of interference was exercised by a defendant who was clothed with all the right and power of one legally justified to intrude.</p>
<p class="indent">It is the defendants’ position that the authority to interfere, although originally wanting, was supplied by ratification when the bank approved the sale to the defendant Drew. Whether the bank knowingly ratified the excessive acts of its appraiser in this instance is open to serious question. We are not required to settle that issue to dispose of this appeal. Even if it could be said that Aldrich acted with all the authority of the bank, the privilege of the bank to disrupt the agreement was not absolute, on the facts presented.</p>
<p class="indent">The mortgage from Comette to the bank transferred ownership of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee. However ownership of the mortgagee in the encumbered property is subject to the mortgagor’s equity and right to redeem. And here the mortgagee had fully recognized Comette’s right to redeem and had granted him general permission to offer the mortgaged property for sale. Comette’s undertaking with the plaintiffs was consistent with the mortgagee’s knowledge and permission, and subject to the mortgagee’s final approval.</p>
<p class="indent">The mortgagee’s right to defeat the proposed agreement to sell was limited by the nature of security required to protect the mortgage loan. In those instances where it might conclude by fair and honest judgment that the proposed sale would dissipate or jeopardize the security of the loan, a clear right to forbid the sale would exist. But where the integrity of the seller’s obligation would not be affected, the mortgagee has no absolute right to prohibit the sale or disrupt the bargain.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page923" class="pagebreak">923</div>
<p class="indent">The security available to the Chittenden Trust Company to protect Comette’s obligations was not limited to the dairy herd. The bank had a mortgage on other personal property, including farm machinery and a real estate mortgage as well. The extent of Comette’s indebtedness to the Chittenden Trust Company on the date of the proposed sale was not stated in the evidence. It does appear that the chattel mortgage was satisfied and discharged in 1957 by the payment of $6,692. Whether the proposed sale of the cattle to the plaintiffs at the price of $7,800 would imperil the mortgagee’s security in such a way as to justify the interference and disapproval by the bank’s proper representative framed an issue of fact in this controversy.</p>
<p class="indent">It was for the jury to say whether the defendants’ interference had the consequence of destroying Comette’s promise to the plaintiffs. If the jury reached an affirmative answer to this question, they were required to determine whether the defendants established that the occasion of their interference was authorized by the bank and justified by a present danger to the bank’s mortgage security.</p>
<p class="indent">The presence of these issues of fact required that the cause be submitted to the jury for decision. It was error to grant the defendants’ motion for verdict.</p>
<p class="indent">By the same token and for equivalent considerations the plaintiffs’ motion for verdict was properly denied. The plaintiffs’ assignment of error on this point is without merit.</p>

<p id="sec482" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Supreme Court, 1995.</p>
<p class="sectionb">11 Cal.4th 376, 902 P.2d 740, 45 Cal.Rptr.2d 436.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ A<small>RABIAN</small>, J….</p>
<p class="indent">John Della Penna, an automobile wholesaler doing business as Pacific Motors, brought this action for damages against Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., and its Lexus division, alleging that certain business conduct of defendants both violated provisions of the Cartwright Act, California’s state antitrust statute, and constituted an intentional interference with his economic relations. The impetus for Della Penna’s suit arose out of the 1989 introduction into the American luxury car market of Toyota’s Lexus automobile. Prior to introducing the Lexus, the evidence at trial showed, both the manufacturer, Toyota Motor Corporation, and defendant, the American distributor, had been concerned at the possibility that a resale market might develop for the Lexus in Japan. Even though the car was manufactured in Japan, Toyota’s marketing strategy was to bar the vehicle’s sale on the Japanese domestic market until after the American roll-out; even then, sales in Japan would only be under a different brand name, the “Celsior.” Fearing that auto wholesalers in the United States might re-export Lexus models back to Japan for resale, and concerned that, with production and the availability of Lexus models in the American market limited, re-exports would jeopardize its fledgling network of American Lexus dealers, Toyota inserted in its dealership agreements a “no export” clause….</p>
<p class="indent">Following the introduction into the American market, it soon became apparent that some domestic Lexus units were being diverted for foreign sales, principally to Japan. To counter this effect, Toyota managers wrote to their retail dealers, reminding them of the “no-export” policy and explaining that exports for foreign resale could jeopardize the supply of Lexus automobiles available for the United States market. In addition, Toyota compiled a list of “offenders”—dealers and others believed by Toyota to be involved heavily in the developing Lexus foreign resale market—which it distributed to Lexus dealers in the United States. American Lexus dealers were also warned that doing business with those whose names appeared on the “offenders” list might lead to a series of graduated sanctions, from reducing a dealer’s allocation to possible reevaluation of the dealer’s franchise agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">During the years 1989 and 1990, plaintiff Della Penna did a profitable business as an auto wholesaler purchasing Lexus automobiles, chiefly from the Lexus of Stevens Creek retail outlet, at near retail price and exporting them to Japan for resale. By late 1990, however, plaintiff’s sources began to dry up, primarily as a result of the “offenders list.” Stevens Creek ceased selling models to plaintiff; gradually other sources declined to sell to him as well.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page925" class="pagebreak">925</div>
<p class="indent">In February 1991, plaintiff filed this lawsuit against Toyota Motors, U.S.A., Inc., alleging both state antitrust claims under the Cartwright Act and interference with his economic relationship with Lexus retail dealers. At the close of plaintiff’s case-in-chief, the trial court granted Toyota’s motion for nonsuit with respect to the remaining Cartwright Act claim (plaintiff had previously abandoned a related claim—unfair competition—prior to trial). The tort cause of action went to the jury, however, under the standard BAJI instructions applicable to such claims with one significant exception. At the request of defendant and over plaintiff’s objection, the trial judge modified BAJI No. 7.82—the basic instruction identifying the elements of the tort and indicating the burden of proof—to require plaintiff to prove that defendant’s alleged interfering conduct was “wrongful.”</p>
<p class="indent">The jury returned a divided verdict, nine to three, in favor of Toyota. After Della Penna’s motion for a new trial was denied, he appealed. In an unpublished disposition, the Court of Appeal unanimously reversed the trial court’s judgment, ruling that a plaintiff alleging intentional interference with economic relations is not required to establish “wrongfulness” as an element of its prima facie case, and that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to have read the jury an amended instruction to that effect. The Court of Appeal remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial; we then granted Toyota’s petition for review and now reverse.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II—A</span></p>
<p class="indent">Although legal historians have traced the origins of the so-called “interference torts” as far back as the Roman law, the proximate historical impetus for their modern development lay in mid–19th century English common law. The opinion of the Queen’s Bench in <span class="italic">Lumley v. Gye</span> (1853) 2 El. &amp; Bl. 216, a case that has become a standard in torts casebooks, is widely cited as the origin of the two torts—interference with contract and its sibling, interference with prospective economic relations<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_169" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-169" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup>—in the form in which they have come down to us. The plaintiff owned the Queen’s Theatre, at which operas were presented. He contracted for the services of a soprano, Johanna Wagner, to perform in various entertainments between April 15 and July 15, with the stipulation that Miss Wagner would not perform elsewhere during that time without his permission.</p>
<p class="indent">In an action on the case, the theater owner alleged that Gye, the owner of a rival theater, knowing of the Wagner–Lumley agreement, “maliciously” interfered with the contract by “enticing” Wagner to abandon her agreement with Lumley and appear at Gye’s theater. Gye’s demurrer to the complaint was overruled by the trial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page926" class="pagebreak">926</span>court, a ruling that was affirmed by the justices of the Queen’s Bench on the then somewhat novel grounds that (1) “enticing” someone to leave his or her employment was not limited to disrupting the relationship between master and servant but applied to a “dramatic artiste” such as Miss Wagner, and (2) “wrongfully and maliciously, or, which is the same thing, with notice, interrupt[ing]” a personal service contract, regardless of the means the defendant employed, was an actionable wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">The opinion in <span class="italic">Lumley</span> dealt, of course, with conduct intended to induce the breach of an existing contract, not conduct intended to prevent or persuade others not to contract with the plaintiff. That such an interference with prospective economic relations might itself be tortious was confirmed by the Queen’s Bench over the next 40 years. In <span class="italic">Temperton v. Russell</span>, a labor union, embroiled in a dispute with a firm of builders, announced what today would be called a secondary boycott, intended to force a resolution of the union’s grievances by pressuring suppliers of the builder to cease furnishing him construction materials. A failure to comply with the union’s boycott demands, suppliers were warned, would result in union pressure on those who bought their supplies not to deal with them.</p>
<p class="indent">One such supplier of the builder, Temperton, sued the union’s leadership, alleging that his business had been injured by breaches of supply contracts and the refusal of others to do business with him, all as a result of the union’s threats. A unanimous Queen’s Bench upheld the jury’s verdict for the plaintiff, reasoning in part on the authority of <span class="italic">Lumley v. Gye</span>, that in the words of Lord Esher, the Master of the Rolls, “the distinction * * * between the claim for inducing persons to break contracts already entered into * * * and * * * inducing persons not to enter into contracts * * * can [not] prevail.”</p>
<p class="indent">“There was the same wrongful intent in both cases, wrongful because malicious,” Lord Esher wrote. “There was the same kind of injury to the plaintiff. It seems rather a fine distinction to say that, where a defendant maliciously induces a person not to carry out a contract already made with the plaintiff and so injures the plaintiff, it is actionable, but where he injures the plaintiff by maliciously preventing a person from entering into a contract with the plaintiff, which he would otherwise have entered into, it is not actionable.”</p>
<p class="indent">As a number of courts and commentators have observed, the keystone of the liability imposed in <span class="italic">Lumley</span> and <span class="italic">Temperton</span>, to judge from the opinions of the justices, appears to have been the “malicious” intent of a defendant…. While some have doubted whether the use of the word “malicious” amounted to anything more than an intent to commit an act, knowing it would harm the plaintiff, Dean Keeton, assessing the state of the tort as late as 1984, remarked that “[w]ith intent to interfere as the usual basis of the action, the cases have turned almost entirely upon the defendant’s motive or purpose and the means by which he has sought to accomplish <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page927" class="pagebreak">927</span>it. As in the cases of interference with contract, any manner of intentional invasion of the plaintiff’s interests may be sufficient if the purpose is not a proper one.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was, legal historians have suggested, this early accent on the defendant’s “intentionality” that was responsible for allying the interference torts with their remote relatives, intentional torts of a quite different order—battery, for example, or false imprisonment….</p>
<p class="indent">One consequence of this superficial kinship was the assimilation to the interference torts of the pleading and burden of proof requirements of the “true” intentional torts: the requirement that the plaintiff need only allege a so-called “prima facie tort” by showing the defendant’s awareness of the economic relation, a deliberate interference with it, and the plaintiff’s resulting injury. By this account of the matter—the traditional view of the torts and the one adopted by the first Restatement of Torts—the burden then passed to the defendant to demonstrate that its conduct was privileged, that is, “justified” by a recognized defense such as the protection of others or, more likely in this context, the defendant’s own competitive business interests.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the plaintiff’s initial burden of proof was such a slender one, amounting to no more than showing the defendant’s conscious act and plaintiff’s economic injury, critics argued that legitimate business competition could lead to time consuming and expensive lawsuits (not to speak of potential liability) by a rival, based on conduct that was regarded by the commercial world as both commonplace and appropriate. The “black letter” rules of the Restatement of Torts surrounding the elements and proof of the tort, some complained, might even suggest to “foreign lawyers reading the Restatement as an original matter [that] the whole competitive order of American industry is prima facie illegal.”</p>
<p class="indent">… Acknowledging [this] criticism, the American Law Institute discarded the prima facie tort requirement of the first Restatement. A new provision, section 766B, required that the defendant’s conduct be “improper,” and adopted a multifactor “balancing” approach, identifying seven factors for the trier of fact to weigh in determining a defendant’s liability. The Restatement Second of Torts, however, declined to take a position on the issue of which of the parties bore the burden of proof, relying on the “considerable disagreement on who has the burden of pleading and proving certain matters” and the observation that “the law in this area has not fully congealed but is still in a formative stage.” In addition, the Restatement Second provided that a defendant might escape liability by showing that his conduct was justifiable and did not include the use of “wrongful means.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page928" class="pagebreak">928</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II-B</span></p>
<p class="indent">[In this omitted portion of the opinion, the court reviewed the addition of a “wrongful,” “improper,” “illegal,” “independently tortious,” or some other variant element to the interference with economic relations tort in many other states.]</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">[In this omitted portion of the opinion, the court reviewed the development of the economic relations tort in California Supreme Court cases, paralleling the evolution in other jurisdictions, but not yet adding a “wrongful” conduct element.]</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, developments in the Court of Appeal and in the practical administration of such claims in the trial courts had, if anything, outdistanced our own formulations of the elements of the tort and the allocation of the burden of proof in at least two respects. First, several Court of Appeal opinions appeared to engraft onto the elements of the plaintiff’s cause of action allegations and proof that the defendant’s conduct was “wrongful” or, as the Court of Appeal said in <span class="italic">Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan &amp; Eisenberg</span>, was “based on facts that take the defendant’s actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.”</p>
<p class="indent">Second, in 1990, BAJI, the Book of Approved Jury Instructions widely used by trial judges in civil cases, relying on the Restatement Second of Torts and Mr. Witkin’s account of the tort, included an instruction providing that a defendant in an economic relations tort case could defeat liability by showing that its conduct was not independently “wrongful.”</p>
<p class="indent">These developments, of course, closely reflect a nearly concurrent change in views both within the American Law Institute and in other jurisdictions. In the face of those twin lines of development, we are thus presented with the opportunity to consider whether to expressly reconstruct the formal elements of the interference with economic relations tort to achieve a closer alignment with the practice of the trial courts, emerging views within the Court of Appeal, the rulings of many other state high courts, and the critiques of leading commentators. We believe that we should.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">In searching for a means to recast the elements of the economic relations tort and allocate the associated burdens of proof, we are guided by an overmastering concern articulated by high courts of other jurisdictions and legal commentators: The need to draw and enforce a sharpened distinction between claims for the tortious disruption of an existing contract and claims that a prospective contractual or economic relationship has been interfered with by the defendant….</p>
<p class="indent">The courts provide a damage remedy against third party conduct intended to disrupt an existing contract precisely because the exchange of promises resulting in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page929" class="pagebreak">929</span>such a formally cemented economic relationship is deemed worthy of protection from interference by a stranger to the agreement. Economic relationships short of contractual, however, should stand on a different legal footing as far as the potential for tort liability is reckoned. Because ours is a culture firmly wedded to the social rewards of commercial contests, the law usually takes care to draw lines of legal liability in a way that maximizes areas of competition free of legal penalties.</p>
<p class="indent">A doctrine that blurs the analytical line between interference with an existing business contract and interference with commercial relations less than contractual is one that invites both uncertainty in conduct and unpredictability of its legal effect. The notion that inducing the breach of an existing contract is simply a subevent of the “more inclusive” class of acts that interfere with economic relations, while perhaps theoretically unobjectionable, has been mischievous as a practical matter. Our courts should, in short, firmly distinguish the two kinds of business contexts, bringing a greater solicitude to those relationships that have ripened into agreements, while recognizing that relationships short of that subsist in a zone where the rewards and risks of competition are dominant.</p>
<p class="indent">Beyond that, we need not tread today. It is sufficient to dispose of the issue before us in this case by holding that a plaintiff seeking to recover for alleged interference with prospective economic relations has the burden of pleading and proving that the defendant’s interference was wrongful “by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.” …</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C<small>ONCLUSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">We hold that a plaintiff seeking to recover for an alleged interference with prospective contractual or economic relations must plead and prove as part of its case-in-chief that the defendant not only knowingly interfered with the plaintiff’s expectancy, but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Three of the twelve jurors found for Della Penna. To them, what was Toyota’s “wrongful” act? Is aggressive competition in a capitalist economy “wrongful”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What if Della Penna did not export any Lexuses back to Japan, and Toyota put Della Penna on the “offenders” list by accident? What if Toyota just didn’t like Della Penna and put him on the list for that reason? What if Della Penna did export <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page930" class="pagebreak">930</span>Lexuses to Japan until Toyota put him on the list and then Della Penna contritely went before the president of Toyota and swore on a stack of bibles that he would export no more, but Toyota would not take Della Penna off the “offenders” list?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Can Toyota dictate to their dealers to whom they may sell Lexuses? Can Toyota then refuse to allow its dealers to sell Lexuses in the South? Or in Detroit?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Recall the facts in <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span>, p. 13. Coastal Lumber Company buys the lumber that Southland was going to loan Best. What result if Best sues Coastal for tortious interference? What result if Coastal Lumber knew about the loan arrangement between Best and Southland? What result if Coastal was the secondary contractor on the Security Bank job and stood to take over the entire project if Best could not perform?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Suppose that Della Penna was in the process of negotiating a contract with Lexus of Stevens Creek, and a binding preliminary agreement (an agreement on all terms that require negotiation but which has not been completely formalized) was made before Toyota made threats of graduated sanctions against dealers that sold cars to those on the “offenders” list. Lexus of Stevens Creek stops selling Lexus cars to Della Penna. On what cause of action can Della Penna sue Toyota? What result? What if the negotiations had produced a binding preliminary commitment (an agreement with open terms but parties bound to continue negotiations with duty of good faith and fair dealing)? Same result?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. Suppose that Della Penna had a contract with the Lexus of Stevens Creek retail outlet to supply him with one hundred Lexus cars a year for a term of ten years before Toyota made its threats to take graduated sanctions against dealers selling to those on the “offenders” list. Lexus of Stevens Creek stops selling Lexus cars to Della Penna, and Della Penna sues Toyota for tortious interference with contract. What result?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">7</span>. The central question what is “wrongful” or “improper” in these situations is not easily determined. Consider the following disclaimer in the Restatement of Torts, before it attempts to define “improper”:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The tort of interference with existing or prospective contractual relations … is an intentional tort. It does not, however, fully fit the pattern for other intentional torts, especially those involving physical harm to person or property…. Initial liability depends upon the interplay of several factors and is not reducible to a single rule; and privileges, too, are not clearly established but depend upon a consideration of much the same factors. Moreover, there is considerable disagreement on who has the burden of pleading and proving certain matters, such, for example, as the existence and effect of competition for prospective business.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page931" class="pagebreak">931</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">This has occurred for two reasons. First, the law in this area has not fully congealed but is still in a formative stage. The several forms of the tort [(1) intentional interference with performance of a contract by third person, (2) intentional interference with another’s performance of his own contract, and (3) intentional interference with prospective contractual relation] are often not distinguished by the courts…. This has produced a blurring of the significance of the factors involved in determining liability. These factors are stated and described in § 767.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The second reason grows out of use of the term “malicious” in <span class="italic">Lumley v. Gye</span> (1853) and other early cases. It soon came to be realized that the term was not being used in a literal sense, requiring ill will toward the plaintiff as a requirement for imposing liability. Many courts came to call this “legal malice,” and to hold that in this sense the requirement means that the infliction of the harm must be intentional and “without justification.” “Justification” is a broader and looser term than “privilege,” and the consequence has been that its meaning has not been very clear….</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The word adopted for use in this Chapter, neutral enough to acquire a specialized meaning of its own for the purposes of the Chapter, is “improper.” … Each of [the three forms of this tort] provides that the interference must be improper. Section 767 specifies and analyzes the factors to be taken into consideration in determining whether the interference is improper, and must therefore be read and applied to each of the earlier sections. The determination of whether an interference is improper depends upon a comparative appraisal of these factors. And the decision is, whether it was improper under the circumstances—that is under the particular facts of the individual case, not in terms of rules of law or generalizations….</p>
<p class="noindent">R<small>ESTATEMENT</small>, S<small>ECOND</small>, T<small>ORTS</small>, Div. 9, Ch. 37, Introductory Note.</p>
<p class="indent">Does the California Supreme Court give us any direction on what is “wrongful” or “improper” in this case? How would you define “wrongful” or “improper” for the purposes of tortious interference?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">8</span>. Professor Harvey Perlman suggests “that the interference tort should be limited to cases in which the defendant’s acts are independently unlawful and that if improper motivation is to give rise to liability, it should be based only on objective indicia of activity producing social loss.” Perlman noted that in addition to tort law, courts have also relied on other sources to define the lawfulness of a defendant’s behavior. He supported the incorporation of such sources so that “the focus will be, as it should, on the economic effects of the defendant’s act.” In summing up his argument, he wrote:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page932" class="pagebreak">932</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Where the defendant’s act of interference is independently unlawful, tort objectives predominate; where the defendant’s behavior is lawful except for the resulting interference, tort theory should reflect and remain consistent with contract policies. In cases of unlawful acts, the issue is viewed more properly as the scope of liability for unlawful behavior; the interference tort, with its requirement that the defendant’s intention focus on the plaintiff’s relationship, provides a convenient method of limiting liability to a narrow range of economic harm. In cases of otherwise lawful acts, tort liability works at cross-purposes with contract policies. Contract remedies seem to promote efficiency, whereas the addition of inducer liability inhibits effective outcomes … By confining the tort to cases of independently unlawful acts or cases where improper motive can be discerned from objective facts, social welfare can be enhanced …</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">[A]doption of an unlawful means test has two advantages. First, it will reduce the number of cases that actually diverge from the analysis. Second, and perhaps more significantly, it will reduce the chilling effect that the current ambiguously stated doctrine must have on socially beneficial activity.</p>

<p class="indent">From the formation of Adler Barish in February, 1976, through March of the next year, appellees were salaried associates of Adler Barish.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_170" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-170" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> Appellees were under <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page933" class="pagebreak">933</span>the supervision of Adler Barish partners, who directed appellees’ work on cases which clients brought to the firm.</p>
<p class="indent">While still working for Adler Barish, appellees decided to form their own law firm and took several steps toward achieving their goal. They retained counsel to advise them concerning their business venture, sought and found office space, and early in March, 1977, signed a lease.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly before leaving Adler Barish, appellees procured a line of $150,000 from First Pennsylvania Bank. As security, appellees furnished bank officials with a list of eighty-eight cases and their anticipated legal fees, several of which were higher than $25,000, and together exceeded $500,000. No case on the list, however, was appellees’. Rather, each case was an Adler Barish case on which appellees were working.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellee Alan Epstein’s employment relationship with Adler Barish terminated on March 10, 1977.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_171" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-171" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup> At his request, Epstein continued to use offices of Adler Barish until March 19. During this time, and through April 4, when Adler Barish filed its complaint, Epstein was engaged in an active campaign to procure business for his new law firm. He initiated contacts by phone and in person, with clients of Adler Barish with open cases on which he had worked while a salaried employee. Epstein advised the Adler Barish clients that he was leaving the firm and that they could choose to be represented by him, Adler Barish, or any other firm or attorney.</p>
<p class="indent">Epstein’s attempt to procure business on behalf of the firm did not stop with these contacts. He mailed to the clients form letters which could be used to discharge Adler Barish as counsel, name Epstein the client’s new counsel and create a contingent fee agreement. Epstein also provided clients with a stamped envelope addressed to Epstein. Appellees Richard Weisbord, Arnold Wolf, and Sanford Jablon, who left Adler Barish on April 1, 1977, were aware of Epstein’s efforts to procure this business on behalf of their new firm and did not attempt to curtail them. Indeed, Weisbord and Wolf, upon leaving Adler Barish, also immediately began to seek business, as did Epstein, for the new firm. They too informed clients of Adler Barish of their plans and that the clients were free to discharge Adler Barish and retain Weisbord and Wolf in its stead. Their efforts continued until Adler Barish filed its complaint.</p>

<p class="blockquote">1. Nothing in this Final Decree shall be construed to preclude the defendants from announcing the formation of their new professional relationship in accordance with the requirements of DR 2–102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>
<p class="blockquote">2. Nothing in this Final Decree shall preclude those persons who, up to and including April 1, 1977, had active legal matters pending with and had been represented by the law firm of ADLER, BARISH, DANIELS, LEVIN and CRESKOFF from voluntarily discharging their present attorney and selecting any of the defendants, or any other attorney, to represent them.</p>
<p class="indent">The court concluded that appellees “engaged in illegal solicitation in complete and total disregard for the Code of Professional Responsibility” and thereby “tortiously interfered with the contractual and business relations that exist between Adler Barish and its clients.” It found equitable relief appropriate in view of appellees’ “avowed intentions * * * to continue their illegal solicitation.”</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed. In addition to granting Adler Barish’s petition for allowance of appeal, we granted a stay and expedited argument.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II. A<small>PPELLEES</small>’ C<small>ONSTITUTIONAL</small> C<small>LAIM</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The facts found by the court of common pleas, which appellees do not dispute and the Superior Court did not disturb, demonstrate that, while leaving Adler Barish, appellees made numerous contacts with Adler Barish clients on whose active cases appellees were working before leaving Adler Barish. Adler Barish argues that appellees’ conduct constitutes an intentional interference with existing contractual relationships between Adler Barish and its clients. According to Adler Barish, appellees’ conduct is “deserving of censure, not encouragement.” Appellees on the other hand, contend that their conduct was “privileged,” and that therefore no right of action for intentional interference lies. Moreover, they argue that their conduct is protected under the first and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page935" class="pagebreak">935</div>
<p class="blockquote">“[S]peech which does ‘no more than propose a commercial transaction’” is no longer outside the protection of the first and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States. <span class="italic">Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Consumer Council</span>. Accordingly, states are barred from imposing blanket prohibitions against truthful advertising of “routine” legal services. Such a blanket prohibition “serves to inhibit the free flow of commercial information and to keep the public in ignorance.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nothing in the challenged decree prohibited appellees from engaging in the truthful advertising protected under <span class="italic">Bates.</span> Appellees could inform the general public, including clients of Adler Barish, of the availability of their legal services, and thus the “free flow of commercial information” to the public is unimpaired. Moreover, the injunction expressly permitted appellees to announce “formation of their new professional relationship in accordance with the requirements of DR 2–102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.” Appellees therefore were permitted to mail announcements to “lawyers, clients, former clients, personal friends, and relatives.” This would include the very clients of Adler Barish whose business appellees sought.</p>
<p class="indent">What the injunction did proscribe was appellees’ “contacting and/or communicating with those persons who up to and including April 1, 1977, had active legal matters pending with and were represented by the law firm of ADLER, BARISH, DANIELS, LEVIN and CRESKOFF.” Our task is to decide whether the conduct of appellees is constitutionally subject to sanction.</p>
<p class="indent">The Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2–103(A) (as adopted, 1974), provides: “A lawyer shall not recommend employment, as a private practitioner, of himself, his partner, or associate to a non-lawyer who has not sought his advice regarding employment of a lawyer.” Appellees clearly violated this “proscription against self-recommendation.” They recommended their own employment, even though clients of Adler Barish did not seek appellees’ advice “regarding employment of a lawyer.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association</span>, makes plain that, after <span class="italic">Bates,</span> states may constitutionally impose sanctions upon attorneys engaging in conduct which violates these disciplinary rules, even though the conduct involves “commercial speech.” In <span class="italic">Ohralik,</span> the state bar association suspended an attorney who “solicited” persons injured in an automobile accident by making visits to the hospital room where the persons were recovering. Mr. Justice Powell, speaking for the Court, emphasized that commercial speech does not enjoy the same constitutional protections traditionally afforded other forms of speech….</p>
<p class="indent">Just as in <span class="italic">Ohralik,</span> appellees’ conduct frustrates, rather than advances, Adler Barish clients’ “informed and reliable decisionmaking.” After making Adler Barish clients expressly aware that appellees’ new firm was interested in procuring their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page936" class="pagebreak">936</span>active cases, Epstein provided the clients the forms that would sever one attorney-client relationship and create another. Epstein’s aim was to encourage speedy, simple action by the client. All the client needed to do was to “sign on the dotted line” and mail the forms in the self-addressed, stamped envelopes….<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_172" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-172" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Thus, appellees were actively attempting to induce the clients to change law firms in the middle of their active cases. Appellees’ concern for their line of credit and the success of their new law firm gave them an immediate, personally created financial interest in the clients’ decisions. In this atmosphere, appellees’ contacts posed too great a risk that clients would not have the opportunity to make a careful, informed decision. “[T]o reduce the likelihood of overreaching and the exertion of undue influence on lay persons; to protect the privacy of individuals; and to avoid situations where the lawyer’s exercise of judgment on behalf of the client will be clouded by his own pecuniary self-interest,” <span class="italic">Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association</span>, 436 U.S. at 461, we must reject appellees’ argument and conclude that, just as in <span class="italic">Ohralik,</span> the Constitution permits regulation of their conduct.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_173" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-173" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III. T<small>HE</small> R<small>IGHT OF</small> A<small>CTION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Thus, we turn to whether the court of common pleas properly concluded that Adler Barish is entitled to relief. In <span class="italic">Birl v. Philadelphia Electric Co.</span> (1960), this Court adopted Section 766 of Restatement of Torts and its definition of the right of action for intentional interference with existing contractual relations….</p>
<p class="indent">An examination of this case in light of Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 766, reveals that the sole dispute is whether appellees’ conduct is “improper.” There is no doubt that appellees intentionally sought to interfere with performance of the contractual relations between Adler Barish and its clients. While still at Adler Barish, appellees’ behavior, particularly their use of expected fees from Adler Barish clients’ cases, indicates appellees’ desire to gain a segment of the firm’s business. This pattern of conduct continued until the court of common pleas enjoined it. Indeed, appellees’ intentional efforts to obtain a share of Adler Barish’s business were successful. The record reveals that several clients signed the forms Epstein prepared <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page937" class="pagebreak">937</span>on behalf of appellees notifying Adler Barish that the clients no longer wished the services of Adler Barish. Likewise, the record reveals that Adler Barish and its clients were parties to valid, existing contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">In assessing whether appellees’ conduct is “improper,” we bear in mind what this Court stated in <span class="italic">Glenn v. Point Park College</span>, where we analyzed “privileges” in conjunction with the closely related right of action for intentional interference with prospective contract relations:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The absence of privilege or justification in the tort under discussion is closely related to the element of intent. As stated by Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, § 6.11: “* * * where, as in most cases, the defendant acts at least in part for the purpose of protecting some legitimate interest which conflicts with that of the plaintiff, a line must be drawn and the interests evaluated. This process results in according or denying a privilege which, in turn, determines liability.” What is or is not privileged conduct in a given situation is not susceptible of precise definition. Harper &amp; James refer in general to interferences which “are sanctioned by the ‘rules of the game’ which society has adopted”, and to “the area of socially acceptable conduct which the law regards as privileged” * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">We are guided, too, by Section 767 of Restatement (Second) of Torts, which focuses on what factors should be considered in determining whether conduct is “improper”:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In determining whether an actor’s conduct in intentionally interfering with an existing contract or a prospective contractual relation of another is improper or not, consideration is given to the following factors:</p>
<p class="blockquote">(a) The nature of the actor’s conduct,</p>
<p class="blockquote">(b) The actor’s motive,</p>
<p class="blockquote">(c) The interests of the other with which the actor’s conduct interferes,</p>
<p class="blockquote">(d) The interests sought to be advanced by the actor,</p>
<p class="blockquote">(e) The proximity or remoteness of the actor’s conduct to the interference and</p>
<p class="blockquote">(f) The relations between the parties.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_174" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-174" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page938" class="pagebreak">938</div>
<p class="indent">We find nothing in the “‘rules of the game’ which society has adopted” which sanctions appellees’ conduct. Indeed, the rules which apply to those who enjoy the privilege of practicing law in this Commonwealth expressly disapprove appellees’ method of obtaining clients. We find such a departure from “[r]ecognized ethical codes” “significant in evaluating the nature of [appellees’] conduct.” All the reasons underlying our Disciplinary Rules’ “proscription against [appellees’] self-recommendation,” especially the concern that appellees’ contacts too easily could overreach and unduly influence Adler Barish clients with active cases, are relevant here.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees’ conduct adversely affected more than the informed and reliable decisionmaking of Adler Barish clients with active cases. Their conduct also had an immediate impact upon Adler Barish. Adler Barish was prepared to continue to perform services for its clients and therefore could anticipate receiving compensation for the value of its efforts. Moreover, Adler Barish’s fee agreements with clients were a source of anticipated revenue protected from outside interference.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_175" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-175" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page939" class="pagebreak">939</div>
<p class="indent">It is true that, upon termination of their employment relationship with Adler Barish, appellees were free to engage in their own business venture. But appellees’ right to pursue their own business interests is not absolute. “[U]nless otherwise agreed, after the termination of the agency, the agent * * * has a duty to the principal not to take advantage of a still subsisting confidential relation created during the prior agency relation.” Restatement (Second) of Agency, § 396(d).</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees’ contacts were possible because Adler Barish partners trusted appellees with the high responsibility of developing its clients’ cases. From the position of trust and responsibility, appellees were able to gain knowledge of the details, and status, of each case to which appellees had been assigned. In the atmosphere surrounding appellees’ departure, appellees’ contacts unduly suggested a course of action for Adler Barish clients and unfairly prejudiced Adler Barish. No public interest is served in condoning use of confidential information which has these effects. Clients too easily may suffer in the end.</p>
<p class="indent">Order of the Superior Court reversed and court of common pleas directed to reinstate its final decree. Each party pay own costs.</p>

<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>ANDERINO</small>, J., dissenting….</p>
<p class="indent">One need not be a legal scholar to see the distinction for First Amendment purposes between the ambulance-chasing tactics used by the lawyer in <span class="italic">Ohralik</span> and the written communications which appellees mailed to the clients of Adler, Barish. The letters sent to prospective clients which would discharge Adler, Barish should the client sign on the dotted line contained no arm-twisting device pressuring clients to make an immediate response. Nor were these clients uninformed about the choices they could make in either retaining or discharging Adler, Barish as legal counsel. Additionally, appellees’ communication contained <span class="italic">no</span> false and misleading statements which would confuse, deceive, or mislead prospective clients. More importantly, appellees did not attempt to motivate these clients to stir up litigation as was done in <span class="italic">Ohralik.</span></p>
<p class="indent">This Court today misuses its injunctive powers to prohibit not only what is a protected form of direct solicitation under the First Amendment but to prohibit an attorney from truthfully informing a client about the client’s legal rights. The Order of the Superior Court should therefore be affirmed.</p>
<p id="sec485" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Client retains Attorney A to institute a lawsuit. Client loses confidence in Attorney A and consults Attorney B about the handling of the matter. Attorney B tells Client that she does not agree with the way that Attorney A is proceeding and further tells Client of his right to discharge his attorney without paying contract damages. Client discharges Attorney A and retains Attorney X. Attorney A sues Attorney B for interference with his contract. What result?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Seller confers with Attorney regarding a sales agreement he finds onerous to perform. Attorney advises Seller that contract breach is not a crime and that, under the rule of <span class="italic">Hadley v. Baxendale,</span> Buyer’s damages will be very limited and probably not worth the bother of litigation to collect. Seller breaches the agreement, and Buyer sues Attorney in tort for interference. What result? If Buyer has a valid claim, how will her damages be measured?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Don’t the clients of Adler, Barish have the right to terminate that relationship and hire a new lawyer? Is Epstein’s tort that he explained to the clients their legal rights?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Are the Restatement factors helpful in determining what is “improper”? Can you think of a better way?</p>

<p id="sec486" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Dowd and Dowd v. Gleason</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, First Division (2004).</p>
<p class="sectionb">816 N.E.2d 754, 352 Ill.App.3d 365.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ J<small>USTICE</small> O’M<small>ALLEY</small> delivered the opinion of the court:</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff, Dowd &amp; Dowd, Ltd. (Dowd), filed suit against Nancy J. Gleason and Douglas G. Shreffler (defendants), after they resigned as shareholders (partners) of Dowd and opened a new law firm, Gleason, McGuire and Shreffler (GMS). While working at Dowd, Nancy Gleason managed the Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) account. When the new firm was formed, Allstate moved its business to the new law firm. Dowd filed suit against defendants, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of employment contract, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and civil conspiracy.</p>
<p class="indent">The case was heard in a bench trial. In February 2001, the court entered a judgment in favor of Dowd and denied defendants’ mistrial motion. In March 2001, the court found that there was no reason to delay enforcement or appeal. Defendants now appeal.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">B<small>ACKGROUND</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Dowd &amp; Dowd is a law firm. In 1975 or 1976, Northbrook Excess and Surplus Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Allstate, retained Dowd for advice on insurance coverage of claims that were being made against Allstate’s policyholders for injuries arising from exposure to asbestos products. Nancy Gleason, one of the defendants here, joined Dowd in 1977 as an attorney and for the next 13 years became the primary person handling the Allstate account. Lynn Crim was the head of Allstate’s claims department and supervisor to George Riley, a manager in the claims department. Between 1987 and December 1990, Crim spoke with Nancy Gleason on a daily basis and spoke with Mike Dowd, the senior partner, “[r]arely.”</p>
<p class="indent">On August 7, 1990, Dowd paralegal Leslie Henkels met with Judy Gleason (an attorney at Dowd and wife of Douglas Shreffler), Nancy Gleason (an attorney and niece of principal partner Mike Dowd), and Maureen Henegan (a Dowd secretary). During that meeting, Judy Gleason indicated that Patrick Dowd (son of Mike Dowd) was being promoted to partnership status and that she and the others were leaving the firm. On or about September 25, there was a partners meeting and Patrick’s appointment was announced. Following the appointment of Patrick Dowd to partner, Nancy Gleason, Douglas Shreffler and Judith Gleason began investigating the possibility of establishing a new, separate law firm. They decided to take preliminary steps to form that firm and by December 1990, GMS had located office space, ordered furniture and equipment and initiated a banking relationship with the Harris Bank.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page943" class="pagebreak">943</div>
<p class="indent">On December 31, 1990, Nancy Gleason and Shreffler resigned from Dowd and with Philip McGuire and Judith Gleason, started the GMS law firm. On December 31, 1990, Nancy Gleason and Shreffler went to Mike Dowd’s home “in the late morning” to inform him of their resignations as officers and directors of Dowd. Crim of Allstate gave Gleason the charge of moving Allstate’s cases that were currently with Dowd to the new firm. Crim testified that he learned of Gleason’s new firm on December 31, 1990, “first thing in the morning.”</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">A<small>NALYSIS</small></span></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. S<small>TATUS OF</small> C<small>LIENTS</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants’ initial contention is that the trial court’s reasoning in the breach of fiduciary duty section of its order essentially reduces the status of clients to chattel and the decision deprives clients of their choice of counsel by prohibiting the mobility of lawyers. A full reading of the court’s written order shows that defendants’ assertion is an overstatement of the court’s findings and an exaggeration of the impact of those findings.</p>
<p class="indent">In its written order, the trial court discussed the broad guidelines regarding the standards and obligations used to determine whether a departing partner’s actions prior to leaving a firm constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. In citing an article from the Michigan Bar Journal (A. Goetz, <span class="italic">Break Away Lawyers,</span> 77 Mich. B.J. 1078 (1998)), the trial court noted that when attorneys leave a law firm to establish their own firm, it is appropriate to consider the clients as property of the firm and not property of the individual members of the firm. The trial court went on to explain that, accordingly, the lawyers may not solicit the firm’s clients on company time nor may they use the firm’s resources to establish their own, competing firm, particularly until proper notice has been given. While defendants were free to set up a new law firm, the question became whether any of the steps taken in connection with such action breached the fiduciary duty that the defendants owed to Dowd. On the other hand, the current firm has a duty not to interfere with the departing attorneys’ continued right to practice law. The trial court noted that it is not improper for the lawyer to notify the client of his impending departure provided that he makes it clear that legal representation is the client’s choice. In our view, the court’s discussion encourages departing attorneys to give clients an informed choice as to who will manage their business in light of changes in employment or business structure. The court’s order also reminds current firms to allow attorneys to move freely without hindrance from them.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, the supreme court noted in its review of this matter that the case law supports the view that while lawyers who are planning to leave a firm may take preliminary, logical steps of obtaining office space and supplies, they may not solicit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page944" class="pagebreak">944</span>clients for their new venture. <span class="italic">Dowd,</span> 181 Ill.2d at 475 (citing <span class="italic">Graubard Mollen Dannett &amp; Horowitz v. Moskovitz</span> (N.Y.1995). The <span class="italic">Graubard</span> court noted:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“‘[A]s a matter of principle, preresignation surreptitious “solicitation” of firm clients for a partner’s personal gain * * * is actionable. Such conduct exceeds what is necessary to protect the important value of client freedom of choice in legal representation, and thoroughly undermines another important value-the loyalty owed partners (including law partners), which distinguishes partnerships (including law partnerships) from bazaars.’”</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants here rely on <span class="italic">Corti v. Fleishe</span> (1981), an inapposite case, for the proposition that clients may not be reduced to chattel. The appellate court in <span class="italic">Corti</span> held that the employment agreement there, which provided for the transfer of client files from defendants to plaintiff without permission from clients, was void and contrary to public policy in that it deprived clients of the right to be represented by counsel of their own choice. The <span class="italic">Corti</span> case is inapposite because that case dealt with a written agreement to transfer clients’ files without permission from clients. In the instant case, there is no such agreement, oral or written. Here, we are dealing with the alleged improper solicitation of Dowd’s largest client and the duty defendants owed to their former firm.</p>
<p class="indent">We are by no means asserting that clients of a law firm are the property of the firm in terms of “chattel,” but we are reaffirming the tenet that preresignation solicitation of firm clients for a partner’s personal gain is a breach of the partner’s fiduciary duty to the firm.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II. B<small>REACH OF</small> F<small>IDUCIARY</small> D<small>UTY</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The supreme court opinion in this case’s procedural history noted that “[t]his is a fact-intensive inquiry, and on remand the finder of fact will have to resolve a number of factual disputes before determining whether the defendants breached their fiduciary duty.” <span class="italic">Dowd,</span> 181 Ill.2d at 477, 230 Ill.Dec. 229, 693 N.E.2d 358.</p>
<p class="indent">On remand, the trial court made several findings of fact as to defendants’ breach of fiduciary duty to Dowd. Some of those findings included: failing to disclose certain facts that threatened the economic existence of Dowd, such as obtaining a $400,000 line of credit and $100,000 checking account from Harris Bank using Dowd’s confidential information; paying down more than $186,000 of Dowd’s line of credit to American National Bank without authorization, in order to present a better financial statement for themselves when obtaining a line of credit for GMS; soliciting Allstate’s business prior to resigning from Dowd; arranging for a mass exodus of firm employees prior to December 31, 1990; downloading Allstate case service lists and mailing labels for substitution of counsel; and using of confidential information.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page945" class="pagebreak">945</div>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">A. Pretermination Solicitation</span></p>
<p class="indent">One of the major questions in this case was whether defendants solicited Allstate as a client for their new firm before they left Dowd, thereby breaching their fiduciary duty to the firm. Defendants assert that Dowd’s proof of solicitation was based on allegations of obtaining office space, credit, and equipment and using Dowd resources, all of which the Illinois Supreme Court has already deemed proper.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court in the instant case observed that in Illinois, the breach of fiduciary duty among law partners has often been examined in connection with business partners. For instance, in <span class="italic">Dowell v. Bitner</span> (1995), the appellate court there noted that “employees may plan, form and outfit a competing corporation while still working for the employer, but they may not commence competition.” (Emphasis is omitted.) Further, former employees may compete with their former corporate employer and solicit former customers as long as there was no business activity prior to termination of employment. Although the Illinois Supreme Court pointed out that lawyers are not bound by the same fiduciary duties as those of nonlawyer corporate officers and directors, the principles are similar. In its review of this case, the supreme court found the following comments from <span class="italic">Graubard,</span> a New York Court of Appeals case, relevant: secretly attempting to lure firm clients to the new association, lying to partners about plans to leave, and abandoning the firm on short notice and taking clients and files would not be consistent with a partner’s fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="indent">One item of evidence that supports a finding of breach of fiduciary duty based on pretermination solicitation in this case is Leslie Henkels’ testimony. Henkels, a former legal assistant/paralegal at Dowd, testified that she was told in mid-December 1990 by Nancy Gleason that GMS had secured the Allstate business for the new firm. The trial court found her testimony to be credible. Ultimately, it is for the trial judge to determine the credibility of the witnesses, to weigh the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom, and to resolve any conflicts in the evidentiary record.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court also relied on the testimony of Leslie Henkels regarding the events of December 31, 1990. Henkels testified that on December 31, 1990, shortly before noon, Nancy Gleason called her and told her that she was faxing a letter to her to be put on the desks of the partners at Dowd. Henkels recalled that the letter was on Allstate letterhead and signed by George Riley. Nancy Gleason called back shortly thereafter and told Henkels to retrieve the faxes and destroy them, on the advice of “their counsel.” Nancy then called a third time indicating that she was on her way to Mike Dowd’s house to resign. The time between the first call and the third call was approximately 30 to 45 minutes. When shown Nancy Gleason’s resignation letter at trial, Henkels stated that the letter was not the document she received via fax from Nancy and had not seen it before.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page946" class="pagebreak">946</div>
<p class="indent">In contrast, Nancy Gleason testified that she told Henkels that she was sending a fax, but testified that it was not a fax from Allstate. She stated that it was her letter of resignation. Nancy testified that after speaking with Mike Dowd on December 31, 1990, she proceeded to the Allstate offices. Nancy Gleason recalled telling Crim and Riley that a new firm was being formed and certain associates would be extended offers.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court expressly believed Henkels version of the December 31 events, including the content of the letter, and we will not disturb such a finding of credibility.</p>
<p class="indent">Timothy Nolan, an attorney that began working for GMS in July or August 1991, testified that Virginia Vermillion, an associate at Dowd prior to December 31, who joined GMS in January 1991, told him that Nancy Gleason had George Riley’s commitment long before defendants left Dowd and that “they had a lock on the business long before they left.” Nolan further testified that Vermillion told him that they were able to transfer the files so easily because, “[w]e knew which files were coming. We knew which attorneys were coming. We knew who was coming.”</p>
<p class="indent">At trial, Virginia Vermillion denied telling Timothy Nolan that she knew about the new firm before January 1, 1991, or that defendants solicited the Allstate business prior to December 31. She also testified that she did not tell William Kreese, a candidate for an associate position at Dowd, that he was actually interviewing for the new law firm.</p>
<p class="indent">Another item of evidence that supports the finding of pretermination solicitation is the November 1990 credit memorandum created by David J. Varnerin, a relationship manager in the private banking group at Harris Bank. The November 28, 1990, memorandum that Varnerin prepared for his supervisors indicated that “[d]iscussions have been held with their principal client Allstate. The firm has been assured that their invoices will be paid promptly within 30 days. And, since the firm will have the prior firm’s office administrator, we can reasonably assume that bills will be generated and sent in a very prompt manner.” Also in the memorandum, business reference D. Paterson Gloor told Varnerin that “Nancy Gleason’s group has a real lock on the Allstate business and he believes this client relationship will last for years.” The reasonable inference from Varnerin’s memorandum is that defendants made contact with and solicited Allstate’s business prior to resigning from Dowd. Circumstantial evidence will suffice whenever an inference may reasonably be drawn therefrom.</p>
<p class="indent">We note that the supreme court stated in its prior opinion in this case that departing lawyers are permitted to prepare lists of clients <span class="italic">expected to leave the firm</span> and obtain financing based on the lists. That expectation is distinctly different from what happened in this case, where the evidence leads to the reasonable inference that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page947" class="pagebreak">947</span>partners actually solicited the Allstate business, secured a commitment from Allstate for future business and obtained financing based on that commitment, not a mere expectation.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, Lynn Crim and George Riley both testified that they had not been solicited by defendant to move their business to the new firm prior to Nancy Gleason’s resignation. As stated earlier, it is for the trial judge to determine the credibility of the witnesses, to weigh the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom, and to resolve any conflicts in the evidentiary record. Thus, we affirm the court’s finding that Dowd met its burden of showing that defendants breached their fiduciary duty to Dowd by soliciting Allstate prior to the termination of their employment contracts.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">B. Manner of Leaving Dowd</span></p>
<p class="indent">Although we have found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that defendants breached their fiduciary duty by committing pretermination solicitation, the evidence in the instant case also supports a finding that defendants breached their fiduciary duty in the manner in which they left Dowd.</p>
<p class="indent">The court held that “voting and accepting large bonuses for themselves and their friends and family without disclosure that they would be leaving and again stripping D &amp; D of cash reserves” was a breach of defendants’ fiduciary duty to Dowd. This was evidenced by Nancy Gleason’s testimony that she received a $62,500 bonus in October 1990 based on August 1990 discussions with the other shareholders/partners to issue bonuses and a $100,000 bonus on or about December 21, 1990, despite her plans to leave Dowd on December 31, 1990. The evidence also demonstrated that defendants’ discussions of forming the new firm also began in August 1990. Therefore, the court’s decision to include bonuses in its award to Dowd is not an abuse of discretion. Even though we may have held differently in light of the testimony that bonuses were based, in part, on past performance and service to the firm, a reviewing court will not overturn a circuit court’s findings merely because it does not agree with the lower court or because it might have reached a different conclusion had it been the trier of fact.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court here also held that defendants breached their fiduciary duty by arranging for the mass exodus of firm employees before December 31, 1990. See <span class="italic">Veco Corp. v. Babcock</span> (1993) (held that actions constituted breach of fiduciary duty where defendants secretly solicited Veco employees for new company and orchestrated a mass exodus following defendants’ resignation). This was evidenced by the matching of Dowd associates who eventually joined GMS and the furniture invoice providing the names of the persons using the new furniture created prior to defendants’ resignations. The evidence regarding the premade furniture labels leads to the reasonable inference that defendants went so far as to solicit many Dowd attorneys <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page948" class="pagebreak">948</span>who worked on the Allstate files to leave Dowd prior to their resignation. Additionally, paralegal Leslie Henkels testified that on the evening of December 31, she received a call from Judy Gleason asking her to join the firm-though it was “basically a formality since I had already been asked to join the firm months before.” The circuit court’s determination is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court here heard ample amounts of testimony as to defendants’ actions prior to their resignation and based on that testimony and its credibility assessments, the court determined that the manner in which defendants left Dowd was improper and a breach of their fiduciary duty. We will not disturb those determinations. A reviewing court may not overturn a trial court’s findings merely because it does not agree with the lower court or because it might have reached a different conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants here also contend that the trial court’s finding that defendants were competing with Dowd “in their own minds” before resignation has no support in the record. Defendants are referring to the portion of the trial court’s written order that stated:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“* * *The evidence shows that <span class="bold"><span class="italic">in their own minds</span></span>, the firm of GMS was in business prior to the date of resignation as shown from the employer identification number application and the Professional Liability Insurance Policy Declarations effective 12/1/90, which listed 14 D &amp; D employees for GMS, as well as the revenue projections to Harris Bank.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="indent">The December 1, 1990, start date for GMS’s professional liability insurance, compared to defendants’ December 31, 1990, actual resignation date, supports the trial court’s finding. Even if this finding was not supported by the record, as a reviewing court, we can sustain the decision of a lower court on any grounds that are called for by the record, regardless of whether the lower court relied on those grounds and regardless of whether the lower court’s reasoning was correct. Here, we have already affirmed the trial court’s finding that defendants breached their fiduciary duty to Dowd by soliciting Allstate’s business prior to their resignation and the trial court’s breach of fiduciary duty decision may stand on that finding alone.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">C. Use of Confidential Information</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants also assert that the court’s finding as to the use of confidential information is “flatly contradicted” by the record and the court never identifies what was considered “confidential information.” The trial court, however, specifically states that it was a breach of fiduciary duty when “Nancy Gleason and Douglas Shreffler breached the agreement not to use confidential information, time and billing information and information from the financial statements of D &amp; D for their own personal gain.” In its order, the trial court cites the testimony of Maureen Gleason as evidence of defendants’ use of confidential information.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page949" class="pagebreak">949</div>
<p class="indent">Maureen Gleason testified, as an adverse witness, that in late October 1990 she and her husband prepared a projected profit and loss statement<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_176" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-176" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> for the new firm, with a start date of November 1990. It was prepared for submission to three banks, including Harris Bank. Maureen said that the unspecified associates listed therein were based on a projection of the number of associates GMS needed “to handle the business that [they] hoped to get,” but no specific associates were in mind. She stated that the estimated 2,250 billable hours per associate was based on the average expectancy at law firms. She explained that the experience level and billable hours expectancy descriptions of the unspecified associates was based on who they “hope[d] to bring with [them] if [they] left.” Though she had access to confidential information like this, Maureen denied using Dowd’s confidential information to obtain GMS’ projected figures. Maureen testified that the figures were based upon numerous publications that indicated what was the accepted amount of billable hours for associates.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court believed that confidential information was in fact used to defendants’ benefit in creating this projection. However, the Illinois Supreme Court stated in its prior opinion in this case that departing lawyers are permitted to prepare lists of clients expected to leave the firm and obtain financing based on the lists. Therefore, the trial court’s finding is in error. Nonetheless, the finding of breach of fiduciary duty is supported on other grounds and does not change the outcome of this case.</p>
<p class="indent">The court also found that it was an improper use of confidential information for defendants to make payments to Dowd’s line of credit with American National Bank to secure its own line of credit without authorization to do so. Defendants assert that David Varnerin, Dowd’s witness, obviated such a claim and thus, the court’s decision is unfounded. Varnerin testified that in considering the application for a line of credit with Harris Bank, he did not inquire as to whether Dowd’s line of credit obligation had been paid off and affirmed that the decision to approve defendants’ line of credit was independent of that obligation. However, Kenneth Gurber, a nondeparting partner at Dowd, testified that under normal circumstances, he would have been consulted about the American National Bank payoff, but was not, and Maureen Gleason did not have the authority to write a check for $187,000 without approval from the board of directors. Because credibility and conflicts in testimony are for the fact finder to determine, we leave the credibility assessment at the discretion of the trial court. The court was in the best position to determine whether it believed that Varnerin used the payoff information in his evaluation. Regardless of whether the court considered the payoff, the evidence demonstrates that defendants used confidential information and covert action to pay off this line of credit. As guarantors of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page950" class="pagebreak">950</span>Dowd’s line of credit, paying the sum off would make them more attractive to Harris Bank officials in the position to extend a line of credit to them for the new firm.</p>
<p class="indent">There was also ample evidence of defendants’ use of Dowd confidential records in preparation for taking Allstate with them to the new firm. Leslie Henkels testified that between August 1990 and December 31, 1990, she was directed by either Judy Gleason, Maureen Gleason or Maureen Henegan to update the service lists in order to move the Allstate business to GMS. On December 28, 1990, Henkels made sure that the service lists were up to date and the mailings lists were with them so that they could notify counsel of substitution of attorney. On December 31, 1990, between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., Henkels took the service list binders to GMS’s offices, at the instruction of Doug Shreffler.</p>
<p class="indent">Mary Judson, a former Dowd legal secretary, testified that on December 28, 1990, prior to defendants’ resignations, she was instructed by Leslie Henkels and Maureen Henegan to update and download the Allstate service lists and mailing labels to disks. She was told that the project had to be completed that day.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, Maureen Henegan (Nancy Gleason’s secretary at Dowd and GMS) testified that she did not instruct anyone at Dowd to update service lists so that they may taken to the new firm. In light of the conflicting testimony, we will not disturb the fact finder’s decision as to the credibility of these witnesses. <span class="italic">Kalata v. AnheuserBusch Co.</span> (1991). Moreover, the court’s finding of use of confidential information is well supported by the record.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III. T<small>ORTIOUS</small> I<small>NTERFERENCE</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">In focusing on the conduct of the defendants, the trial court here determined that Dowd proved defendants’ actions constituted tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage. We agree, as shown below in our discussion of each element. Defendants, however, assert that the trial court’s personal assertions of business expectations prejudiced their case and, further, that the trial court had no evidence that Dowd had a valid business expectation that they would be the recipient of Allstate’s business after Nancy Gleason’s departure.</p>
<p class="indent">To establish a cause of action for the tort of intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage, Illinois law requires that the following four elements must be proven: (1) the existence of a valid business relationship or expectancy; (2) the defendants’ knowledge of plaintiff’s relationship or expectancy; (3) purposeful interference by the defendants that prevents the plaintiff’s legitimate expectancy from ripening into a valid business relationship or termination of the relationship; and (4) damages to plaintiff resulting from such interference.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">A. Existence of a Valid Business Relationship or Expectancy</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants contend that Dowd did not offer any evidence that it had an expectancy to keep Allstate’s business after the departure of Gleason and reminds this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page951" class="pagebreak">951</span>court that the relationship between an attorney and his client is terminable at will. While this is true, until terminated, the relationship created by an at-will contract will presumptively continue in effect so long as the parties are satisfied, and, therefore, such a relationship is sufficient to support an action for tortious interference.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that the relationship between an attorney and her client is terminable at will does not of itself defeat an action for tortious interference because the action is not dependent upon an enforceable contract but, rather, upon an existing relationship. Until terminated, the relationship created by a contract terminable at will is subsisting and will presumptively continue in effect so long as the parties are satisfied. Such a relationship is sufficient to support an action for tortious interference.</p>
<p class="indent">The focus here is not on the conduct of the client in terminating the relationship, but on the conduct of the party inducing the breach or interfering with the expectancy. Moreover, to prevail on the claim, a plaintiff must show not merely that the defendant has succeeded in ending the relationship or interfering with the expectancy, but “ ‘purposeful interference,’ “ meaning the defendant has committed some impropriety in doing so. <span class="italic">Dowd</span> (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766B, Comment <span class="italic">a</span> (1979) (“‘In order for the actor to be held liable, this Section requires that his interference be improper’”).</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants assert that the trial court had no evidence that Dowd had a valid business expectation that it would be the recipient of Allstate’s business after Nancy Gleason’s departure. They complain that following Dowd’s objection during trial, George Riley from Allstate was not allowed to testify that the 200 files handled by Nancy Gleason at Dowd would have gone with her had she been fired by Dowd. We first note that a trial court’s ruling on an objection to evidence will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="indent">The question posed to Riley during trial was: “If Mike Dowd had fired Nancy Gleason in 1990, would you have left the files that she was working on for you with Mike Dowd?” Following an objection, the court stated that the answer would call for speculation. Defense counsel argued that it spoke to the “missing gap” in Dowd’s reasonable expectation issue. The court then allowed counsel to ask a series of questions of Riley as an offer of proof. Riley was asked what effect Nancy Gleason’s termination would have had on the handling of Allstate’s files. Riley responded, “Disaster,” because “Nancy was an integral part of this operation.” Riley was also asked if he would have allowed the 200 Allstate files to remain at Dowd absent Nancy Gleason, to which he answered, “No.”</p>
<p class="indent">Riley’s answers, in defendants’ view, would support the conclusion that Dowd did not have a legitimate expectancy of continued business in the event that Gleason left Dowd. We find it important that there was no evidence that Dowd had any indication from Riley prior to December 31, 1990, that its continued business relationship was dependent upon Nancy Gleason’s continued employment with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page952" class="pagebreak">952</span>Dowd. Even if Dowd had that understanding, Dowd was unaware of Nancy Gleason’s intention to leave the firm. There was also no indication that Allstate was in any way dissatisfied with the services received from Dowd. More importantly, as we have already affirmed the finding that defendants succeeded in ending the relationship, their “purposeful interference” was committed in an unseemly manner. In our view, the trial court’s order does not offend the well-established rule that a client may discharge an attorney at any time, for any reason, or for no reason.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">B. Knowledge of Plaintiff’s Relationship or Expectancy</span></p>
<p class="indent">Dowd enjoyed a 15-year business relationship with Allstate. As partners and shareholders, defendants were undeniably aware of this relationship and its lucrative benefit to Dowd.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">C. Purposeful Interference</span></p>
<p class="indent">Support for the trial court’s purposeful-interference finding is found within the breach of fiduciary duty discussion of this opinion. Defendant’s actions, or “impropriety” as the trial court put it, established a purposeful interference with Dowd’s prospective economic advantage. The reasonable inference from the evidence discussed earlier and the court’s credibility findings demonstrate that defendants covertly solicited the Allstate account prior to terminating their employment with Dowd. The covert steps taken by Nancy Gleason, Shreffler and GMS, individually and collectively, seemingly caused Dowd’s largest client to make a commitment to cease doing business with Dowd. Defendants’ actions, in the trial court’s view, prevented Dowd from enjoying a continuing relationship with Allstate and, more importantly, precluded Allstate from having a free and unfettered choice regarding keeping its business with Dowd. Cases have recognized that pretermination solicitation of clients by members of an existing firm for the benefit of a new firm rises to a breach of a fiduciary duty.</p>
<p class="indent">There was no evidence introduced, for example, that Dowd was given any time to attempt to salvage its long-standing business relationship. If given the opportunity, Allstate may have remained with Dowd if offered more attractive fee arrangements (no fees for research, no second chairs at trial, and lower hourly rates are usually accorded government bodies). The latter, in the long run, might have proven more appealing to this insurer than simply having only Gleason in charge of their files. However, due to the secretiveness and abruptness of defendants’ ultimate departure, the securing of the Allstate business was a feat accomplished at least by January 1, if not months earlier as the trial court believed. This alone represents some interference with Dowd’s legitimate business expectation vis-a-<span class="italic">vis</span> Allstate and more importantly, casts doubt on how free and unfettered Allstate’s decision to leave Dowd really was, absent a viable and familiar alternative (continuing to do <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page953" class="pagebreak">953</span>business with Dowd at more advantageous terms). It also renders the pronouncements of Riley and Crim, as the trial court said, closer to speculation than fact, as they insist.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants contend that the trial court ignored the testimony of the Allstate representatives, Crim and Riley, that they were not aware of the new firm prior to December 31 and unjustifiably credited the conflicting testimony of former Dowd paralegal Leslie Henkels that she was told that defendants had secured Allstate’s commitment prior to December 31. Defendants also disagreed with the court’s reliance on GMS associate Timothy Nolan’s testimony that Virginia Vermillion told him that Allstate’s commitment was secured before defendants’ resignations. However, these contentions are based on credibility assessments. Absent a showing of an abuse of its discretion, we will not reverse a trial court’s determination on the issue.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, we hold that the trial court’s purposeful-interference finding is supported by the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">D. Damages</span></p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">1. Compensatory Damages</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants also assert that because Riley from Allstate testified that Allstate would have followed Gleason in any event there can be no damages. A plaintiff must prove damages to a reasonable degree of certainty, and evidence cannot be remote, speculative, or uncertain. The trial court specifically held that “Plaintiff has proved damages with a reasonable degree of certainty.” Even when the appellate court would have been better satisfied with different findings, we generally will not interfere with a trial court award supported by the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the compensatory damages award against Nancy Gleason, Douglas Shreffler and GMS for count III (tortious interference with prospective economic advantage) in the amount of $2,464,889.46, was based on the evidence presented by Dowd’s damages opinion witness, Todd Lundy. Lundy is a certified public accountant. The trial court specifically found that the evidence presented by Lundy, including his report, established certain damages. In preparing his report, Lundy testified that he read the pleadings, depositions, various financial documents from Dowd (such as paid bills, records of invoice collections) and some tax returns of GMS. His opinions were generally categorized as compensation and bonus-related damages, out-of-pocket damages and lost profit. The damage period was calculated beginning August 7, 1990, based on Leslie Henkels’ testimony that on that date some of the defendants discussed their plan to leave Dowd. He noted that there was some dispute as to when the damage period was to begin (August 7 or September 25), so some calculations were computed based on both dates and listed separately. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page954" class="pagebreak">954</span>Lundy testified in detail as to the amounts he calculated and the supporting information for those amounts.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, Lundy testified that it was his opinion that the total damages incurred in this case amounted to $2,591,605.54. Lundy determined that the compensation and bonus-related monies issued to Nancy Gleason, Maureen Gleason, Douglas Shreffler and Judith Gleason totaled $440,274. The lost profits totaled $871,199.75. Lundy testified that he used a two-year period for the lost profits because of the manner in which law firms perform their accounting and because the information provided to Harris Bank by defendants for GMS’s line of credit included a two-year projection. Lundy’s calculations also included, but are not limited to, the following: Gleason and Shreffler’s salaries for the period August 7, 1990, to December 31, 1990, totaling $110,999.89; a $9,719.81 construction expense in Dowd’s sublease; $5,817.35 for the reinsurance conference held in Bermuda in November 1990 attended by, among others, Virginia Vermillion, Nancy Gleason, and Allstate’s Riley; $5,624 Allstate lawyers’ section Christmas party; total compensation, bonus-related and out-of-pocket damages in the amount of $849,206.04; and $871,199.75 in lost profit damages for years’ end December 31, 1991, and December 31, 1992.</p>
<p class="indent">The court held that the damages, as a result of defendants’ breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, totaled $2,464,889.46. This was based on the total compensation/bonus payments and out-of-pocket damages of $812,859.90 incurred between August 7, 1990, to December 31, 1992, minus salaries and bonuses paid to nonparties Judy Gleason and Maureen Gleason, plus two years of lost profits. The court did not include the costs of the trip to Bermuda or the Allstate lawyers’ section Christmas party because “there is no way to determine whether or not the GMS firm benefitted from those matters, or if Plaintiff would have had them in any event, even if it had known that Gleason was leaving.”</p>
<p class="indent">The assessment of damages by a trial court sitting without a jury will not be set aside unless it is manifestly erroneous. In the instant case, the damages award is based on the detailed testimony and exhibits provided by Dowd’s expert witness. The forfeiture of salary represented a period of time beginning with the breach of defendants’ fiduciary duty and ends with an allowance of damages for Dowd’s lost profits for a two-year period. Illinois law permits a complete forfeiture of any salary paid by a corporation to its fiduciary during a time when the fiduciary was breaching his duty to the corporation. Though there was no indication that defendants did not work at the efficiency level or with the diligence that they had prior to deciding to leave Dowd, they cannot claim a right to retain the compensation earned while breaching their fiduciary duty to Dowd.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page955" class="pagebreak">955</div>
<p class="indent">Defendants next assert that the trial court erroneously required the forfeiture of bonuses Gleason received as a part of her compensation prior to her resignation because all partners agreed sometime in August 1990 to issue bonuses and all partners received bonuses.</p>
<p class="indent">Ken Gurber, a nondeparting partner at Dowd, testified that bonuses were paid for past performance and service to the firm, based on individuals’ performance history and work that was done that year. Gurber also testified that the amounts were tied to the amount of income that the firm had during the year and were an inducement for future performance and to keep qualified individuals at the firm. He testified that the pay out of bonuses left the firm “cash poor.” Bob Yelton, another nondeparting partner, testified that bonuses were predicated upon past performance and an inducement for future performance. Even Michael Dowd, by way of deposition, testified that in 1990, year-end bonuses were distributed because they “made some money” and they “had some to distribute.” The idea that Mike Dowd would not have approved bonuses had he known that defendants were intending to leave and form their own firm has no bearing on the fact that the bonuses were approved based, at least in part, on past performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the bonuses were based in part on work performed antecedent to the period of breach (established here as beginning on August 7, 1990), they were properly included in the damages award in that the departing partners had already contemplated and discussed leaving the firm by the time the bonuses were voted upon. Nonetheless, they did not notify the firm of their intentions until after both bonuses had been issued. Because the bonuses issued here appear to be based on both past performance and as an inducement to perform well in the future, we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for defendants to have to forfeit those amounts. In our view, similar to the appropriateness of forfeiting salaries for the period of the breach of one’s fiduciary duty, the forfeiture of bonuses during that same period may be included in the damages calculation if supported by the record. Moreover, the trial court held that Dowd proved damages with a reasonable degree of certainty, and based on the evidence, we cannot say that the holding was manifestly erroneous.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants further postulate that the damages improperly reflect fees generated by work done on files that were opened at Dowd and transferred to GMS and fees on every new assignment given to Gleason at her new firm in 1991 and 1992. In defendants’s view, the trial court’s decision and award of damages “effectively negates Rules 1.5 and 5.6 of the Rules of Professional Conduct as promulgated by the Supreme Court.”</p>
<p class="indent">Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (134 Ill.2d R. 1.5(f)) states that a lawyer shall not divide a fee for legal services with another lawyer who is not in the same firm, unless the client consents to employment of the other lawyer by signing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page956" class="pagebreak">956</span>a disclosure. Rule 5.6 (134 Ill.2d R. 5.6) provides that a lawyer shall not participate in offering or making a partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement, or an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer’s right to practice is part of the settlement of a controversy between private parties.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not believe that the court’s ruling for damages violates either of these rules of professional conduct, as the court did not include fees for services rendered in 1991 and 1992 at GMS, but for <span class="italic">profits</span> that resulted from their misconduct. A “fee” is defined as a “charge for labor or services, esp. professional services” (Black’s Law Dictionary 629 (7th ed.1999)) and fee-splitting is “[t]he division of attorney’s fees between the lawyer who handles a matter and the lawyer who referred the matter” (Black’s Law Dictionary 631 (7th ed.1999)). A profit is defined as “the excess of revenues over expenditure in a business transaction.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1226 (7th ed.1999). This case involves a breach of fiduciary duty, and the law clearly states that a defendant should not be permitted to retain any profits from such a breach.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally, a plaintiff must present competent proof of lost profits from which a reasonable basis of computation can be derived. Since lost profits are determined by many factors, it must be shown with a reasonable degree of certainty that defendants breached caused a specific portion of the lost profits. Here, plaintiffs’ expert provided a report and explanation of how he arrived at the lost profits included in his damages opinion. The inclusion of lost profits represents the monies Dowd would have earned had Allstate remained with the firm. The trial court found the exhibit and accompanying testimony to be calculated to a reasonable degree of certainty and defendants do not even raise such an issue.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. <span class="italic">Fred Siegel Co. v. Arter &amp; Hadden</span>, 707 N.E.2d 853 (Ohio 1999), involved an employee who had worked with the plaintiffs until she resigned to join the defendant law firm. During the defendant’s ten-year employ with the plaintiffs, she had full “access to information regarding the identity and addresses of Siegel clients and contact persons, and fee agreements.” She also maintained a Rolodex containing information about personal and professional acquaintances. When the defendant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page957" class="pagebreak">957</span>left the plaintiff firm, she took her Rolodex with her and also had a Siegel client list. The defendant then wrote letters to Siegel clients informing them that she was now at Arter &amp; Hadden and that she “would like … to continue [her] professional relationship [with them].” The court held that “[i]n her letters to Siegel clients she not only provided information as to her change of law firms, but also expressed a willingness to continue providing legal services at the new firm. She thereby solicited Siegel clients to change legal representation.” The court employed Section 767 of the Restatement in determining whether “an actor’s interference with another’s contract is improper.” Turning to Section 768 of the Restatement, the court held that “establishment of the privilege of fair competition … will defeat a claim of tortious interference with contract where the contract is terminable at will.” However, finding that “[t]he evidence is ambiguous as to whether [defendant attorney] and [defendant law firm] used information acquired through improper means in their competitive efforts,” the court refused to defeat plaintiff’s claim for tortious interference.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. In <span class="italic">Binns v. Greenberg</span>, 480 F.Supp.2d 773 (E.D. Pa. 2007), the defendant law firm consulted with the plaintiff regarding a client the defendant represented. The plaintiff was referred to as “of counsel,” but the plaintiff never entered into a separate agreement with the client. Faced with low funds, the defendant terminated the plaintiff. Subsequently, the plaintiff attempted to convince the client to “transfer his representation to [the plaintiff] or demand that [the plaintiff] remain fully involved through [the defendant].” Once the defendant became aware of this, the defendant “remind[ed] [the plaintiff] that he was not authorized to represent [the client].” The plaintiff then initiated suit against the defendant for tortious interference. Because no express or implied contract existed between the plaintiff and the client and because there was no evidence that the defendant acted unreasonably, the court found that no jury could find that the defendant’s conduct was improper.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Cases like <span class="italic">Adler Barish</span> and <span class="italic">Dowd &amp; Dowd</span> are set in the context of a traditional model of law practice that is waning, one where there is an underlying assumption of long-term exclusive and often life-long relationships of trust among the lawyers of law firm, and between the firm and its clients. Daniel J. Bussel, <span class="italic">No Conflict</span>, 25 G<small>EORGETOWN</small> J.L.E. 207, 227-28 (2012), contrasts this older model with the brave new world of modern law practice:</p>
<p class="blockquote">The legal marketplace of 2012 is vastly different. Many law firms today employ hundreds or thousands of lawyers located in offices throughout the world, many of whom barely (if at all) know one another, engaged in all sorts of diverse practices. In 2011, the largest law firm in the American Lawyer’s AMLAW 100 was Baker &amp; McKenzie, with $2.27 billion in annual revenue and 3,800 attorneys practicing in seventy offices located in forty-two countries on every continent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page958" class="pagebreak">958</span>save Antarctica. The smallest AMLAW 100 firm was McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge, with $276.5 million in annual revenue and 425 lawyers located in nine United States offices and one in Europe. … Such firms naturally represent thousands of clients at any one time. Lawyers at all levels from senior partner to junior partner to associate change firms regularly. The anomaly today is the lawyer who, having joined a firm as an associate upon graduation from law school and become a partner in that firm, retires from that same firm forty or fifty years later. Huge international firms with diverse practices also commonly merge.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Moreover, the stability and exclusivity that characterized most lawyer-institutional client relationships in the past has been greatly eroded. In-house legal staffs have increased in size and status, and the practice in engaging outside counsel now is to “spread it around,” engaging the best lawyers for the particular matter based on a net-work of relationships with individual and often mobile partners at multiple firms.</p>
<p class="indent">How do these massive structural changes in the market for legal services and lawyers affect the analysis regarding the potential liability of departing partners who seek to transfer their existing client relationships (“book of business”) to competitors who recruit them away from their firms? Should they?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. One set of issues of major concern facing departing partners from dissolving law firms have been so-called “unfinished business,” or “<span class="italic">Jewel v. Boxer,”</span> claims against departing lawyers and the new law firms that substitute in as counsel in the dissolving firm’s ongoing client matters. Bankruptcy trustees and creditors of the dissolving firm viewed these ongoing matters as an asset of the dissolving firm and sued the successor firms for profits earned on the matters post-dissolution. Most of these unfinished business claims were settled, but in a few well-known cases the departing lawyers and their new firms refused to pay up. In an influential opinion arising out of the dissolution of Heller Ehrman LLP, Judge Charles Breyer found that at least in the case of hourly fee matters that the successor firms had no liability to the dissolving firm because the clients had an absolute right to discharge their old lawyers and hire new ones:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The Trustee argues instead that the former Heller Shareholders had a fiduciary duty to account to Heller’s estate for profits their new firms earned from work on former Heller matters. However, the fiduciary duty to account is limited to partnership property. Cal. Corp. Code § 16404(b)(1). If the profits Defendants earned are not derived from Heller partnership property, then there is no duty to account. A few basic principles demonstrate why the equities do not favor finding a property interest here.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A law firm never owns its client matters. The client always owns the matter, and the most the law firm can be said to have is an expectation of future business. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page959" class="pagebreak">959</span>At the motion hearing the Trustee was unable to articulate a basis for calculating the value of this expected future business. The Trustee suggested that the value at issue here is “good will,” which does not ordinarily appear on law firm balance sheets which are on a modified cash basis. In California, and beyond, professional law partnerships do not have a “good will” asset. “The ‘good will’ which plaintiff claims—the expectation of future business—is personal and confidential and attaches to the individual partners of the firm, thus, no monetary value can be attributed to it and there is nothing to sell.” The good will the Trustee discussed may be real in one sense: certainly a firm’s reputation is a crucial part of its ability to obtain work. However, good will is not an asset to which a property interest attaches. Moreover, Heller’s bankruptcy did much to undermine the firm’s otherwise stellar reputation and to eviscerate any reasonable expectation of future business.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Obviously, the expectation of future business—if it is “good will”—would disappear as soon as either (1) the client removes business, which it can do at will, or (2) the law firm ceases to be able to perform the work to generate those expected future profits. “It has long been recognized in [California] that the client’s power to discharge an attorney, with or without cause, is absolute.” <span class="italic">Fracasse v. Brent</span> (Cal. 1972). When a client exercises “the unilateral right to discharge his or her attorney,” the party discharged “only has a right to quantum meruit recovery” for the value of work already done on the matter. <span class="italic">Jalali v. Root</span> (Cal. App. 2003). Here, the client matters at issue ceased to be Heller’s partnership business and became the Defendants’ partnership business when the clients terminated Heller and retained new, third-party counsel.</p>

<p class="fn_txt1">In view of the state of the law relating to perpetuities and restraints on alienation and the nature of the error, if any, assertedly made by defendant in preparing the instrument, it would not be proper to hold that defendant failed to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly exercise.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-168" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_168" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a>.  Like all generalizations, this one is subject to an important exception. Uniform Commercial Code § [9-406(f)] makes ineffective a term in any contract prohibiting the assignment of a [particular] contract right: i.e., a right to payment.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-169" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_169" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>.  Throughout this opinion, in an effort to avoid both cumbersome locutions and clumsy acronyms (“IIPEA”), we use the phrase “interference with economic relations” to refer to the tort generally known as “intentional interference with prospective contractual or economic relations” and to distinguish it from the cognate form, “intentional interference with contract.”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-170" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_170" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>.  In establishing Adler Barish, its partners brought with them approximately 1300 cases from their old law firm, Freedman, Borowsky and Lorry, in which they shared approximately half the profits, losses, and assets. The two firms later signed a writing whose terms gave Adler Barish custody and control over the 1300 files transferred, and preserved the financial interest partners of Adler Barish had before leaving the Freedman firm. Clients whose files were transferred became clients of Adler Barish. From March, 1976 to April, 1977, Adler Barish opened over six hundred new case files.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">Appellees were salaried employees of the Freedman firm at the time Adler Barish was formed. Appellees left Freedman and went to work for Adler Barish.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">We take our statement of facts from the findings of fact of the court of common pleas, sitting in equity….</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-171" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_171" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  The firm received documents relating to cases for which it apparently had no file. Contrary to the firm’s procedure, Epstein personally maintained files for some cases. Likewise, Epstein did not adhere to Adler Barish policy concerning certain fees. Adler Barish obtained a case which was assigned to Epstein. He sent the file to an out of state attorney for further handling. Instead of turning over the forwarding fee to the firm, Epstein kept it for himself. It appears that these events led to termination of Epstein’s employment.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-172" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_172" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>.  Appellees’ contacts pose consequences more serious than mailing of announcements in conformity with DR 2–102 and as allowed by the decree of the court of common pleas. Appellees’ contacts make express their interest in Adler Barish clients’ cases, while announcements, at most, only suggest the same. Moreover, appellees’ form letters and self addressed envelopes, unlike announcements, provide appellees a means of benefiting from a clients’ immediate, perhaps ill considered, response to the circumstances.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-173" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_173" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>.  We also recognize that <span class="italic">In re Primus</span> forbids governmental sanctioning of an attorney who, in pursuit of ideological goals, advises a prospective client of legal rights and offers the free legal assistance of a nonprofit organization of which the attorney is a member. But appellees’ goals were vastly different. Appellees were interested not in any particular client or the specific issues the cases they sought might raise, but rather their own financial gain.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-174" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_174" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a>.  Thus, new Restatement (Second) of Torts focuses upon whether conduct is “proper,” rather than “privileged.” Compare Restatement of Torts, § 766 (1939) (“[e]xcept as stated in Section 698 [ (relating to contracts to marry) ], <span class="italic">one who without a privilege to do so</span>, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to (a) perform a contract with another, or (b) enter into or continue a business relation with another is liable to the other for the harm caused thereby”). Comment b to Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra at § 767, explains the shift in inquiry:</p>
<p class="fn_txti1"><span class="italic">Privilege to Interfere, or Interference Not Improper</span>. Unlike other intentional torts such as intentional injury to person or property, or defamation, this branch of tort law has not developed a crystallized set of definite rules as to the existence or nonexistence of a privilege to act in the manner stated in §§ 766, 766A or 766B. Because of this fact, this Section is expressed in terms of whether the interference is improper or not rather than in terms of a specific privilege to act in the manner specified. The issue in each case is whether the interference is improper or not under the circumstances; whether, upon a consideration of the relative significance of the factors involved, the conduct should be permitted without liability, despite its effect of harm to another.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-175" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/20_chapter09.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_175" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a>.  In <span class="italic">Richette</span>, an attorney representing an employee of the defendant railroad company and member of the defendant union, brought suit charging that defendants improperly interfered with a fee agreement between plaintiff and the employee. The employee, injured at work, had retained plaintiff, but later discharged him. In upholding the jury’s award of compensatory damages for plaintiff, this Court concluded:</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">The jury was warranted in finding from the evidence presented that the named defendants coordinated, through wile, stratagem and deception to separate an attorney from his client. It could not be said, as a matter of the law, that the jury went astray when they concluded, as they must have, that [the employee] did not voluntarily write a letter revoking his power of attorney to [plaintiff]. Logic, sequence of events, and palpable circumstances justify their conclusion that the railroad company representatives prepared a letter of revocation, that they employed a maneuver to have [the employee] copy that letter outside the railroad company office, thinking that this would wipe away their participation in the affair; that they supplied [the employee] with the paper on which he was to copy the letter of revocation; that [a union official], working with the railroad, supervised the copying, and supplied the envelope, in which he placed the letter, which he consigned to the United States mails. The jury were warranted in concluding that all the named defendants were a part of this plan and participated fully in the enterprise which finally resulted in depriving a member of the Philadelphia bar from legal business properly his.</p>
<p class="fn_txt">First Pennsylvania Bank’s willingness to extend appellees credit on the basis of expected fees from cases confirms the financial significance of Adler Barish’s fee agreements.</p>
