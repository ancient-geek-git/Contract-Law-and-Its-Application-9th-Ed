<p class="indent">The law in English-speaking countries has focused on enforcing promises that are part of a bargained-for exchange. A bargained-for or purchased promise is supported by “consideration” and generally will be enforced. Consideration refers to “the element of exchange required for a contract [to be] enforceable as a bargain….” Comment <span class="italic">a</span>, Restatement, Second, Contracts § 71. Said another way, consideration is what the promisor asks for and receives in return for the promise.</p>
<p class="indent">Chief Justice Robquist on p. 16 first introduced you to the notion of consideration. This interest in enforcing bargained-for exchanges reflects the economic orientation of the common law. Bargained-for exchanges usually are market transactions that seek to reallocate resources profitably for the parties and therefore efficiently for society at large. Moreover, promises that are valuable enough to pay for are important enough to merit social protection and enforcement. Finally, when a promisee relies on a promise by paying for it, a sense of justice demands that the promisor should not be allowed to keep the benefit received for the promise without performing the obligation undertaken.</p>
<p class="indent">Two points should be made as we begin our study of consideration. First, as Chief Justice Robquist, pp. 13-17 makes clear, consideration doctrine has been around for a long time and has picked up bumps and barnacles over the generations. You will encounter divergent definitions of consideration in the case law. Many of these complications grow out of expectations that an exchange will be a symmetrical transaction in which the values on each side will be roughly equal. Recall the troubles you had early in Chapter One with cases like <span class="italic">Mattei v. Hopper</span>, p. 31, <span class="italic">Sylvan Crest Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States</span>, p. 36 and <span class="italic">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff–Gordon</span>, p. 40, because one side seemed to be putting much more into the deal than the other. This expectation is natural and, as you have already seen, continues to bother us even as we recognize exchanges of grossly disparate values. We will return to this expectation and the promises it engenders in Topic III, when we study the question of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page474" class="pagebreak">474</span>adequacy of consideration. Train yourself to look at consideration as a requirement that, to be enforceable, a promise must be part of a <span class="bold"><span class="italic">bargained-for exchange</span></span>. Viewed this way the notion is simple enough and remarkably useful as a predictor of contract enforceability. Avoid conceptualizations of consideration that suggest you look for benefits and detriments, not because there are not respectable authorities of former generations, and a few of the current generation, that use such language (you will find many such statements), but because this terminology is unhelpful in predicting how courts should decide cases. If you work at it, you will always find a detriment or a benefit. Unless that detriment or benefit was bargained-for, that is, unless it was the price for the promise, it will not be consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, do not fall into the trap of viewing consideration as the exclusive mark of an enforceable promise. As Justice Kenthom pointed out in <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span>, p. 17, everyone recognizes that bargained-for promises have a heavy claim to enforcement, but traditional doctrine fails to tell us why <span class="italic">only</span> bargained-for promises should be enforceable. Consideration has followed a path similar to other legal ideas as it has moved from being a factor that marked the enforceable promise to becoming the exclusive defining feature of an enforceable promise, to the role it plays today as the principal, but not exclusive, mark of contract enforceability. Later in this Chapter we will explore some of the competitors and supplements to consideration that Justice Kagamayor introduced you to on p. 19. Soon enough you will see the limits of the bargain notion. In the meantime, you should begin to develop the lawyer’s suspicion (keep it a suspicion, not a certainty!) that when a promise is not bargained for, it may not be deemed serious or important enough in the law’s eyes to be enforceable.</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">An unbargained-for promise, unless enforceable for some special reason, will be labeled a “gift promise” and will not be enforced. The term gift promise implies the conclusion of non-enforceability. It does not imply that the “gift” was motivated by love or benevolence. A promise that is not part of a bargain is presumptively not legally enforced, but that does not mean it is not a promise to be kept: family and personal relationships, business reputation, trust, moral probity, and self-esteem may dictate performance of a legally unenforceable gift promise.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember that we are talking about promises, not performances. The law’s insistence that gift promises are not enforceable does not mean that a donor can reclaim a gift after making it. The crucial moment is delivery. An unperformed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page475" class="pagebreak">475</span>promise to make a gift of $100 can be withdrawn and will not be enforced, but once the $100 is delivered, it cannot be recalled.</p>
<p class="indent">The law leaves room in the definition of “delivery” for cases such as delivery of the key to a safety deposit box as delivery of the contents, or delivery of a document of title such as a deed or a car’s “pink slip” or a bill of lading as delivery of the physical property (constructive or symbolic delivery). But prior to some physical delivery related to a promised gift, the promise can be withdrawn or repudiated.</p>

<p id="sec214" class="noindent">3 S<small>AMUEL</small> W<small>ILLISTON</small>, W<small>ILLISTON ON</small> C<small>ONTRACTS</small> § 7:18 (R<small>ICHARD</small> A. L<small>ORD ED</small>.) (4<small>TH ED</small>. 2003):</p>
<p class="indent">If a benevolent man says to a tramp, “If you go around the corner to the clothing shop there, you may purchase an overcoat on my credit,” no reasonable person would understand that the short walk was requested as the consideration for the promise; rather, the understanding would be that in the event of the tramp going to the shop the promisor would make him a gift. Yet the walk to the shop is in its nature capable of being consideration. It is a legal detriment to the tramp to take the walk, and the only reason why the walk is not consideration is because on a reasonable interpretation, it must be held that the walk was not requested as the price of the promise, but was merely a condition of a gratuitous promise.</p>
<p class="indent">It is often a difficult question to decide whether words of condition in a promise indicate a request for consideration or state a mere condition in a gratuitous promise. … In close cases, whether the promisee has incurred a detriment on the faith of the promise or has conferred a benefit on the promisor in bringing about the condition, may control the outcome, for courts in such a case will naturally be loath to regard the promise as a mere gratuity and the detriment incurred or benefit conferred as merely a condition. It is therefore not surprising that courts, prodded by the drafters of the Restatement and the Restatement (Second), have offered increasing protection to promisees who incur detriment or confer a benefit on the faith of a promise. This helps to explain those cases where courts have enforced options to purchase land for which no consideration is given other than the promise to make an expensive examination of the property or title, when the promisee has incurred the expense or made valuable improvements. This same rationale underlies those decisions upholding promises to make provision by will in recognition of services to the promisor when the claimant, having fully performed, sues the estate. Some courts have also gone to great lengths to find an element of bargain in family settlements, a result focusing not only on the detriment undergone or benefit conferred but also encouraged by the strong public policy favoring family settlements. But in some cases, it is so clear that a conditional gift was intended that, despite the fact <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page476" class="pagebreak">476</span>that the promisee has incurred detriment or the promisor obtained some minor benefit, the promise has been held unenforceable.</p>
<p id="sec215" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What makes Williston so certain that “on a reasonable construction it must be held that the [tramp’s] walk was not requested as the price of the promise, but was merely a condition of a gratuitous promise”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Is it so clear that the walk was of no benefit to the benevolent man or of no detriment to the tramp? If the benevolent man were to ask the tramp to mail a letter on the way to the clothing store, would mailing it be “consideration” or an additional “condition”? Should we even speak of “benefit” and “detriment” when Restatement, Second, Contracts § 71(2) (p. 16) provides that a “performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The law recognizes that gifts can serve a social purpose, <span class="italic">and</span> it affirms the validity of executed gifts. Is it not inconsistent to deny enforcement of promises to make gifts?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Are “free gift” offers based on conditions, such as buying 10 gallons of gas, opening a savings account, or visiting a new subdivision, ever intended to be generous acts? If not, are they gift promises at all? But are they requests to bargain?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Recall <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span>, p. 13. Didn’t Best promise to send its trucks to Southland’s warehouse to pick up the plywood and to return and have its employees re-pile the wood when its shipment came in? Are these requested acts conditions on a gift promise by Southland or part of a bargained for exchange? Aren’t they detrimental reliance, a burden to Best?</p>

<p id="sec216" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON THE EXCHANGE OF PROMISES</span></p>
<p class="indent">The idea of bargain reflected in the doctrine of consideration is relatively easy to understand when it refers to the present exchange of tangible objects or performances. It is easy to see that one party may give up a cow in immediate exchange for another’s horse or that one party may undertake immediate performance as the price of the performance undertaken by the other. But when the bargain consists of the present exchange of promises to render future performances, the English common law’s acceptance was not so readily forthcoming. It took centuries before the agreement consisting of a promise for a promise was generally seen as an exchange <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page477" class="pagebreak">477</span>of things real enough to enforce—a conceptual difficulty paralleled, anthropologists tell us, in the development of a variety of cultures.</p>
<p class="indent">As feudalism receded, treating promises as things of value was inevitable because the most significant bargains in commercial societies involve exchanges over time. Do not lose sight of the fact that the person who bargains for and receives a promise is typically interested not in the promise as such, but in the expectation of receiving the performance that lies behind the words. Checks and securities are printed on very pretty paper, but few of us would assign to them the value we do if we were not confident of the performance they promise. Thus, a promise is consideration if the performance promised would be consideration if it alone were bargained for.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, for reasons that are not altogether clear or inevitable, promises may be consideration for a return promise if they are capable of being relied upon, without regard to whether they were in fact relied upon. Thus, if Jack promises Jill to sell her a car, delivery in 30 days, in exchange for Jill’s promise to pay $5,000 at the time of delivery, a contract is formed at the moment the promises are exchanged, and neither party thereafter may withdraw. The respective promises justify reliance and the law treats them as things of value given in exchange in order to make the other party’s promise enforceable. If a day, or even a minute, later Jack repudiates and is sued for breach of the agreement, he cannot defend on the basis that Jill did not significantly change her position by performing or otherwise relying upon the promise. In other words, the fact that the contract is wholly executory—the parties have neither begun performance, nor in any other way relied upon the promises—does not mean the promises exchanged are not supported by consideration and thus unenforceable. What inchoate justifications are there for the enforcement of unrelied upon mutual promises?</p>

<p id="sec217" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">General Motors Corp. v. Michigan Dep’t of Treasury</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Supreme Court of Michigan, 2002. 466 Mich. 231,644 N.W.2d 734.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ W<small>EAVER</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff, General Motors Corporation (GM), appeals from the Court of Appeals decision that defendant, Department of Treasury, could impose use tax on the vehicle components and parts plaintiff provided to customers as part of plaintiff’s goodwill adjustments policy. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and hold that assessment of use tax on the goodwill adjustments was improper because they were taxed pursuant to the General Sales Tax Act when customers purchased vehicles at retail.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page478" class="pagebreak">478</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">When customers purchase new GM automobiles, they are provided with a GM limited manufacturer’s warranty. These limited manufacturer’s warranties provide, in pertinent part, for the replacement of defective parts of the automobile under certain circumstances. They also generally provide coverage for an expressly stated length of time, subject to earlier expiration, if the vehicle is driven for a certain number of miles. The department acknowledges that parts provided under these limited warranties are not subject to use tax because the customers paid for the right to replacement parts under the warranties at the time of the retail sale.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the limited warranties, GM provides a more open-ended “goodwill” adjustment policy under which GM will, on a discretionary basis, pay for replacement parts for GM vehicles even after the limited warranty period has expired. Although not referred to by name as a “goodwill adjustment policy,” notice of this policy is contained in the General Motors warranty manual provided to customers at the time of sale. In this regard, the manual provides:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">Should you ever encounter a problem during <span class="italic">or after</span> the warranty periods that is not resolved, talk to a member of dealer management. If the problem persists, follow the additional procedure outlined in “Owner Assistance,” on page 16 of this booklet. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent">The Owner Assistance section of the manual outlines a “Customer Satisfaction Procedure.” It states that problems will “normally” be resolved by the dealer’s sales or service departments.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_93" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-93" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> However, if a concern is not resolved at that level, the manual recommends first discussing the problem with the dealership management. If the problem is not resolved by the dealer management, customers are told to contact GM directly. A customer dissatisfied with the outcome of the procedure may elect arbitration. The manual states that, while a customer is not bound to accept the result of the arbitration proceeding, GM will “generally” agree to be bound by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page479" class="pagebreak">479</span>it even though it reserves the right to terminate its participation in the arbitration program.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_94" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-94" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The department conducted an audit of GM’s compliance with Michigan tax laws for the period of January 1, 1986, through December 31, 1992. As a result of the audit, the department assessed against GM use taxes and interest of $5.5 million on the vehicle components and parts provided by GM to customers as goodwill adjustments. The department had not previously assessed such a tax. During the audit period, GM customers in Michigan obtained $82 million in components and parts under the goodwill policy.</p>
<p class="indent">GM appealed the assessment to the Court of Claims. In pertinent part, GM alleged that the department lacked the statutory authority to impose use tax on goodwill adjustments because sales tax was imposed on the cost of the goodwill adjustments when vehicles were sold at retail. However, the Court of Claims disagreed with GM’s position and granted summary disposition in favor of the department pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), holding, in relevant part, that the transfer of parts under the goodwill program is subject to use tax. The Court of Appeals affirmed regarding this issue, concluding that “plaintiff’s dealers were not obligated to provide all customers with goodwill adjustments” and, therefore, that the “value of the goodwill program was not included in the gross proceeds arising from the retail sales of plaintiff’s vehicles.” The Court of Appeals also emphasized its view that the purchasers of GM vehicles did not obtain “any enforceable rights in the goodwill program.” We granted leave to appeal.<br />…</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III</span></p>
<p class="noindent">…</p>
<p class="indent">GM contends that the cost of its goodwill adjustments is exempt from use tax under § 4(1)(a) of the UTA. M.C.L. § 205.94(1)(a) provides that “[p]roperty sold in this state on which transaction a tax is paid under the general sales tax act” is exempt from the use tax “if the tax was due and paid on the retail sale to a consumer.” Thus, our inquiry is whether “tax was due and paid” pursuant to the GTA on the cost of the goodwill adjustments when vehicles were sold at retail.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of retail sale, GM customers receive an owner’s manual. The manual invites customers to initiate a dialogue with the dealership when a defect arises, “during or after the warranty periods.” The manual states the goal of resolving the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page480" class="pagebreak">480</span>defect to the “customer’s satisfaction.” GM admits that its customers are not guaranteed that requested after-warranty goodwill adjustments will be made. Indeed, GM suggests its dealers negotiate with customers for copayment on goodwill adjustments case by case. Nevertheless, GM’s goodwill policy is a promise to hear and address customer complaints even after the written warranty expires.</p>
<p class="indent">To have consideration there must be a bargained-for exchange. There must be “‘a benefit on one side, or a detriment suffered, or service done on the other.’” <span class="italic">Plastray Corp. v. Cole,</span> 324 Mich. 433, 440 (1949). Courts do not generally inquire into the sufficiency of consideration. It has been said “[a] cent or a pepper corn, in legal estimation, would constitute a valuable consideration.” <span class="italic">Whitney v. Stearns,</span> 16 Me. 394 (1839). The owner’s manual provided at the time of sale invites customers to voice complaints even after the warranty period ends, with the goal of resolving the complaint to the customer’s satisfaction. We hold that this opportunity for dialogue and possible resolution of complaints—even outside the warranty period—is a benefit flowing to purchasers of GM vehicles at the time of retail sale and, therefore, is consideration for the sale.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_95" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-95" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup> Therefore, replacement parts provided pursuant to the goodwill program are subject to the sales tax at the time of retail sale and are exempt from the use tax under § 4(1)(a) of the UTA.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_96" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">GM’s promise pursuant to its goodwill adjustments policy, while discretionary with respect to whether there will be any “adjustment,” is not discretionary regarding GM’s obligation to act reasonably and in good faith in response to a customer complaint.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_97" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-97" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span></sup> Reinforcing this contractual undertaking to act in good faith is … Michigan’s version of the Uniform Commercial Code. M.C.L. § 440.1203 provides that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page481" class="pagebreak">481</span>“[e]very contract or duty within this act imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_98" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-98" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></sup> This means that, should GM not consider complaints under the goodwill adjustment policy in good faith, it can be sued.</p>
<p class="indent">The dissent agrees that a unilateral or discretionary promise could “constitute valid consideration.” However, the dissent would decline to rule that GM’s promise is valid consideration in part because GM’s customers have “little if any” knowledge of the scope of GM’s discretion. That it is unknown how liberally GM will exercise its discretion does not mean there is no discretion. In fact, it means there is discretion, i.e., a benefit to the consumer.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_99" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-99" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></sup> The dissent has fallen into the error of considering not merely if there is consideration, but its sufficiency. As we have stated, courts do not inquire into the adequacy of consideration to support a contract.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_100" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-100" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span></sup> Thus, we conclude that the duty the goodwill policy imposes on GM to consider requests for redress in good faith is a valuable consideration that is worth far more than the legendary peppercorn.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_101" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-101" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, the evidence indicates that for the period 1986-1992, plaintiff provided “goodwill” parts to customers of General Motors cars having an estimated value of $82 million. As the dissent itself recognizes, “the cost of … [these] parts has been factored into the retail cost of the car….” If this is so, then such costs have been necessarily paid by the consumer at sale, i.e., a car otherwise valued at $9975 has been increased in price to $10,000 and the consumer has paid an additional $25 for the goodwill policy. Plaintiff, not being a charitable institution, must necessarily <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page482" class="pagebreak">482</span>have factored the cost of the goodwill policy into the cost of the car, and such cost must necessarily have been paid by the consumer. Further, it can be presumed that the consumer paid $25 because something of value passed. The automobile industry is sufficiently competitive that few companies can afford to tack costs onto their products for parts or services that are perceived as valueless by their consumers. Contrary to the dissent, we can easily envision a “rational, self-interested market participant” paying something for a benefit estimated to provide more than $13 million in annual benefits to consumers. Our interpretation of M.C.L. § 205.94(1)(a) does not constitute a “lax” interpretation of consideration as the dissent asserts. Rather, our interpretation is based on fundamental contract principles and reflects the realities of the marketplace.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_102" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-102" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">Because the goodwill adjustment policy provides an opportunity for GM customers to seek redress of vehicle defects and because the policy is included in the retail price of GM vehicles and purchased at the time of retail sale, it is part of the consideration flowing to GM customers when they purchase a GM vehicle that is taxed pursuant to the GTA at retail sale. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Court of Claims for entry of judgment in favor of GM.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>AVANAGH</small>, J. (dissenting).</p>
<p class="indent">I write separately to express my disagreement with the majority’s conclusion that retail new car customers exchange consideration for goodwill policy parts when purchasing vehicles manufactured by plaintiff. Plaintiff has claimed its goodwill repair parts should not be subject to use tax because the costs are included in the price of the vehicle, which is subject to sales tax. Under M.C.L. § 205.94(1)(a), no use tax is owed on retail sales subject to sales tax. However, this exemption applies only if the parts are included in a “sale at retail,” i.e., “a transaction by which the ownership of tangible personal property is transferred for consideration….” M.C.L. § 205.51(1)(b). Because I cannot agree that the goodwill parts are transferred for consideration, I must respectfully dissent.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page483" class="pagebreak">483</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff directs its dealers to make goodwill adjustments case by case “where special consideration is in order to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.” Most dealers have the discretion to provide repair parts free or at a reduced rate to consumers after the original warranty expires. These repairs are provided to select customers who are unsatisfied with defective parts after the manufacturer’s warranty expires.</p>
<p class="indent">Consumers are not given any general or specific information concerning the goodwill program and are informed in the warranty manual of their right to contact plaintiff after the manufacturer’s warranty expires if they are dissatisfied with the dealer’s offered resolution. The written warranty also indicates that arbitration proceedings may be an option.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_103" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-103" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> In essence, the consumer is given an opportunity to ask for free repair parts, but has no legal right to any specific repair and knows nothing of the goodwill policy program in general, or of its specific terms. Though plaintiff may agree to subject itself to arbitration proceedings, consumers gain no legally enforceable right as a result of this program, a program purportedly “purchased” at the retail sale.</p>
<p class="indent">Consideration requires bargained-for legal detriment. I agree with the majority that a discretionary promise must be exercised in good faith and that the reasonable execution of such a promise may constitute valid consideration. <span class="italic">J.R. Watkins Co. v. Rich,</span> 254 Mich. 82, 84-85 (1931); <span class="italic">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon,</span> 222 N.Y. 88 (1917). However, I am not convinced that plaintiff’s good-faith exercise of its discretionary power is sufficient to permit a finding of bargained-for consideration in this instance. A party relying on the good-faith exercise of another’s unilateral discretion generally has some knowledge of the scope of discretion involved and the potential benefits that might accrue. In this case, customers have little if any knowledge of what they allegedly bargained and paid for at the retail sale. I cannot fathom what rational, self-interested market participant would actually bargain for and purchase such a promise. If it came free with the purchase price, most would accept it, but almost no one would <span class="italic">buy</span> it.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, I am not sure that an arbitrator would have <span class="italic">any</span> reason to rule in favor of a customer if dissatisfaction actually resulted in an arbitration hearing. On the basis of the contract between the parties, the express warranty would have expired <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page484" class="pagebreak">484</span>if a customer requested parts under the goodwill policy. The simple failure to purchase a supplemental warranty suggests plaintiff has absolutely no legal or goodfaith <span class="italic">duty</span> to repair defective parts after the warranty expires. The presence of express promises (original warranty) and the opportunity to purchase supplemental promises (extended warranty) evidence the parties’ intention that plaintiff escape liability for defects after the original warranty period expires. Because information concerning the terms of the goodwill policy is generally kept secret, I am not sure that a consumer could adequately plead his case to the arbitrator, assuming plaintiff agreed to participate. All a consumer is left with is the right to complain to plaintiff, and I believe it is a stretch to consider that sufficient consideration where such a right exists regardless of the goodwill policy. Therefore, I would hold that the goodwill policy adjustment program does not constitute valid consideration.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_104" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-104" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Even so, I agree that the cost of the goodwill policy parts has been factored into the retail cost of the car, and to that extent the goodwill parts are subject both to use and sales tax. Unfortunately, because the use tax statute exempts only costs transferred for consideration in a retail sale, the Legislature essentially failed to avoid pyramiding taxes where costs are factored into a product, but are not actually part of the consideration paid.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_105" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-105" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page485" class="pagebreak">485</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">I suspect the most appropriate and forthright method to analyze the goodwill program for tax purposes would be to conceive of the parts as promotional or gratuitous items. Plaintiff grants adjustments “in order to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.” In essence, the goodwill policy is a select form of advertising, i.e., a large scale version of the distribution of free pens and cups to conference participants or the provision of free pharmaceutical samples to physicians. Dealers probably grant the benefits of the discretionary goodwill program to those customers most likely to experience enhanced manufacturer loyalty. Because the program most resembles a marketing or customer satisfaction offer, and because there is no general statutory exemption for promotional items from use tax in Michigan,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_106" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-106" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></sup> I would permit defendant to assess use taxes, assuming it does so in a uniform fashion.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">The majority permits a lax interpretation of consideration in order to bridge the gap between the text of the statute and the general desire to avoid duplicate taxation. While the end might be worthwhile, the method arguably creates an empty definition of consideration that could affect future bargainers. Rather than compensate for the legislative failure to exempt all product costs from use tax by watering down our understanding of consideration, I would hold that the repair parts are not included in the retail sale for which consideration is paid.</p>
<p id="sec218" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Is the problem in this case that GM’s “promise” to consider requests for outof-warranty service is a gift promise, or that it is illusory? Even if the promise lacked <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page486" class="pagebreak">486</span>meaningful commitment, is the subsequent performance of that promise by providing parts and service not covered by the express warranty best viewed as a gift, or as a part of GM’s original bargain with the car buyer? Or is the provision of this service just a promotional expense intended to maintain GM’s goodwill with the general public? In what sense is GM acting the part of the benevolent man in Professor Williston’s story of the tramp?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If GM never informs the buyer or the public of its goodwill policy and the buyer does not otherwise know of it, how can the undisclosed “promise” to furnish goodwill parts be part of the original bargain?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. If a buyer complains to his seller about the quality of goods delivered and the seller agrees to fix the problem without admitting contractual liability either for delivery of nonconforming goods or under a warranty, has the seller made a gift? Or is it simply an example of parties to a contract working out a dispute between themselves over their respective rights and obligations?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Why should the obligation to remit additional Michigan use tax on account of the provision of out-of-warranty parts and service depend upon whether there is a sentence on p. 16 in the Owner’s Manual advising the buyer that if she can’t work out an issue with the dealer she can contact someone at GM and if they can’t resolve the matter, GM will generally agree to arbitrate the issue? Would the parts suddenly become taxable if the Owner’s Manual said nothing more than “If you have a complaint, contact Customer Service at 1-800-GMOTORS”?</p>

<p id="sec219" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">E.J. Baehr v. Penn–O–Tex Oil Corp.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Minnesota Supreme Court, 1960.</p>
<p class="sectionb">258 Minn. 533, 104 N.W.2d 661.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ L<small>OEVINGER</small>, J. This is an action for rents which defendant is claimed to owe plaintiff because of possession and contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff leased certain gasoline filling stations to one Kemp, doing business as Webb Oil Company, under written leases. Kemp was purchasing the business known as Webb Oil Company and certain related property from defendant. On account of these transactions and purchases of petroleum products, Kemp was heavily indebted to defendant. Kemp became unable to meet payments due to defendant and on December 10, 1955, gave defendant an assignment of accounts receivable and to become receivable, including those involving the plaintiff’s filling stations. Thereafter, during the period involved here, defendant collected rents paid by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page487" class="pagebreak">487</span>operators of the filling stations, received other payments made to Webb Oil Company, paid some of its debts at Kemp’s direction out of these sums, and installed its agent in the office to run the business.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff was in Florida when he received a letter dated December 28, 1955, from Kemp, stating that defendant had all of Kemp’s assets tied up. A short time after this, plaintiff called defendant’s agent to ask about payment of the filling station rents. Plaintiff was told “that Mr. Kemp’s affairs were in a very mixed up form but that he would get them straightened out and mail me [plaintiff] my checks for the rent.” Hearing nothing further, plaintiff wrote a letter to defendant asking what he had to do to get his rent checks and adding: “Or will I have to give it to an attorney to sue.” Defendant replied by letter stating it was attempting to assist Kemp in keeping the business going, “but in no way are operating or taken possession.” The letter denied knowledge of or responsibility for any rent due plaintiff. A week or 10 days after receiving this letter, plaintiff again called defendant and asked for his rent. Defendant’s agent then said to plaintiff, “they [the company] were interested and that they would see that I [plaintiff] got my rent, and would take care of it, and they would work it out with the head office. * * * He said he would take it up with them and they would assure me my rent.”</p>
<p class="indent">The rent was not paid, and in April or May 1956 plaintiff returned to Minneapolis from Florida. Soon after this plaintiff consulted a lawyer, and “shortly thereafter, as rapidly as the lawyer could get moving, a suit was started.” On June 2, 1956, plaintiff sent defendant a letter advising that he was reentering and taking possession under the leases of the filling stations and because of failure to receive rent. On July 10, 1956, this suit was started for rents due on the filling stations for the period December 1, 1955, through June 2, 1956, upon the grounds that defendant was in possession of the stations and had contracted to pay the rent during this period.</p>
<p class="indent">The case was fully tried on all issues in the district court. At the conclusion of plaintiff’s evidence, the court ruled that the evidence was conclusive that defendant neither took possession of the filling stations nor an assignment of Kemp’s leases. Defendant then presented evidence on the issue of a contract to pay the rents, and this issue was submitted to the jury under proper instructions. The amount that would be due under such a contract was agreed upon; and the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in that amount. Thereafter, the district court granted defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; and ordered a new trial in the event of reversal. Plaintiff appealed.</p>
<p class="indent">[The Court’s rejection of plaintiff’s first theory, that defendant was liable for the rents because of its possession of the land, is omitted.]</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page488" class="pagebreak">488</div>
<p class="indent">The issue whether there was a contract by defendant to pay plaintiff is more doubtful. Unfortunately, contract, like most of the basic terms constituting the intellectual tools of law, is conventionally defined in a circular fashion. By the most common definition, a contract is a promise or set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy or the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty. This amounts to saying that a contract is a legally enforceable promise. But a promise is legally enforceable only if it is a contract. Thus nothing less than the whole body of applicable precedents suffices to define the term “contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">Although the definition of contract does not help much in determining what expressions shall be held to impose legal obligations, it does direct attention to a promise as the starting point of inquiry. Both in popular and legal usage, a promise is an assurance, in whatever form of expression given, that a thing will or will not be done. While we must take care to distinguish between statements meant to express merely present intention and those meant to give an assurance as to a future event, this involves no more than the common difficulty of seeking precise meaning in the usually imprecise, and often careless, expressions of ordinary colloquy.</p>
<p class="indent">If we accept plaintiff’s version of the statements made by defendant’s agent, as we are required to do by the verdict, there was an unequivocal assurance given that the rents would be paid. This cannot be anything but a promise.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the fact that a promise was given does not necessarily mean that a contract was made. It is clear that not every promise is legally enforceable. Much of the vast body of law in the field of contracts is concerned with determining which promises should be legally enforced. On the one hand, in a civilized community men must be able to assume that those with whom they deal will carry out their undertakings according to reasonable expectations. On the other hand, it is neither practical nor reasonable to expect full performance of every assurance given, whether it be thoughtless, casual and gratuitous, or deliberately and seriously made.</p>
<p class="indent">The test that has been developed by the common law for determining the enforceability of promises is the doctrine of consideration. This is a crude and not altogether successful attempt to generalize the conditions under which promises will be legally enforced. Consideration requires that a contractual promise be the product of a bargain. However, in this usage, “bargain” does not mean an exchange of things of equivalent, or any, value. It means a negotiation resulting in the voluntary assumption of an obligation by one party upon condition of an act or forbearance by the other. Consideration thus insures that the promise enforced as a contract is not accidental, casual, or gratuitous, but has been uttered intentionally as the result of some deliberation, manifested by reciprocal bargaining or negotiation. In this view, the requirement of consideration is no mere technicality, historical anachronism, or arbitrary formality. It is an attempt to be as reasonable as we can in deciding which promises constitute contracts. Although the doctrine has been criticized, no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page489" class="pagebreak">489</span>satisfactory substitute has been suggested. It is noteworthy that the civil law has a corresponding doctrine of “causa” which, to the eye of a common-law lawyer, is not much different than consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">Consideration, as essential evidence of the parties’ intent to create a legal obligation, must be something adopted and regarded by the parties as such. Thus, the same thing may be consideration or not, as it is dealt with by the parties. In substance, a contractual promise must be of the logical form: “If * * * (consideration is given) * * * then I promise that * * *.” Of course, the substance may be expressed in any form of words, but essentially this is the logical structure of those promises enforced by the law as contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">Applying these principles to the present case, it appears that although defendant’s agent made a promise to plaintiff, it was not in such circumstances that a contract was created. Plaintiff correctly states that an agreement of forbearance to sue may be sufficient consideration for a contract. Plaintiff further contends that his failure to institute suit immediately upon learning of Kemp’s assignment to defendant permits an inference of an agreement to forbear from suit in consideration for defendant’s assurance of payment of rents to plaintiff. This court has held that circumstantial evidence may support the inference of such an agreement to forbear. However, such an inference must rest upon something more than the mere failure to institute immediate suit. The difficulty with plaintiff’s case is that there is no more than this.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff’s conversation with defendant’s agent was about the middle of February 1956 while plaintiff was in Florida. Plaintiff returned to Minneapolis, which was his residence as well as the jurisdiction where defendant was found, about the latter part of April or the first of May 1956. Soon after this he consulted a lawyer, and suit was started “as rapidly as the lawyer could get moving.” There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that plaintiff deferred initiating legal action any longer than suited his own personal convenience. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that defendant sought any forbearance by plaintiff or thought that it was securing such action; nor is there any evidence that plaintiff’s delay from the middle of February until April or May in undertaking legal action was related to defendant’s promises. There is no evidence that either of the parties took defendant’s assurances seriously or acted upon them in any way. There was, therefore, no consideration, and the promises did not amount to a contract. Since the district court was correct in ordering judgment entered for the defendant, notwithstanding the verdict, on this ground, it is unnecessary to consider other points relating to enforceability of the alleged contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. In an omitted portion of the opinion, the Court finds that Penn–O–Tex was neither in possession of nor operating Kemp’s gas stations. Thus Baehr’s claim for rent could be maintained only against Kemp under his lease, unless Penn–O–Tex had made an enforceable promise to Baehr that it would pay the rent. Didn’t the Court find that Penn–O–Tex Oil, through its agent (who presumably had authority to act for it), promised during the telephone conversation with Mr. Baehr that the rent would be paid?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. What was the agent’s motive in assuring Baehr that the rent would be paid? What did Penn–O–Tex stand to gain if Baehr didn’t bring suit to evict Kemp, the tenant, for nonpayment of the rent?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Statements that appear promissory may nevertheless lack sufficient substance to serve as the essential element of the bargain. So, “I promise you a million dollars if you promise to accept a million dollars” is not a bargain because the return commitment is a mirror that is customarily presumed to have no significance independent of the initial promise. Otherwise, any <span class="italic">nudum pactum</span> could be linguistically transformed into a bargain. Was the return commitment by Baehr roughly the equivalent of “I promise to accept the rent payments”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. If Penn–O–Tex’s agent had explicitly asked Baehr to withhold legal action against Kemp for at least three months, promising to pay the rent if Kemp did not, and Baehr promised to so forebear, would the court have enforced Penn–O–Tex’s promise to pay the rent? Why doesn’t the court interpret the facts this way? Is it because at some fundamental level the court did not really believe that Penn–O–Tex had promised to pay the rent? Were there any express promissory words here?</p>

<h3 id="sec221" class="section"><span class="bold">III.    A<small>DEQUACY OF</small> C<small>ONSIDERATION</small></span></h3>
<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">There is common sense appeal to the idea that an important promise, and therefore a promise worthy of legal enforcement, is one for which someone paid something of significant value. But what kinds of prices are sufficient to be consideration? How do you determine whether a promise or performance is truly bargained for? Moreover, how do you decide whether one set of promises or performances was given in exchange for the other? The parties’ statement of the bargain is an obvious starting point, but placing too much weight on a recital of exchange, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page491" class="pagebreak">491</span>reduces consideration to a formality. The gift promise becomes binding because of the promisee’s reciprocal kiss; a valuable promise is exchanged for a penny.</p>
<p class="indent">Bear in mind that the law for many centuries has claimed that it cannot and should not weigh the relative values of the promise and the consideration given for it in determining the enforceability of the agreement. If serious and sensible people operating at arm’s length considered it a desirable exchange, the law says it will look no further. Classically, this principle is stated: The law will not question the adequacy of consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">As Thomas Hobbes expressed this idea centuries ago: “The value of all things contracted for, is measured by the appetite of the contractors: and therefore the just value is that which they be contented to give.” L<small>EVIATHAN</small> (1688).</p>
<p class="indent">Or as § 79 of the Restatement, Second, Contracts, puts it:</p>
<p class="list_p">If the requirement of consideration is met [that something is bargained for, <span class="italic">see</span> § 71, <span class="italic">supra</span>], there is no additional requirement of</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(a) a gain, advantage or benefit to the promisor or a loss, disadvantage, or detriment to the promisee; or</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(b) equivalence in the values exchanged; or</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(c) “mutuality of obligation.”</p>
<p class="indent">Few exchanges are precisely equal, and value usually is left to the judgment of the bargainer. But in extreme situations the value of the consideration may become so slight that we begin to wonder whether anything was paid for the promise. Moreover, value cannot always be measured in simple monetary terms. If I think a crumby old painting, or a kooky new painting, is worth $250,000, that’s my problem. Even in commercial situations, the rewards of a bargain may be subtle and not measured precisely in dollars. It may be good business or enhance one’s prestige to make what looks like a terrible bargain that draws customers into your store, or helps you to sell something else, or keeps your idle productive capacity going or makes you look and feel like a prince. What was the value of Best’s promise of reciprocity to Southland?</p>
<p class="indent">But we all become uncomfortable when the disparity between what is sold and what is paid becomes very great. Part of our discomfort arises from the sense that an unequal deal doesn’t seem serious and sensible. Somebody is either out of his mind, or didn’t understand what he was doing, or didn’t voluntarily consent to this exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the law generally presumes knowing and capable parties may determine the values involved in their serious and sensible transactions for themselves. Hence, if nothing else in the circumstances surrounding a deal looks out of line (no duress, no lack of capacity, no joke, no fraud, no mistake, etc.), the fact that the consideration appears relatively slight will not <span class="bold"><span class="italic">in itself</span></span> invalidate the deal. Significant disparity in values may cause the court to take a closer look; that itself is an important effect. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page492" class="pagebreak">492</span>But sometimes—in the course of the look—the disparity in price that was the look’s stimulant somehow gets converted into the principal evidence supporting a conclusion that there was enough wrong with the deal to invalidate it.</p>

<p id="sec222" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Apfel v. Prudential–Bache Securities</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1993.</p>
<p class="sectionb">81 N.Y.2d 470, 616 N.E.2d 1095, 600 N.Y.S.2d 433.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>IMONS</small>, J. Defendant, an investment bank, seeks to avoid an agreement to purchase plaintiffs’ idea for issuing and selling municipal bonds. Its principal contention is that plaintiffs had no property right in the idea because it was not novel and, therefore, consideration for the contract was lacking. For reasons which follow, we conclude that a showing of novelty is not required to validate the contract. The decisive question is whether the idea had value, not whether it was novel.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">In 1982, plaintiffs, an investment banker and a lawyer, approached defendant’s predecessor with a proposal for issuing municipal securities through a system that eliminated paper certificates and allowed bonds to be sold, traded, and held exclusively by means of computerized “book entries.” Initially, the parties signed a confidentiality agreement that allowed defendant to review the techniques as detailed in a 99–page summary. Nearly a month of negotiations followed before the parties entered into a sale agreement under which plaintiffs conveyed their rights to the techniques and certain trade names and defendant agreed to pay a stipulated rate based on its use of the techniques for a term from October 1982 to January 1988. Under the provisions of the contract, defendant’s obligation to pay was to remain even if the techniques became public knowledge or standard practice in the industry and applications for patents and trademarks were denied. Plaintiffs asserted that they had not previously disclosed the techniques to anyone and they agreed to maintain them in confidence until they became public.</p>
<p class="indent">From 1982 until 1985, defendant implemented the contract, although the parties dispute whether amounts due were fully paid. Defendant actively encouraged bond issuers to use the computerized “book entry” system and, for at least the first year, was the sole underwriter in the industry employing such a system. However, in 1985, following a change in personnel, defendant refused to make any further payments. It maintained that the ideas conveyed by plaintiffs had been in the public domain at the time of the sale agreement and that what plaintiffs sold had never been theirs to sell. Defendant’s attempts to patent the techniques proved unsuccessful. By 1985, investment banks were increasingly using computerized systems, and by 1990 such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page493" class="pagebreak">493</span>systems were handling 60% of the dollar volume of all new issues of municipal securities.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs commenced this litigation seeking $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p class="indent">Supreme Court concluded that triable issues existed on the questions of whether defendant breached the contract by refusing to make payments and whether plaintiffs committed a breach by allegedly disclosing the techniques to another company. The court also found defendant had raised a triable issue on whether plaintiffs had partially waived their right to payment by forgoing certain claims to compensation. The remainder of the pleadings were found to be legally insufficient. Accordingly, the court dismissed all the causes of action except the first, which alleges breach of contract, and struck all defendant’s defenses and counterclaims except those relating to breach of contract and the partial defense of waiver. The Appellate Division modified the order by reinstating defendant’s claim that the sale agreement lacked consideration. It held that novelty was required before an idea could be valid consideration but concluded that the question was one of fact to be decided at trial. It also reinstated the cause of action for unjust enrichment, holding that the presence of an express contract did not foreclose recovery on a theory of quasi contract.</p>
<p class="indent">On this appeal, defendant’s principal contention is that no contract existed between the parties because the sale agreement lacked consideration. Underlying that argument is its assertion that an idea cannot be legally sufficient consideration unless it is novel. Plaintiffs insist that their system was indeed novel, but contend that, in any event, novelty is not required to validate the contract at issue here.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s cross motion for summary judgment insofar as it sought to dismiss the first cause of action alleging breach of contract was properly denied. Additionally, plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the lack of consideration defenses and counterclaims should be granted.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the traditional principles of contract law, the parties to a contract are free to make their bargain, even if the consideration exchanged is grossly unequal or of dubious value. Absent fraud or unconscionability, the adequacy of consideration is not a proper subject for judicial scrutiny. It is enough that something of “real value in the eye of the law” was exchanged. The fact that the sellers may not have had a property right in what they sold does not, by itself, render the contract void for lack of consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">Manifestly, defendant received something of value here; its own conduct establishes that. After signing the confidentiality agreement, defendant thoroughly reviewed plaintiffs’ system before buying it. Having done so, it was in the best position to know whether the idea had value. It decided to enter into the sale agreement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page494" class="pagebreak">494</span>and aggressively market the system to potential bond issuers. For at least a year, it was the only underwriter to use plaintiffs’ “book entry” system for municipal bonds, and it handled millions of such bond transactions during that time. Having obtained full disclosure of the system, used it in advance of competitors, and received the associated benefits of precluding its disclosure to others, defendant can hardly claim now the idea had no value to its municipal securities business. Indeed, defendant acknowledges it made payments to plaintiffs under the sale agreement for more than two years, conduct that would belie any claim it might make that the idea was lacking in value or that it had actually been obtained from some other source before plaintiffs’ disclosure.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, defendant has failed to demonstrate on this record that the contract was void or to raise a triable issue of fact on lack of consideration.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s position rests on <span class="italic">Downey v. General Foods Corp</span>., and <span class="italic">Soule v. Bon Ami Co.</span>, and similar decisions. It contends those cases establish an exception to traditional principles of contract law and require that the idea must be novel before it can constitute valid consideration for a contract. While our cases have discussed novelty as an element of an idea seller’s claim, it is not a discrete supplemental requirement, but simply part of plaintiff’s proof of either a proprietary interest in a claim based on a property theory or the validity of the consideration in a claim based on a contract theory.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Downey</span>, plaintiff submitted an idea for an advertising campaign. A short time later, defendant General Foods mounted a campaign that was similar to the one plaintiff had suggested and plaintiff sought damages in a complaint alleging several theories for recovery. We ordered the dismissal of the complaint on two separate grounds: first, the lack of novelty and, second, defendant’s prior possession of the idea—i.e., its lack of novelty as to defendant. To the extent plaintiff’s causes of action were grounded on assertions of a property right, we found that they were untenable “if the elements of novelty and originality [were] absent, since the property right in an idea is based upon these two elements.” Second, we concluded that the defendant possessed plaintiff’s ideas prior to plaintiff’s disclosure. Thus, the ideas could have no value to defendant and could not supply consideration for any agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Soule v. Bon Ami Co.</span>, plaintiff made an express contract with Bon Ami to disclose a way to increase profits. The idea consisted largely of a proposal to raise prices. The Appellate Division, in a frequently cited opinion, denied plaintiff any recovery, finding that the bargain lacked consideration because the idea was not novel. This Court affirmed but it did so on a different basis: it held that plaintiff had failed to show that profits resulted from the disclosure.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page495" class="pagebreak">495</div>
<p class="indent">These decisions do not support defendant’s contention that novelty is required in all cases involving disclosure of ideas. Indeed, we have explicitly held that it is not. <span class="italic">Downey</span>, <span class="italic">Soule</span> and cases in that line of decisions involve a distinct factual pattern: the buyer and seller contract for disclosure of the idea with payment based on use, but no separate postdisclosure contract for use of the idea has been made. Thus, they present the issue of whether the idea the buyer was using was, in fact, the seller’s.</p>
<p class="indent">Such transactions pose two problems for the courts. On the one hand, how can sellers prove that the buyer obtained the idea from them, and nowhere else, and that the buyer’s use of it thus constitutes misappropriation of property? Unlike tangible property, an idea lacks title and boundaries and cannot be rendered exclusive by the acts of the one who first thinks it. On the other hand, there is no equity in enforcing a seemingly valid contract when, in fact, it turns out upon disclosure that the buyer already possessed the idea. In such instances, the disclosure, though freely bargained for, is manifestly without value. A showing of novelty, at least novelty as to the buyer, addresses these two concerns. Novelty can then serve to establish both the attributes of ownership necessary for a property-based claim and the value of the consideration—the disclosure—necessary for contract-based claims.</p>
<p class="indent">There are no such concerns in a transaction such as the one before us. Defendant does not claim that it was aware of the idea before plaintiffs disclosed it but, rather, concedes that the idea came from them. When a seller’s claim arises from a contract to use an idea entered into after the disclosure of the idea, the question is not whether the buyer misappropriated property from the seller, but whether the idea had value to the buyer and thus constitutes valid consideration. In such a case, the buyer knows what he or she is buying and has agreed that the idea has value, and the Court will not ordinarily go behind that determination. The lack of novelty, in and of itself, does not demonstrate a lack of value. To the contrary, the buyer may reap benefits from such a contract in a number of ways—for instance, by not having to expend resources pursuing the idea through other channels or by having a profit-making idea implemented sooner rather than later.

<p id="sec224" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Dyer v. National By-Products</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Supreme Court of Iowa, 1986.</p>
<p class="sectionb">380 N.W.2d 732.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>CHULTZ</small>, J. The determinative issue in this appeal is whether good faith forbearance to litigate a claim, which proves to be invalid and unfounded, is sufficient consideration to uphold a contract of settlement. The district court determined, as a matter of law, that consideration for the alleged settlement was lacking because the forborne claim was not a viable cause of action. We reverse and remand.</p>
<p class="indent">On October 29, 1981, Dale Dyer, an employee of National By–Products, lost his right foot in a job-related accident. Thereafter, the employer placed Dyer on a leave of absence at full pay from the date of his injury until August 16, 1982. At that time he returned to work as a foreman, the job he held prior to his injury. On March 11, 1983, the employer indefinitely laid off Dyer.</p>
<p class="indent">Dyer then filed the present lawsuit against his employer claiming that his discharge was a breach of an oral contract. He alleged that he in good faith believed that he had a valid claim against his employer for his personal injury. Further, Dyer claimed that his forbearance from litigating his claim was made in exchange for a promise from his employer that he would have lifetime employment. The employer specifically denied that it had offered a lifetime job to Dyer after his injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Following extensive discovery procedures, the employer filed a motion for summary judgment claiming there was no genuine factual issue and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The motion was resisted by Dyer. The district court sustained the employer’s motion on the basis that: (1) no reciprocal promise to work for the employer for life was present, and (2) there was no forbearance of any viable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page497" class="pagebreak">497</span>cause of action, apparently on the ground that workers’ compensation provided Dyer’s sole remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">On appeal, Dyer claims that consideration for the alleged contract of lifetime employment was his forbearance from pursuing an action against his employer. Accordingly, he restricts his claim of error to the second reason advanced by the district court for granting summary judgment. Summary judgment is only proper when there is no genuine issue of any material fact. Dyer generally contends that an unresolved issue of material fact remains as to whether he reasonably and in good faith forbore from asserting a claim against his employer and his co-employees in exchange for the employer’s alleged promise to employ him for life. Specifically, he asserts that the trial court erred because: (1) the court did not consider the reasonableness and good faith of his belief in the validity of the claim he forbore from asserting, and (2) the court considered the legal merits of the claim itself which Dyer forbore from asserting.</p>
<p class="indent">The employer, on the other hand, maintains that workers’ compensation<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_107" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-107" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup> benefits are Dyer’s sole remedy for his injury and that his claim for damages is unfounded. It then urges that forbearance from asserting an unfounded claim cannot serve as consideration for a contract. For the purpose of this discussion, we shall assume that Dyer’s tort action is clearly invalid and he had no basis for a tort suit against either his employer or his fellow employees. We recognize that the fact issue, as to whether Dyer in good faith believed that he had a cause of action based in tort against the employer, remains unresolved. The determinative issue before the district court and now on appeal is whether the lack of consideration for the alleged promise of lifetime employment has been established as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="indent">Preliminarily, we observe that the law favors the adjustment and settlement of controversies without resorting to court action. Compromise of a doubtful right asserted in good faith is sufficient consideration for a promise.</p>
<p class="indent">The more difficult problem is whether the settlement of an unfounded claim asserted in good faith is consideration for a contract of settlement. Professor Corbin presents a view favorable to Dyer’s argument when he states:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[F]orbearance to press a claim, or a promise of such forbearance, may be a sufficient consideration even though the claim is wholly ill-founded. It may be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page498" class="pagebreak">498</span>ill-founded because the facts are not what he supposes them to be, or because the existing facts do not have the legal operation that he supposes them to have. In either case, his forbearance may be a sufficient consideration, although under certain circumstances it is not. The fact that the claim is ill-founded is not in itself enough to prevent forbearance from being a sufficient consideration for a promise.</p>
<p class="noindent">1 Corbin on Contracts § 140, at 595 (1963). Further, in the same section, it is noted that:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The most generally prevailing, and probably the most satisfactory view is that forbearance is sufficient if there is any reasonable ground for the claimant’s belief that it is just to try to enforce his claim. He must be asserting his claim “in good faith”; but this does not mean he must believe that his suit can be won. It means that he must not be making his claim or threatening suit for purposes of vexation, or in order to realize on its “nuisance value.”</p>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, we find support for the Corbin view in language contained in our cases.</p>
<p class="indent">The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 74 (1979), supports the Corbin view and states:</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(1) Forbearance to assert or the surrender of a claim or defense which proves to be invalid is not consideration unless</p>
<p class="list_alpha1">(a) the claim or defense is in fact doubtful because of uncertainty as to the facts or the law, or</p>
<p class="list_alpha1">(b) the forbearing or surrendering party believes that the claim or defense may be fairly determined to be valid.</p>
<p class="list_alphap">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="list_alpha2"><span class="italic">b. Requirement of good faith.</span> The policy favoring compromise of disputed claims is clearest, perhaps, where a claim is surrendered at a time when it is uncertain whether it is valid or not. Even though the invalidity later becomes clear, the bargain is to be judged as it appeared to the parties at the time; if the claim was then doubtful, no inquiry is necessary as to their good faith. Even though the invalidity should have been clear at the time, the settlement of an honest dispute is upheld. But a mere assertion or denial of liability does not make a claim doubtful, and the fact that invalidity is obvious may indicate that it was known. In such cases Subsection (1)(b) requires a showing of good faith.</p>
<p class="indent">However, not all jurisdictions adhere to this view. Some courts require that the claim forborne must have some merit in fact or at law before it can provide consideration and these jurisdictions reject those claims that are obviously invalid.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page499" class="pagebreak">499</div>
<p class="indent">In fact, we find language in our own case law that supports the view which is favorable to the employer in this case. Additionally, Professor Williston notes that:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">While there is a great divergence of opinion respecting the kind of forbearance which will constitute consideration, the weight of authority holds that although forbearance from suit on a clearly invalid claim is insufficient consideration for a promise, forbearance from suit on a claim of doubtful validity is sufficient consideration for a promise if there is a sincere belief in the validity of the claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">1 Williston on Contracts § 135 (3rd ed. 1957).</p>
<p class="indent">We believe, however, that the better reasoned approach is that expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 74. Even the above statement from Williston, although it may have been the state of the law in 1957, is a questionable assessment of the current law. In fact, most of the cases cited in the cumulative supplement to Williston follow the “good faith and reasonable” language. As noted before, as a matter of policy the law favors compromise and such policy would be defeated if a party could second guess his settlement and litigate the validity of the compromise. The requirement that the forbearing party assert the claim in good faith sufficiently protects the policy of law that favors the settlement of controversies. Our holdings which are to the contrary to this view are overruled.</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case, the invalidity of Dyer’s claim against the employer does not foreclose him, as a matter of law, from asserting that his forbearance was consideration for the alleged contract of settlement. However, the issue of Dyer’s good faith must still be examined. In so doing, the issue of the validity of Dyer’s claim should not be entirely overlooked:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Although the courts will not inquire into the validity of a claim which was compromised in good faith, there must generally be reasonable grounds for a belief in order for the court to be convinced that the belief was honestly entertained by the person who asserted it. Sufficient consideration requires more than the bald assertion by a claimant who has a claim, and to the extent that the validity or invalidity of a claim has a bearing upon whether there were reasonable grounds for believing in its possible validity, evidence of the validity or invalidity of a claim may be relevant to the issue of good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent">We conclude that the evidence of the invalidity of the claim is relevant to show a lack of honest belief in the validity of the claim asserted or forborne.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the present state of the record, there remains a material fact as to whether Dyer’s forbearance to assert his claim was in good faith. Summary judgment should not have been rendered against him. Accordingly, the case is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. What kind of evidence does Dyer need to bring at trial to prove that his belief that he could bring suit against National By–Products was in “good faith and reasonable”? Isn’t it more or less common knowledge that workers’ compensation is the only method of recovery against an employer for “on the job” accidents? What is the likelihood that National By–Products actually promised Dyer lifetime employment in exchange for dropping a tort suit clearly barred by the workers’ compensation statute?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Why is Baehr’s forbearance from repossessing his property for nonpayment of rent (a slam-dunk cause of action) not consideration, while Dyer’s forbearance from suing in tort may be, even though he has no cause of action as a matter of law? Certainly there is a procedural issue: Baehr’s case is a review of judgment notwithstanding the jury verdict after trial, while Dyer’s is a review of summary judgment. Baehr had the burden of showing there was sufficient evidence to uphold the jury verdict, while Dyer needed only to have a material issue of fact concerning the possible existence of the contract to escape summary judgment and go to trial. But is there a substantive issue that distinguishes the cases?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. How can forbearance from bringing a meritless suit be consideration? Doesn’t this encourage unscrupulous bullies to extract concessions by threatening meritless suits against those who are not legally savvy or lack the resources to defend?</p>

<p id="sec228" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Feld v. Henry S. Levy &amp; Sons</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1975.</p>
<p class="sectionb">37 N.Y.2d 466, 373 N.Y.S.2d 102, 335 N.E.2d 320.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>OOKE</small>, J. Plaintiff operates a business known as the Crushed Toast Company and defendant is engaged in the wholesale bread baking business. They entered into a written contract, as of June 19, 1968, in which defendant agreed to sell and plaintiff to purchase “all bread crumbs produced by the Seller in its factory at 115 Thames Street, Brooklyn, New York, during the period commencing June 19, 1968, and terminating June 18, 1969,” the agreement to “be deemed automatically renewed thereafter for successive renewal periods of one year” with the right to either party to cancel by giving not less than six months notice to the other by certified mail. No notice of cancellation was served. Additionally, pursuant to a contract stipulation, a faithful performance bond was delivered by plaintiff at the inception of the contractual relationship, and a bond continuation certificate was later submitted for the yearly term commencing June 19, 1969.</p>
<p class="indent">Interestingly, the term “bread crumbs” does not refer to crumbs that may flake off bread; rather, they are a manufactured item, starting with stale or imperfectly appearing loaves and followed by removal of labels, processing through two grinders, the second of which effects a finer granulation, insertion into a drum in an oven for toasting and, finally, bagging of the finished product.</p>
<p class="indent">Subsequent to the making of the agreement, a substantial quantity of bread crumbs, said to be over 250 tons, were sold by defendant to plaintiff but defendant stopped crumb production on about May 15, 1969. There was proof by defendant’s comptroller that the oven was too large to accommodate the drum, that it was stated that the operation was “very uneconomical,” but after said date of cessation no steps were taken to obtain more economical equipment. The toasting oven was intentionally broken down, then partially rebuilt, then completely dismantled in the summer of 1969 and, thereafter, defendant used the space for a computer room. It appears, without dispute, that defendant indicated to plaintiff at different times that the former would resume bread crumb production if the contract price of 6 cents per pound be changed to 7 cents, and also that, after the crumb making machinery <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page502" class="pagebreak">502</span>was dismantled, defendant sold the raw materials used in making crumbs to animal food manufacturers.</p>
<p class="indent">Special Term denied plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability and turned down defendant’s counter-request for a summary judgment of dismissal. From the Appellate Division’s order of affirmance, by a divided court, both parties appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant contends that the contract did not require defendant to manufacture bread crumbs, but merely to sell those it did, and, since none were produced after the demise of the oven, there was no duty to then deliver and, consequently from then on, no liability on its part. Agreements to sell all the goods or services a party may produce or perform to another party are commonly referred to as “output” contracts and they usually serve a useful commercial purpose in minimizing the burdens of product marketing. The Uniform Commercial Code rejects the ideas that an output contract is lacking in mutuality or that it is unenforceable because of indefiniteness in that a quantity for the term is not specified. Official Comment 2 to section 2–306 states in part: “Under this Article, a contract for output * * * is not too indefinite since it is held to mean the actual good faith output * * * of the particular party. Nor does such a contract lack mutuality of obligation since, under this section, the party who will determine quantity is required to operate his plant or conduct his business in good faith and according to commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his output * * * will proximate a reasonably foreseeable figure.”</p>
<p class="indent">The real issue in this case is whether the agreement carries with it an implication that defendant was obligated to continue to manufacture bread crumbs for the full term. Section 2–306 of the Uniform Commercial Code, entitled “Output, Requirements and Exclusive Dealings” provides:</p>
<p class="list">(1) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.</p>
<p class="list">(2) <span class="italic">A lawful agreement</span> by either the seller or the buyer <span class="italic">for exclusive dealing</span> in the kind of goods concerned <span class="italic">imposes</span> unless otherwise agreed an obligation <span class="italic">by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods</span> and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="noindent">The Official Comment thereunder reads in part:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Subsection (2), on exclusive dealing, makes explicit the commercial rule embodied in this Act under which the parties to such contracts are held to have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page503" class="pagebreak">503</span>impliedly, even when not expressly, bound themselves to use reasonable diligence as well as good faith in their performance of the contract. * * * An exclusive dealing agreement brings into play all of the good faith aspects of the output and requirement problems of subsection (1). It also raises questions of insecurity and right to adequate assurance under this Article.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 2–306 is consistent with prior New York case law. Every contract of this type imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance (Uniform Commercial Code, § 1–203). Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the commercial background and intent must be read into the language of any agreement and good faith is demanded in the performance of that agreement and, under the decisions relating to output contracts, it is clearly the general rule that good faith cessation of production terminates any further obligations thereunder and excuses further performance by the party discontinuing production.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not a situation where defendant ceased its main operation of bread baking. Rather, defendant contends in a conclusory fashion that it was “uneconomical” or “economically not feasible” for it to continue to make bread crumbs. Although plaintiff observed in his motion papers that defendant claimed it was not economically feasible to make the crumbs, plaintiff did not admit that as a fact. In any event, “economic feasibility,” an expression subject to many interpretations, would not be a precise or reliable test.</p>
<p class="indent">There are present here intertwined questions of fact, whether defendant performed in good faith and whether it stopped its manufacture of bread crumbs in good faith, neither of which can be resolved properly on this record. The seller’s duty to remain in crumb production is a matter calling for a close scrutiny of its motives confined here by the papers to financial reasons. It is undisputed that defendant leveled its crumb making machinery only after plaintiff refused to agree to a price higher than that specified in the agreement and that it then sold the raw materials to manufacturers of animal food. There are before us no componential figures indicating the actual cost of the finished bread crumbs to defendant, statements as to the profits derived or the losses sustained, or data specifying the net or gross return realized from the animal food transactions.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties by their contract gave the right of cancellation to either by providing for a six months’ notice to the other. The apparent purpose of such a stipulation was to provide an opportunity to either the seller or buyer to conclude their dealings in the event that the transactions were not as profitable or advantageous as desired or expected, or for any other reason. Correspondingly, such a notice would also furnish the receiver of it a chance to secure another outlet or source of supply, as the case might be. Short of such a cancellation, defendant was expected to continue to perform in good faith and could cease production of the bread crumbs, a single facet of its operation, only in good faith. Obviously, a bankruptcy or genuine imperiling of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page504" class="pagebreak">504</span>the very existence of its entire business caused by the production of the crumbs would warrant cessation of production of that item; the yield of less profit from its sale than expected would not. Since bread crumbs were but a part of defendant’s enterprise and since there was a contractual right of cancellation, good faith required continued production until cancellation, even if there be no profit. In circumstances such as these and without more, defendant would be justified, in good faith, in ceasing production of the single item prior to cancellation only if its losses from continuance would be more than trivial, which, overall, is a question of fact.</p>
<p class="indent">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>

<p id="sec230" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Technical Assistance International v. United States</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">U.S. Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit, 1998.</p>
<p class="sectionb">150 F.3d 1369.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ B<small>RYSON</small>, J. This case requires us to determine how much freedom the government has to vary its requirements when it enters into a requirements contract. The government entered into a requirements contract with Technical Assistance International, Inc., (TAI), pursuant to which TAI was to maintain and repair the Army’s vehicle fleet at the White Sands Missile Range. The United States Court of Federal Claims held that when the government increased the rate at which it replaced the older vehicles in the fleet, and thus decreased its requirements for vehicle maintenance and repair services, the government violated its contractual obligations to TAI. We reverse.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">In early 1992, the Army consolidated its fleet of general purpose vehicles at the White Sands Missile Range into the Interagency Fleet Management System. The Interagency Fleet Management System is a federal agency service program under which the General Services Administration (GSA) assumes ownership of and maintenance responsibilities for fleets of vehicles formerly owned and maintained by various federal agencies. The purpose of the program is to achieve economies of scale in the purchasing, management, and servicing of such fleets.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page505" class="pagebreak">505</div>
<p class="indent">The average age of the vehicles in the Army’s White Sands fleet before being transferred into the GSA program was eight years. One of the Army’s goals in consolidating its fleet into the GSA program was to bring the fleet up to GSA standards, which call for vehicles to be replaced after three to six years of use (depending on vehicle type and mileage). Because GSA could not afford to replace all of the Army’s old vehicles at once, it committed itself to bringing the Army’s fleet up to its replacement standard over a five-year period. Of particular relevance to this case, GSA and the Army agreed that during the first year of consolidation, GSA would replace at least 30% of the vehicles eligible for replacement, and perhaps a higher percentage if it had the resources to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">GSA does not service and repair vehicles itself, but instead hires on-site contractors to perform those services. On November 15, 1991, GSA issued a bid solicitation for a requirements contract for the maintenance and repair of the White Sands vehicle fleet. As part of that solicitation, GSA prepared an estimate of the fleet’s maintenance and repair needs, itemized by service types. Because GSA had not previously procured maintenance services for the White Sands fleet, it did not have any historic bid or price data to use in formulating the estimate. Instead, GSA based its estimate on a number of factors, including the number and types of vehicles in the fleet, the terrain and typical use of vehicles at White Sands, a review of GSA service contracts at similar sites, and GSA’s commitment to replace at least 30% of the vehicles eligible for replacement during the first year of consolidation.</p>
<p class="indent">GSA awarded the contract to TAI on March 30, 1992. The contract term began on May 1, 1992, and was to run for one year, with two one-year options to renew at the government’s discretion. Within two months of beginning performance, TAI projected that the work required for the White Sands fleet was going to fall considerably short of GSA’s estimate. TAI submitted a request for an equitable adjustment based on the projected shortfall, as well as a certified claim for compensation based on a charge that GSA’s contract estimate was prepared negligently. GSA denied the requested relief.</p>
<p class="indent">TAI subsequently filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims. The complaint alleged that TAI suffered damages as a result of the government’s negligent estimate preparation. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled that the government had not been negligent in the preparation of its estimate, but the court nonetheless held that the government had breached its obligations under the contract and that TAI was entitled to relief.</p>
<p class="indent">In reaching its decision, the court relied on testimony from Virlene Griffin, the Group Leader of Operations for GSA’s Fleet Maintenance Division, that during the first year of consolidation, GSA replaced more than twice the number of vehicles it had expected to replace. Ms. Griffin testified that there were a number of factors that resulted in the accelerated replacement rate, including the downsizing of GSA <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page506" class="pagebreak">506</span>fleets at several nearby locations, the grant of permission from the Office of Management and Budget for GSA to acquire new cars through leasing as well as purchasing, and the delivery of new vehicles that had been ordered before the consolidation of the Army’s fleet.</p>
<p class="indent">The court held that when a contractor enters into a requirements contract, it assumes only the risk of a change in requirements caused by to the “vagaries of user demand.” The court regarded the accelerated rate at which GSA replaced the fleet’s older cars to have been prompted by fleet surpluses at other locations, rather than by a change in the “indigenous needs” of the facility that TAI contracted to serve. The court reasoned that TAI had not assumed the risk that GSA would increase the rate of replacement of the White Sands fleet in the event other GSA fleets developed a surplus. For that reason, the court concluded that when the government reduced its requirements by increasing the replacement rate for the White Sands fleet, the government effected a constructive change in the contract and breached its contractual obligations to TAI.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">A</span></p>
<p class="indent">A requirements contract is primarily designed to provide a buyer with flexibility in operating its business. The buyer is likely to enter into such a contract when its needs are unpredictable and it wishes to preserve for itself the freedom to determine its level of consumption and to conduct its operations according to its best business judgment. The buyer is generally accorded significant freedom in determining its requirements under a requirements contract because it has specifically bargained for such flexibility, in exchange for which it has usually agreed to pay a premium price for the goods or services to be provided.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, the law imposes some limits on the buyer, lest it be permitted to vary its requirements to such an extent that the seller is exposed to an undue risk of severe economic hardship.</p>
<p class="indent">The limitation on the buyer’s freedom to vary its requirements is usually expressed as a duty to act in good faith.</p>
<p class="indent">A buyer acts in good faith if it has a valid business reason for varying its requirements other than dissatisfaction with the contract. “Bad faith” includes actions “motivated solely by a reassessment of the balance of advantages and disadvantages under the contract.” That is, if the buyer “had second thoughts about the terms of the contract,” and decreased its requirements in an attempt to avoid its obligations under the contract, the buyer is deemed to have endeavored to manipulate the contract and thus to have acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="indent">The Uniform Commercial Code contains a separate restriction on the buyer’s freedom to vary its requirements, see Uniform Commercial Code § 2–306(1) (buyer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page507" class="pagebreak">507</span>of goods cannot demand a quantity “unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimates”), but it is unclear how much that additional restriction adds to the obligation of good faith. In any event, the Uniform Commercial Code is not binding with respect to government contracts, and we decline to adopt the Uniform Commercial Code standard here.</p>
<p class="indent">TAI argues that another limitation should restrict the government’s ability to vary its requirements: A variation should not be permitted if it is occasioned by a decision on the part of the government that “materially alter[s] factors upon which the estimates are based.” According to TAI, if the government makes any decisions that affect the factors that formed the basis for the contract estimate, the government must compensate the contractor for any losses it suffers as a result.</p>
<p class="indent">We reject TAI’s proposed limitation, because it would severely hamper the government’s ability to adjust its requirements in accordance with its true needs and thus would undermine the primary function of a requirements contract—to permit the government to operate its business according to its business judgment when its needs are uncertain or unpredictable. In essence, TAI’s limitation would require the government to commit itself “to go through with whatever project generated the estimate of required quantity, no matter what happened over the life of the project,” a result that has been clearly rejected by the long line of cases that have permitted buyers to discontinue their businesses and thereby eliminate their requirements altogether, as long as they do so in good faith.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, we hold that the only limitation upon the government’s ability to vary its requirements under a requirements contract is that it must do so in good faith. Our holding is in accord with numerous decisions from other courts. That rule has the benefit of simplicity, and it enables the government to take full advantage of the flexibility for which it has bargained. Of course, the seller can control the risk that a requirements contract may result in harsh consequences by incorporating minimum and maximum quantity terms, or other similar provisions, into the contract.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">B</span></p>
<p class="indent">The party alleging a breach of contract bears the burden of proving the breach. Thus, in a requirements contract case in which the seller alleges that the buyer breached the contract by reducing its requirements, the burden of proof is on the seller to prove that the buyer acted in bad faith, for example, by reducing its requirements solely in order to avoid its obligations under the contract. In the absence of such a showing, the buyer will be presumed to have varied its requirements for valid business reasons, i.e., to have acted in good faith, and will not be liable for the change in requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case, TAI has neither alleged nor shown that the government altered its requirements in bad faith. The government introduced evidence that it had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page508" class="pagebreak">508</span>valid business reasons for incorporating available new vehicles into the White Sands fleet. Specifically, doing so enabled the government to “suffer less downtime” and resulted in “making a better fleet.” TAI has not pointed to any evidence showing that the government’s reduction in requirements was “motivated solely by a reassessment of the balance of advantages and disadvantages under the contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">This case is very similar to <span class="italic">Southwest Natural Gas Co</span>. [<span class="italic">v. Oklahoma Portland Cement Co.</span>] in which the buyer in a requirements contract reduced its gas requirements as a result of having replaced an old, worn-out boiler with a new, more efficient boiler. The court concluded that the buyer did not breach the contract because it improved its plant “in good faith and in the exercise of prudent business judgment.” In this case, there was uncontroverted evidence that the government increased the vehicle replacement rate in a similar attempt to improve its fleet. Because the government “had a business reason for deciding [to make use of available new vehicles] that was independent of the terms of the contract … with [TAI],” the government acted in good faith. Accordingly, the government did not breach or constructively change its contract with TAI.</p>
<p id="sec231" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Note that the court expressly does not adopt the UCC rule for government contracts. If the court had applied UCC § 2–306 in this case, would the outcome have been different?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Notice that the trial court held that when a contractor enters into a requirements contract, it assumes only the risk of a change in requirements caused by the “vagaries of user demand,” but the appellate court found no such limitation in the contract. Assume that TAI is willing to bear the risk of vagaries of user demand, but not the risk that the Government will alter the nature of the fleet or other risks that reflect changed circumstances at White Sands. How would you suggest it avoid bearing such risks in the future? What if it doesn’t want to bear all the risk of vagaries of user demand?</p>

<p class="indent">If a bargain is essential to an enforceable promise, a promise based on something that the promisor already has is obviously not enforceable. There can be no present <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page509" class="pagebreak">509</span>exchange in such a circumstance and therefore, <span class="italic">a fortiori,</span> no consideration as defined by Restatement, Second, Contracts § 71. This logical point has caused difficulty in the law of contract, for many a promise is made out of gratitude or a feeling of obligation for what the promisee did for the promisor in the past.

<p id="sec233" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Passante v. McWilliam</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">California Court of Appeal, 1997.</p>
<p class="sectionb">53 Cal.App.4th 1240, 62 Cal.Rptr.2d 298.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>ILLS</small>, P<small>RESIDING</small> J<small>USTICE</small>. As someone once said, if you build it they will come. And by the same token, if you make a baseball card that can’t be counterfeited, they will buy it. Which brings us to the case at hand.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1988 the Upper Deck Company was a rookie baseball card company with an idea for a better baseball card: one that had a hologram on it. Holograms protect credit cards from counterfeiting, and the promoters of the company thought they could protect baseball cards as well. By the 1990’s the Upper Deck would become a major corporation whose value was at least a quarter of a billion dollars. Collecting baseball cards, like baseball itself, is big business.</p>
<p class="indent">But the outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Upper Deck back in the summer of 1988. It lacked the funds for a $100,000 deposit it needed to buy some special paper by August 1, and without that deposit its contract with the major league baseball players association would have been jeopardized.</p>
<p class="indent">The Upper Deck’s corporate attorney, Anthony Passante, then came through in the clutch. Passante found the money from the brother of his law partner, and, on the morning of July 29, had it wired to a company controlled by one of the directors. That evening, the directors of the company accepted the loan and, in gratitude, agreed among themselves that the corporate attorney should have three percent of the firm’s stock. The rest is history. Instead of striking out, the Upper Deck struck it rich.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, if we may be forgiven the mixed metaphor, we must change gears. No good deed goes unpunished. Anthony Passante never sought to collect the inchoate gift of stock, and later, the company just outright reneged on its promise. Passante sued for breach of oral contract, and the jury awarded him close to $33 million—the value of three percent of the Upper Deck at the time of trial in 1993.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial judge, however, granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, largely because he concluded that Passante had violated his ethical duty as a lawyer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page510" class="pagebreak">510</span>to his client. There was no dispute that Passante did not tell the board that it might want to consult with another lawyer before it made its promise. Nor did Passante advise the board of the complications which might arise from his being given three percent of the stock.</p>
<p class="indent">The board had a clear moral obligation to honor its promise to Passante. He had, as the baseball cliche goes, stepped up to the plate and homered on the Upper Deck’s behalf. And if this court could enforce such moral obligations, we would advise the company even yet to pay something in honor of its promise.</p>
<p class="indent">But the trial judge was right. If the promise was bargained for, it was obtained in violation of Passante’s ethical obligations as an attorney. If, on the other hand, it was not bargained for—as the record here clearly shows—it was gratuitous. It was therefore legally unenforceable, even though it might have moral force. We must therefore, with perhaps a degree of reluctance, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">F<small>ACTS AND</small> P<small>ROCEDURAL</small> H<small>ISTORY</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The Upper Deck Company was formed in March 1988 to produce baseball cards with holograms. The initial directors were Paul Sumner, William Hemrick, Boris Korbel, Richard P. McWilliam, Angels’ pitcher DeWayne Buice and Anthony Passante. Passante, who was already the personal attorney for Korbel and McWilliam, was appointed corporate attorney and secretary. McWilliam, an accountant with contacts to a number of investors, had the responsibility of obtaining start-up financing for the company. Passante made no investment in the company and owned no stock.</p>
<p class="indent">Upper Deck needed $100,000 to put on deposit with an Italian paper company by August 1, 1988, so the paper would be available for the inaugural run of baseball cards planned for December. Without the paper, the company risked losing its license with major league baseball.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_108" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-108" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> However, as of July 26, 1988, the company had not obtained financing. To make matters worse, McWilliam was demanding more stock in return for the financing he was supposed to obtain. Board members instructed Passante to demand the return of McWilliam’s 11 percent stock if he would not change his demands.</p>
<p class="indent">When Passante found out that McWilliam would not be coming up with the money, he told his law partner, Andy Prendiville that “there was really no hope for the company to make it.” Prendiville asked Passante if he should talk to his brother, who was a doctor and might be able to make a loan of $100,000. Passante told Prendiville to call his brother, who said that he “was in a position to loan the money and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page511" class="pagebreak">511</span>would do so.” Both Passante and Prendiville spoke to Korbel concerning the availability of “those funds.” They told Korbel “that the funds were available.”</p>
<p class="indent">Korbel then requested that Passante come to a special board meeting to be held on the evening of July 29, 1988 “in order to talk to the other two shareholders about that loan.” Korbel said he wanted the other shareholders to be a party to the loan. And, because the shareholders would be guaranteeing the repayment of the funds, Korbel “wanted to make sure that he had the agreement of his co-shareholders for that type of an arrangement.”</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Kevin Prendiville wired $100,000 to an account controlled by Korbel just a little after 11 a.m. on July 29, 1988, though Passante still understood that if the board did not approve the loan “it wasn’t going to be made.”</p>
<p class="indent">At the board meeting that evening, Passante told the assembled board members (assembled without notice to McWilliam) “about the availability of the funds.” He asked them “if they would be interested in obtaining the money from Dr. Prendiville.” The board members agreed.</p>
<p class="indent">The board members were “all quite excited about the availability of those funds.” Korbel “brought up” the idea that the board should consider giving Passante some ownership interest if he got the loan, and Hemrick said, “Look, if you can get that money for us then I think you’re entitled to three percent of the company.” There was “general agreement” among the board members “that that would be the case.” Passante said, “Okay. We’ll do the loan,” and then went back to his office.</p>
<p class="indent">Passante drafted a note which did not have an interest rate on it. However, at Korbel’s insistence, an extra $10,000 was paid to Dr. Prendiville for the 90–day loan. The Upper Deck made its deposit.</p>
<p class="indent">The day after the deadline, the board members were “quite happy people.” At a meeting held that day, the board members discussed how McWilliam’s 11 percent would be divided; “it was determined” that Passante would receive 3 percent from McWilliam’s 11 percent, and Korbel would receive the 8 percent balance.</p>
<p class="indent">Passante’s three percent, however, was “to be held by Boris Korbel.” The idea was that Korbel would hold Passante’s interest in the company until McWilliam returned his stock certificate, and, when a new investor was brought in and new certificates were issued, Passante would receive his stock.</p>
<p class="indent">But the Upper Deck still needed financing, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to enlist a New York firm, Korbel told Passante that maybe McWilliam should be brought back into the company after all. Passante told Korbel that he “should do whatever he thought necessary to make the company go forward.”</p>
<p class="indent">What Korbel thought necessary was to contact McWilliam. On August 31, 1988, Korbel told Passante about Korbel’s conversation with McWilliam. McWilliam, it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page512" class="pagebreak">512</span>seemed, was “extremely upset” at Passante “because of what had occurred at the end of July.” Accordingly, McWilliam would only “invest in Upper Deck” on the condition that Passante “not participate as an owner of the company.” Korbel told Passante that “in order to get the company going” Korbel would hold Passante’s three percent for him and “we wouldn’t tell Mr. McWilliam or any of the other shareholders about this interest.” After McWilliam “cool[ed] off” and everything was “smooth again,” Korbel would discuss Passante’s three percent interest and either “get a stock certificate representing that interest from the corporation,” or Korbel would at least make sure Passante “obtained the benefit of that three percent through him” by way of profit distributions from the company.</p>
<p class="indent">In early fall McWilliam came back into the company; McWilliam soon brought in Richard Kughn, a Chicago investor. As a result, the shares of the company were redistributed, leaving Korbel, McWilliam and Kughn each with 26 percent. After Kughn made his investment, Passante was fired as corporate attorney because Kughn wanted the company represented by a large law firm.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1988 and early 1989, Korbel told Passante that he need not be concerned about the three percent—that Korbel “had it” and he “would take care of it” for Passante. In November 1990, however, at a restaurant in Orange, Korbel told Passante that he wasn’t going to get his three percent. In essence, Kughn had been given Passante’s three percent in the redistribution of stock occasioned by Kughn’s investment.</p>
<p class="indent">The next month Passante filed this lawsuit. Andy Prendiville was also named as a plaintiff because Passante told him, after the August 2 meeting, that “because of his being so instrumental in obtaining the $100,000 loan” “half of whatever [Passante] got was his.”</p>
<p class="indent">As set forth in his second amended complaint, Passante sued McWilliam for intentional interference with prospective advantage, negligent interference with economic relationship, bad faith, breach of fiduciary duty, bad faith denial of contract, conversion, intentional interference with contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, intentional fraudulent misrepresentation, and equitable estoppel. He sued Upper Deck for negligent interference with economic relationship, bad faith, bad faith denial of contract, conversion, unjust enrichment, intentional fraudulent misrepresentation, and equitable estoppel. He sued Boris Korbel for negligent interference with economic relationship, bad faith, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of oral contract, bad faith denial of contract, conversion, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, constructive trust, unjust enrichment, intentional fraudulent misrepresentation, and equitable estoppel.</p>
<p class="indent">Passante did not sue the Upper Deck for breach of oral contract.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page513" class="pagebreak">513</div>
<p class="indent">All breach of fiduciary duty and intentional fraudulent misrepresentation claims were dismissed pursuant to sustained demurrers. The bad faith, fraud and negligent misrepresentation were dismissed pursuant to stipulation after the trial court refused, as a sanction for not having disclosed the identity of the witness during discovery, to allow Passante to present the testimony of Daniel Lybarger, a former controller of the Upper Deck, who would have testified that McWilliam actually knew that Passante had been given three percent of the company’s stock.</p>
<p class="indent">After the close of the plaintiffs’ case, the trial judge granted nonsuit motions which eliminated all remaining claims against McWilliam, the Upper Deck, and Korbel except the 11th cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty and imposition of a constructive trust against Korbel only. However, the trial judge also granted Passante’s request to add a claim for breach of oral contract against the Upper Deck.</p>
<p class="indent">The claim against the Upper Deck and the claim against Korbel went to the jury. The jury found for Passante and awarded him some $32 million against Upper Deck and $1 million against Korbel. The Upper Deck then moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, a new trial; the trial court granted both. The trial judge also determined that the sole remaining claim against Korbel was equitable in nature and, in a tentative decision issued July 2, 1993, gave judgment for Korbel on that claim, finding that there was no transaction between Korbel and Passante “which could serve as a basis for imposing a constructive trust.”</p>
<p class="indent">Two formal judgments were filed August 3, 1993, one in favor of both the Upper Deck and McWilliam, the other in favor of Korbel on the equitable cause of action. Passante then filed this appeal from those judgments.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">In his opening brief Passante asserts that “[a]n enforceable contract requires only a promise capable of being enforced and consideration to support the promise.” As framed, the assertion is incomplete. Consideration must also be given in exchange for the promise. Past consideration cannot support a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Cases relied on by Passante merely demonstrate the rule that the extinguishment of a preexisting obligation, or the rendering of past services with the expectation of future payment, constitute sufficient consideration for a contract….</p>
<p class="indent">As a matter of law, any claim by Passante for breach of contract necessarily founders on the rule that consideration must result from a bargain.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus if the stock promise was truly bargained for, then he had an obligation to the Upper Deck, as its counsel, to give the firm the opportunity to have separate counsel represent it in the course of that bargaining. The legal profession has certain rules regarding business transactions with clients. Rule 3–300 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct forbids members from entering “a business transaction <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page514" class="pagebreak">514</span>with a client” without first advising the client “in writing that the client may seek the advice of an independent lawyer of the client’s choice.”</p>
<p class="indent">Here it is undisputed that Passante did not advise the Upper Deck of the need for independent counsel in connection with its promise, either in writing or even orally. Had he done so before the Upper Deck made its promise, the board of directors might or might not have been so enthusiastic about his finding the money as to give away three percent of the stock. In a business transaction with a client, notes our Supreme Court, a lawyer is obligated to give “his client ‘all that reasonable advice against himself that he would have given him against a third person.’” Bargaining between the parties might have resulted in Passante settling for just a reasonable finder’s fee. Independent counsel would likely have at least reminded the board members of the obvious—that a grant of stock to Passante might complicate future capital acquisition.</p>
<p class="indent">For better or worse, there is an inherent conflict of interest created by any situation in which the corporate attorney for a fledgling company in need of capital accepts stock as a reward for past service. As events in this case proved out, had the gift of 3 percent of the company’s stock been completed, it would have made the subsequent capital acquisition much more difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">Passante’s rejoinder to the ethics issue is, as we have noted, to point to the evidence that the stock was virtually thrust at him in return for what he had done. The terms were totally dictated by the Upper Deck board. And that is it, precisely. There was no bargaining.</p>
<p class="indent">But a close reading of the facts shows that the stock had not been bargained for in exchange for arranging the loan; Passante had already arranged the loan (even though the loan had not been formally accepted by the board) before the idea of giving him stock was ever brought up. There is no evidence that Passante had any expectation that he be given stock in return for arranging the $100,000 loan. Clearly, all of Passante’s services had already been rendered by the time the idea of giving Passante some stock was proposed. As the court in <span class="italic">Dow</span> plainly stated, “if there was no expectation of payment by either party when the services were rendered, the promise is a mere promise to make a gift and not enforceable.”</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C<small>ONCLUSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The promise of three percent of the stock was not a reward contract; it was Passante who first told Korbel that “funds were available.” It was simply, to use a phrase usually associated with life insurance contracts, an inchoate gift—that is, an unenforceable promise from a grateful corporate board. Like the corporate resolution in <span class="italic">Dow</span>, it represented a moral obligation. And like the corporate resolution in <span class="italic">Dow</span>, it was legally unenforceable. (See Dow v. River Farms Co., 110 Cal.App.2d 403 (1952) [company executive rendered services without expectation of payment, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page515" class="pagebreak">515</span>thus subsequent promise by board to pay him $50,000 for those services as soon as the company became free of floating indebtedness was unenforceable].)<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_109" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-109" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup></p>
<p id="sec234" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. <span class="italic">Passante</span> refers to Rule 3-300 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct. Under new Rules of Professional Conduct proposed by the State Bar of California this rule will be renumbered Rule 1.8.1 but will remain substantially unchanged.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Is the court saying there is no promise here, or that there is no consideration for the promise?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The court makes a fuss about Passante’s lack of informing Upper Deck that it has a right to counsel before engaging in contractual relations with him. If the facts are as described (Passante arranged for the loan completely before the board decided to reward him for his efforts), would it have mattered if Passante immediately told the board of its right to independent counsel and followed it up with a written notice? What if Passante was Upper Deck’s accountant rather than its attorney? Would he be entitled to three percent then?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Is the lesson of <span class="italic">Passante</span> not to be too proactive and instead to bargain expressly for every service rendered? Isn’t it clear that if Passante had just said to the board, “If you promise to give me a three percent share of the company, I will find the funds to make the $100,000 payment” and the board accepted, a contract would have been formed and he would have been entitled to damages based on the value of three percent of the company?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. Would the result of this case bother you more if Passante had spent a month calling in favors of all his friends and acquaintances and wining and dining new potential investors to arrange the loan? According to the reasoning of the court, would such facts change the outcome? Are there other grounds on which Passante could recover?</p>

<p id="sec235" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Mills v. Wyman</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, 1825.</p>
<p class="sectionb">20 Mass. (3 Pick.) 207.</p>
<p class="indent">This was an action of <span class="italic">assumpsit</span> brought to recover a compensation for the board, nursing, &amp; c., of Levi Wyman, son of the defendant, from the 5th to the 20th of February, 1821. The plaintiff then lived at Hartford, in Connecticut; the defendant, at Shrewsbury, in this county. Levi Wyman, at the time when the services were rendered, was about 25 years of age, and had long ceased to be a member of his father’s family. He was on his return from a voyage at sea, and being suddenly taken sick at Hartford, and being poor and in distress, was relieved by the plaintiff in the manner and to the extent above stated. On the 24th of February, after all the expenses had been incurred, the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff, promising to pay him such expenses. There was no consideration for this promise, except what grew out of the relation which subsisted between Levi Wyman and the defendant, and Howe, J., before whom the cause was tried in the Court of Common Pleas, thinking this not sufficient to support the action, directed a nonsuit. To this direction the plaintiff filed exceptions.</p>
<p class="indent">P<small>ARKER</small>, C.J. General rules of law established for the protection and security of honest and fair-minded men, who may inconsiderately make promises without any equivalent, will sometimes screen men of a different character from engagements which they are bound <span class="italic">in foro conscientiae</span> to perform. This is a defect inherent in all human systems of legislation. The rule that a mere verbal promise, without any consideration, cannot be enforced by action, is universal in its application, and cannot be departed from to suit particular cases in which a refusal to perform such a promise may be disgraceful.</p>
<p class="indent">The promise declared on in this case appears to have been made without any legal consideration. The kindness and services towards the sick son of the defendant were not bestowed at his request. The son was in no respect under the care of the defendant. He was twenty-five years old, and had long left his father’s family. On his return from a foreign country, he fell sick among strangers, and the plaintiff acted the part of the good Samaritan, giving him shelter and comfort until he died. The defendant, his father, on being informed of this event, influenced by a transient feeling of gratitude, promises in writing to pay the plaintiff for the expenses he had incurred. But he has determined to break this promise, and is willing to have his case appear on record as a strong example of particular injustice sometimes necessarily resulting from the operation of general rules.</p>
<p class="indent">It is said a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support an express promise; and some authorities lay down the rule thus broadly; but upon examination of the cases we are satisfied that the universality of the rule cannot be supported, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page517" class="pagebreak">517</span>and that there must have been some preexisting obligation, which has become inoperative by positive law, to form a basis for an effective promise. The cases of debts barred by the statute of limitations, of debts incurred by infants, of debts of bankrupts, are generally put for illustration of the rule. Express promises founded on such preexisting equitable obligations may be enforced; there is a good consideration for them; they merely remove an impediment created by law to the recovery of debts honestly due, but which public policy protects the debtors from being compelled to pay. In all these cases there was originally a <span class="italic">quid pro quo;</span> and according to the principles of natural justice the party receiving ought to pay; but the legislature has said he shall not be coerced; then comes the promise to pay the debt that is barred, the promise of the man to pay the debt of the infant, of the discharged bankrupt to restore to his creditor what by the law he had lost. In all these cases there is a moral obligation founded upon an antecedent valuable consideration. These promises therefore have a sound legal basis. They are not promises to pay something for nothing; not naked pacts; but the voluntary revival or creation of obligation which before existed in natural law, but which had been dispensed with, not for the benefit of the party obliged solely, but principally for the public convenience. If moral obligation, in its fullest sense, is a good substratum for an express promise, it is not easy to perceive why it is not equally good to support an implied promise. What a man ought to do, generally he ought to be made to do, whether he promise or refuse. But the law of society has left most of such obligations to the <span class="italic">interior</span> forum, as the tribunal of conscience has been aptly called. Is there not a moral obligation upon every son who has become affluent by means of the education and advantages bestowed upon him by his father, to relieve that father from pecuniary embarrassment, to promote his comfort and happiness, and even to share with him his riches, if thereby he will be made happy? And yet such a son may, with impunity, leave such a father in any degree of penury above that which will expose the community in which he dwells, to the danger of being obliged to preserve him from absolute want. Is not a wealthy father under strong moral obligation to advance the interest of an obedient, well disposed son, to furnish him with the means of acquiring and maintaining a becoming rank in life, to rescue him from the horrors of debt incurred by misfortune? Yet the law will uphold him in any degree of parsimony, short of that which would reduce his son to the necessity of seeking public charity.</p>
<p class="indent">Without doubt there are great interests of society which justify withholding the coercive arm of the law from these duties of imperfect obligation, as they are called; imperfect, not because they are less binding upon the conscience than those which are called perfect, but because the wisdom of the social law does not impose sanctions upon them.</p>
<p class="indent">A deliberate promise, in writing, made freely and without any mistake, one which may lead the party to whom it is made into contracts and expenses, cannot be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page518" class="pagebreak">518</span>broken without a violation of moral duty. But if there was nothing paid or promised for it, the law, perhaps, wisely, leaves the execution of it to the conscience of him who makes it. It is only when the party making the promise gains something, or he to whom it is made loses something, that the law gives the promise validity. And in the case of the promise of the adult to pay the debt of the infant, of the debtor discharged by the statute of limitations or bankruptcy, the principal is preserved by looking back to the origin of the transaction, where an equivalent is to be found. An exact equivalent is not required by the law; for there being a consideration, the parties are left to estimate its value: though here the courts of equity will step in to relieve from gross inadequacy between the consideration and the promise.</p>
<p class="indent">These principles are deduced from the general current of decided cases upon the subject as well as from the known maxims of the common law. The general position, that moral obligation is a sufficient consideration for an express promise, is to be limited in its application, to cases where at some time or other a good or valuable consideration has existed.</p>
<p class="indent">The cases of instruments under seal and certain mercantile contracts, in which considerations need not be proved, do not contradict the principles above suggested. The first import a consideration in themselves, and the second belong to a branch of the mercantile law, which has found it necessary to disregard the point of consideration in respect to instruments negotiable in their nature and essential to the interests of commerce.</p>

<p id="sec236" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Chief Justice Parker says on p. 517, “What a man ought to do, generally he ought to be made to do, whether he promise or refuse.” Do you agree? Even if there were no promise in this case, don’t you think father Wyman should have compensated the stranger who kindly took care of his poor and distressed son during his last illness? Why does Chief Justice Parker feel compelled to reach a result he knows is unjust? Don’t judges have power to do justice? Part of the answer is likely to be that somehow moral obligations are less worthy of enforcement than commercial obligations. You will encounter this attitude repeatedly in your studies, but it may remain a puzzle. Why should the law be so afraid of enforcing promises motivated by the feelings of the heart?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Chief Justice Parker points out that the law has always enforced promises supported by certain obligations unenforceable at law. The most common are promises <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page519" class="pagebreak">519</span>to pay debts barred by the statute of limitations, discharged in bankruptcy, or voidable because made by an infant or an incompetent. Do the principles of natural justice invoked by Chief Justice Parker satisfactorily distinguish such cases from the situation in <span class="italic">Mills v. Wyman</span>? Where should we look to find these principles and how can we tell whether they are as much in force today as they were in 1825?</p>

<p id="sec237" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Webb v. McGowin</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Alabama Court of Appeals, 1935.</p>
<p class="sectionb">27 Ala.App. 82, 168 So. 196.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ B<small>RICKEN</small>, P<small>RESIDING</small> J<small>UDGE</small>. This action is in assumpsit. The complaint as originally filed was amended. The demurrers to the complaint as amended were sustained, and because of this adverse ruling by the court the plaintiff took a nonsuit, and the assignment of errors on this appeal are predicated upon said action or ruling of the court.</p>
<p class="indent">A fair statement of the case presenting the questions for decision is set out in appellant’s brief, which we adopt.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">On the 3d day of August, 1925, appellant while in the employ of the W.T. Smith Lumber Company, a corporation, and acting within the scope of his employment, was engaged in clearing the upper floor of mill No. 2 of the company. While so engaged he was in the act of dropping a pine block from the upper floor of the mill to the ground below; this being the usual and ordinary way of clearing the floor, and it being the duty of the plaintiff in the course of his employment to so drop it. The block weighed about 75 pounds.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">As appellant was in the act of dropping the block to the ground below, he was on the edge of the upper floor of the mill. As he started to turn the block loose so that it would drop to the ground, he saw J. Greeley McGowin, testator of the defendants, on the ground below and directly under where the block would have fallen had appellant turned it loose. Had he turned it loose it would have struck McGowin with such force as to have caused him serious bodily harm or death. Appellant could have remained safely on the upper floor of the mill by turning the block loose and allowing it to drop, but had he done this the block would have fallen on McGowin and caused him serious injuries or death. The only safe and reasonable way to prevent this was for appellant to hold to the block and divert its direction in falling from the place where McGowin was standing and the only safe way to divert it so as to prevent its coming into contact with McGowin was for appellant to fall with it to the ground below. Appellant did this, and by holding to the block and falling with it to the ground below, he diverted the course of its fall in such way that McGowin was not injured. In thus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page520" class="pagebreak">520</span>preventing the injuries to McGowin appellant himself received serious bodily injuries, resulting in his right leg being broken, the heel of his right foot torn off and his right arm broken. He was badly crippled for life and rendered unable to do physical or mental labor.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">On September 1, 1925, in consideration of appellant having prevented him from sustaining death or serious bodily harm and in consideration of the injuries appellant had received, McGowin agreed with him to care for and maintain him for the remainder of appellant’s life at the rate of $15 every two weeks from the time he sustained his injuries to and during the remainder of appellant’s life; it being agreed that McGowin would pay this sum to appellant for his maintenance. Under the agreement McGowin paid or caused to be paid to appellant the sum so agreed on up until McGowin’s death on January 1, 1934. After his death the payments were continued to and including January 27, 1934, at which time they were discontinued. Thereupon plaintiff brought suit to recover the unpaid installments accruing up to the time of the bringing of the suit.</p>
<p class="indent">The action was for the unpaid installments accruing after January 27, 1934, to the time of the suit.</p>
<p class="indent">The principal grounds of demurrer to the original and amended complaint are: (1) It states no cause of action; (2) its averments show the contract was without consideration; (3) it fails to allege that McGowin had, at or before the services were rendered, agreed to pay appellant for them; (4) the contract declared on is void under the statute of frauds.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. The averments of the complaint show that appellant saved McGowin from death or grievous bodily harm. This was a material benefit to him of infinitely more value than any financial aid he could have received. Receiving this benefit, McGowin became morally bound to compensate appellant for the services rendered. Recognizing his moral obligation, he expressly agreed to pay appellant as alleged in the complaint and complied with this agreement up to the time of his death; a period of more than 8 years.</p>
<p class="indent">Had McGowin been accidentally poisoned and a physician, without his knowledge or request, had administered an antidote, thus saving his life, a subsequent promise by McGowin to pay the physician would have been valid. Likewise, McGowin’s agreement as disclosed by the complaint to compensate appellant for saving him from death or grievous bodily injury is valid and enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">Where the promisee cares for, improves, and preserves the property of the promisor, though done without his request, it is sufficient consideration for the promisor’s subsequent agreement to pay for the service, because of the material benefit received….</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page521" class="pagebreak">521</div>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Boothe v. Fitzpatrick</span>, 36 Vt. 681, the court held that a promise by defendant to pay for the past keeping of a bull which had escaped from defendant’s premises and been cared for by plaintiff was valid, although there was no previous request, because the subsequent promise obviated that objection; it being equivalent to a previous request. On the same principle, had the promisee saved the promisor’s life or his body from grievous harm, his subsequent promise to pay for the services rendered would have been valid. Such service would have been far more material than caring for his bull. Any holding that saving a man from death or grievous bodily harm is not a material benefit sufficient to uphold a subsequent promise to pay for the service, necessarily rests on the assumption that saving life and preservation of the body from harm have only a sentimental value. The converse of this is true. Life and preservation of the body have material, pecuniary values, measurable in dollars and cents. Because of this, physicians practice their profession charging for services rendered in saving life and curing the body of its ills, and surgeons perform operations. The same is true as to the law of negligence, authorizing the assessment of damages in personal injury cases based upon the extent of the injuries, earnings, and life expectancies of those injured.</p>
<p class="indent">In the business of life insurance, the value of a man’s life is measured in dollars and cents according to his expectancy, the soundness of his body, and his ability to pay premiums. The same is true as to health and accident insurance.</p>
<p class="indent">It follows that if, as alleged in the complaint, appellant saved J. Greeley McGowin from death or grievous bodily harm, and McGowin subsequently agreed to pay him for the service rendered, it became a valid and enforceable contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. It is well settled that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support a subsequent promise to pay where the promisor has received a material benefit, although there was no original duty or liability resting on the promisor…. In the case of <span class="italic">State ex rel. Bayer v. Funk</span>, the court held that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support an executory promise where the promisor has received an actual pecuniary or material benefit for which he subsequently expressly promised to pay.</p>
<p class="indent">The case at bar is clearly distinguishable from that class of cases where the consideration is a mere moral obligation or conscientious duty unconnected with receipt by promisor of benefits of a material or pecuniary nature. Here the promisor received a material benefit constituting a valid consideration for his promise.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Some authorities hold that, for a moral obligation to support a subsequent promise to pay, there must have existed a prior legal or equitable obligation, which for some reason had become unenforceable, but for which the promisor was still morally bound. This rule, however, is subject to qualification in those cases where the promisor, having received a material benefit from the promisee, is morally bound <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page522" class="pagebreak">522</span>to compensate him for the services rendered and in consideration of this obligation promises to pay. In such cases the subsequent promise to pay is an affirmance or ratification of the services rendered carrying with it the presumption that a previous request for the service was made….</p>
<p class="indent">Under the decisions above cited, McGowin’s express promise to pay appellant for the services rendered was an affirmance or ratification of what appellant had done raising the presumption that the services had been rendered at McGowin’s request.</p>
<p class="indent">From what has been said, we are of the opinion that the court below erred in the ruling complained of; that is to say, in sustaining the demurrer, and for this error the case is reversed and remanded.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversed and remanded.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>AMFORD</small>, J. (concurring). The questions involved in this case are not free from doubt, and perhaps the strict letter of the rule, as stated by judges, though not always in accord, would bar a recovery by plaintiff, but following the principle announced by Chief Justice Marshall in <span class="italic">Hoffman v. Porter</span>, Fed.Cas. No. 6,577, 2 Brock. 156, 159, where he says, “I do not think that law ought to be separated from justice, where it is at most doubtful,” I concur in the conclusions reached by the court.</p>
<p id="sec238" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. If McGowin’s son Floyd—grateful to Webb for saving his father’s life—had made the promise instead of J. Greeley McGowin himself, would the Alabama court have followed <span class="italic">Mills v. Wyman</span>?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If McGowin during his lifetime, rather than his executor after his death, had refused to carry out the promise and had been sued, would the result have been different?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. If McGowin had promised Webb $500,000 as a reward for his action, would the Alabama court have reached the same result as it did here? Would the $500,000 promise have been “without consideration”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Judge Bricken stated, “It is well settled that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support a subsequent promise to pay where the promisor has received a material benefit, although there was no original duty or liability resting on the promisor.” Can this statement be reconciled with the holding in <span class="italic">Passante v. McWilliam</span>? If the Upper Deck board received a material benefit from Passante’s work to secure funding for the company, isn’t the moral obligation to compensate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page523" class="pagebreak">523</span>Passante for performing that service sufficient to make its subsequent promise to give Passante three percent of the company enforceable?</p>

The Second Restatement § 86 tells us when a promise made in recognition of a past benefit is “binding,” while California Civil Code § 1606 tells us to what extent the moral obligation based on past benefit is “good consideration,” and New York General Obligations Law § 5–1105 says when such promises “shall not be denied effect as a valid contractual obligation” on that ground. What significance, if any, do you attach to these different formulations? Which one do you prefer?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If, as the California Court of Appeal suggests, p. 514, the Upper Deck’s commitment to Passante was an attempt by the board to fulfill “a moral obligation,” why doesn’t California Civil Code § 1606 make the promise to Passante legally enforceable “to an extent corresponding with the extent of the [moral] obligation”?</p>

<p class="indent">Can a promise to perform an act the promisor already is obligated to perform be consideration for another promise? In the abstract, the answer would appear to be no. The promisor is not getting anything for her promise; she would be entitled to the same performance without ever making the promise. But the answer is more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page525" class="pagebreak">525</span>complicated in some situations. Parties to an ongoing or executory contract may need to modify it during the course of performance. If Buyer agrees to permit Seller to increase the price for the goods because costs have risen between the time the contract was made and the date of delivery, what consideration does Seller provide for the modification? Seller has already promised to deliver the goods at the lower price. If Sarah owes Eli $100 on a past due debt, can she enforce a promise by Eli to accept $50 in satisfaction of the debt? What consideration has Eli received for his promise? Does it matter that the debt has been outstanding for years and Eli had long since resigned himself to the probability that it is uncollectable? The answer to questions like this must be flexible enough to permit contracts to be adjusted in the face of unforeseen circumstances and to permit good faith compromise of disputes but not so loose as to encourage extortion and chiseling by unscrupulous contractors.</p>

<p class="sectionb">New York Court of Appeals, 1921.</p>
<p class="sectionb">231 N.Y. 196, 131 N.E. 887.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>RANE</small>, J. On the 31st day of August, 1917, the plaintiff entered into the following employment agreement with the defendant:</p>
<p class="blockquoteds">Bauman–Basch, Inc.<br />Coats &amp; Wraps<br />31–33 East 32d Street<br />New York</p>
<p class="blockquotedis">Agreement entered into this 31st day of August, 1917, by and between Bauman–Basch, Inc., a domestic corporation, party of the first part, and Louis Schwartzreich, of the borough of Bronx, city of New York, party of the second part, witnesseth:</p>
<p class="blockquotedis">The party of the first part does hereby employ the party of the second part, and the party of the second part agrees to enter the services of the party of the first part as a designer of coats and wraps.</p>
<p class="blockquotedis">The employment herein shall commence on the 22d day of November, 1917, and shall continue for twelve months thereafter. The party of the second part shall receive a salary of ninety ($90.00) per week, payable weekly.</p>
<p class="blockquotedis">The party of the second part shall devote his entire time and attention to the business of the party of the first part, and shall use his best energies and endeavors in the furtherance of its business.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page526" class="pagebreak">526</div>
<p class="blockquotedis">In witness whereof, the party of the first part has caused its seal to be affixed hereto and these presents to be signed, and the party of the second part has hereunto set his hand and seal the day and year first above written.</p>
<p class="blockquoteds">Bauman–Basch, Inc.,<br />S. Bauman<br />Louis Schwartzreich.<br />In the presence of.</p>
<p class="indent">In October the plaintiff was offered more money by another concern. Mr. Bauman, an officer of the Bauman–Basch, Inc., says that in that month he heard that the plaintiff was going to leave and thereupon had with him the following conversation:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">A. I called him in the office, and I asked him, “Is that true that you want to leave us?” and he said “Yes,” and I said “Mr. Schwartzreich, how can you do that; you are under contract with us?” He said, “Somebody offered me more money.” * * * I said, “How much do they offer you?” He said, “They offered him $115 a week.” * * * I said, “I cannot get a designer now, and, in view of the fact that I have to send my sample line out on the road, I will give you a hundred dollars a week rather than to let you go.” He said, “If you will give me $100, I will stay.”</p>
<p class="indent">Thereupon Mr. Bauman dictated to his stenographer a new contract, dated October 17, 1917, in the exact words of the first contract and running for the same period, the salary being $100 a week, which contract was duly executed by the parties and witnessed. Duplicate originals were kept by the plaintiff and defendant.</p>
<p class="indent">Simultaneously with the signing of this new contract the plaintiff’s copy of the old contract was either given to or left with Mr. Bauman. He testifies that the plaintiff gave him the paper but that he did not take it from him. The signatures to the old contract plaintiff tore off at the time according to Mr. Bauman.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff’s version as to the execution of the new contract is as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">A. I told Mr. Bauman that I have an offer from Scheer &amp; Mayer of $110 a week, and I said to him: “Do you advise me as a friendly matter—will you advise me as a friendly matter what to do; you see I have a contract with you, and I should not accept the offer of $110 a week, and I ask you, as a matter of friendship, do you advise me to take it or not.” At the minute he did not say anything, but the day afterwards he came to me in and he said “I will give you $100 a week, and I want you to stay with me.’ I said: ‘All right, I will accept it; it is very nice of you that you do that, and I appreciate it very much.’”</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff says that on the 17th of October, when the new contract was signed, he gave his copy of the old contract back to Mr. Bauman, who said: “You do not want this contract any more because the new one takes its place.”</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff remained in the defendant’s employ until the following December, when he was discharged. He brought this action under the contract of October 17th for his damages.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page527" class="pagebreak">527</div>
<p class="indent">The defense, insisted upon through all the courts, is that there was no consideration for the new contract as the plaintiff was already bound under his agreement of August 31, 1917, to do the same work for the same period at $90 a week.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial justice submitted to the jury the question whether there was a cancellation of the old contract and charged as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">If you find that the $90 contract was prior to or at the time of the execution of the $100 contract canceled and revoked by the parties by their mutual consent, then it is your duty to find that there was a consideration for the making of the contract in suit, viz., the $100 contract, and, in that event, the plaintiff would be entitled to your verdict for such damages as you may find resulted proximately, naturally, and necessarily in consequence of the plaintiff’s discharge prior to the termination of the contract period of which I shall speak later on.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant’s counsel thereupon excepted to that portion of the charge in which the court permitted the jury to find that the prior contract may have been canceled simultaneously with the execution of the other agreement. Again the court said:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The test question is whether by word or by act, either prior to or at the time of the signing of the $100 contract, these parties mutually agreed that the old contract from that instant should be null and void.</p>
<p class="indent">The jury having rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, the trial justice set it aside and dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence that the first contract was canceled to warrant the jury’s findings.</p>
<p class="indent">The above quotations from the record show that a question of fact was presented and that the evidence most favorable for the plaintiff would sustain a finding that the first contract was destroyed, canceled, or abrogated by the consent of both parties.</p>
<p class="indent">The Appellate Term was right in reversing this ruling. Instead of granting a new trial, however, it reinstated the verdict of the jury and the judgment for the plaintiff. The question remains, therefore, whether the charge of the court, as above given, was a correct statement of the law or whether on all the evidence in the plaintiff’s favor a cause of action was made out.</p>
<p class="indent">Can a contract of employment be set aside or terminated by the parties to it and a new one made or substituted in its place? If so, is it competent to end the one and make the other at the same time?</p>
<p class="indent">It has been repeatedly held that a promise made to induce a party to do that which he is already bound by contract to perform is without consideration. But the cases in this state, while enforcing this rule, also recognize that a contract may be canceled by mutual consent and a new one made. Thus <span class="italic">Vanderbilt v. Schreyer</span> held that it was no consideration for a guaranty that a party promise to do only that which he was before legally bound to perform. This court stated, however:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page528" class="pagebreak">528</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It would doubtless be competent for parties to cancel an existing contract and make a new one to complete the same work at a different rate of compensation, but it seems that it would be essential to its validity that there should be a valid cancellation of the original contract….</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Cosgray v. New England Piano Co.</span>, it was decided that where the plaintiff had bound himself to work for a year at $30 a week, there was no consideration for a promise thereafter made by the defendant that he should, notwithstanding, receive $1,800 a year. Here it will be noticed there was no termination of the first agreement which gave occasion for Bartlett, J., to say in the opinion: “The case might be different if the parties had, by word of mouth, agreed, wholly to abrogate and do away with a pre-existing written contract in regard to service and compensation, and had substituted for it another agreement.”</p>
<p class="indent">Any change in an existing contract, such as a modification of the rate of compensation, or a supplemental agreement, must have a new consideration to support it. In such a case the contract is continued, not ended. Where, however, an existing contract is terminated by consent of both parties and a new one executed in its place and stead, we have a different situation and the mutual promises are again a consideration. Very little difference may appear in a mere change of compensation in an existing and continuing contract and a termination of one contract and the making of a new one for the same time and work, but at an increased compensation. There is, however, a marked difference in principle. Where the new contract gives any new privilege or advantage to the promis[or], a consideration has been recognized, though in the main it is the same contract.</p>
<p class="indent">If this which we are now holding were not the rule, parties having once made a contract would be prevented from changing it no matter how willing and desirous they might be to do so, unless the terms conferred an additional benefit to the promis[or].</p>
<p class="indent">All concede that an agreement may be rescinded by mutual consent and a new agreement made thereafter on any terms to which the parties may assent. Prof. Williston, in his work on Contracts, says (volume 1, § 130a): “A rescission followed shortly afterwards by a new agreement in regard to the same subject-matter would create the legal obligations provided in the subsequent agreement.”</p>
<p class="indent">The same effect follows in our judgment from a new contract entered into at the same time the old one is destroyed and rescinded by mutual consent. The determining factor is the rescission by consent. Provided this is the expressed and acted upon intention, the time of the rescission, whether a moment before or at the same time as the making of the new contract, is unimportant.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page529" class="pagebreak">529</div>
<p class="indent">The efforts of the courts to give a legal reason for holding good a promise to pay an additional compensation for the fulfillment of a pre-existing contract is commented upon in note upon <span class="italic">Abbott v. Doane</span> and the result reached is stated as follows: “The almost universal rule is that without any express rescission of the old contract the promise is made simply for additional compensation, making the new promise a mere <span class="italic">nudum pactum</span>.”</p>
<p class="indent">As before stated, in this case we have an express rescission and a new contract.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no reason that we can see why the parties to a contract may not come together and agree to cancel and rescind an existing contract, making a new one in its place. We are also of the opinion that reason and authority support the conclusion that both transactions can take place at the same time.</p>
<p class="indent">For the reasons here stated, the charge of the trial court was correct, and the judgments of the Appellate Division and the Appellate Term should be affirmed, with costs.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course it goes without saying that the parties <span class="italic">could</span> have canceled the old contract and subsequently have made a new one. It is equally plain that they observed the <span class="italic">formalities</span> usual in making a contract, that is to say, they performed all the necessary gestures, and gave promise for promise, and made what would have been, except for the rule of law under discussion, the clearest example of a good contract. But were the parties capable, at the time, of making that particular contract? The answer to that question depends upon the answer to the primary question whether, when the second contract was made, the first contract was at an end.</p>
<p class="indent">A true cancellation of a contract leaves the parties to it in <span class="italic">statu quo ante,</span> that is, it leaves them in the same situation, in respect of the subject matter of the canceled contract, as if they had never seen or heard of each other. An agreement to cancel a contract is itself just as truly a contract as the contract it terminates, and its effect is to put an end to the contract, not merely that the contractors may thereby be enabled to enter into another contract with each other, but to leave them in perfect freedom to refuse to enter into any further contractual relationship with each other. Now, it may be theoretically possible for parties to a contract genuinely to terminate it by agreement, thereby intending to be free to refuse to deal with each other again, and then immediately and genuinely to change their minds and remake the contract that was canceled, with a change of terms in favor of one party only. It is more reasonable, however, to assume that at least some few moments must elapse between the time when two given minds shall agree to cancel an existing contract, and the time when those same two minds shall decide to reinstate it, or again make one very like it. In <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page530" class="pagebreak">530</span>the world of realities lightning-fast changes of the kind that must have taken place to make the second contract good do not occur, and I feel quite safe in saying dogmatically that no such sudden revulsion occurred here; nor, indeed, do I understand that such an absurdity is claimed. Can it be seriously urged that the defendant was willing that the plaintiff should have any moment of freedom from the old contract—such freedom, I mean, as to give the plaintiff the right to seek employment from some one other than the defendant? I think it is very clear that the parties never intended to be free from each other, and that the new contract was a mere substitution for the old one, and that is precisely what the rule that refuses validity to a promise to pay more for what the promisee is already obligated to do, was intended to prevent.</p>
<p class="indent">There is nothing in this case that distinguishes it from the many cases in the books in which the ancient rule of law referred to was applied. The tearing up of one writing and the delivery of another writing in its stead are unimportant evidentiary details. Whenever the question of the rule’s applicability has arisen, one contract has been in legal effect destroyed, and another contract, valid but for the rule, has been substituted for it. Quite obviously, the physical tearing of a piece of paper accomplishes nothing more than does an oral agreement to cancel. And I see no importance in the particular chronological order in which the various physical gestures occurred. Indeed, it seems to me that the entire argument of the appellant amounts to nothing more than a mere magnification of the value of immaterial details, and misses the real meaning and purpose of the doctrine we are dealing with. That the courts have shown no disposition to authorize any departure from the rule is shown in a comparatively recent case where it was said: “Thus, the only question presented in this case is whether a new promise by a party to do less than he has already agreed to do is a sufficient consideration for the promise of another party to do more than he is obliged to do. It seems to me that the negative answer to that question is so plain that there is no opportunity for doubt….”</p>
<p id="sec247" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Judges become suspicious when a second agreement requires a party to be paid more to do only what it was already obligated to do. They are hesitant to believe that a party would pay more for what it already had a right to for less. Even when they do not articulate this suspicion, they may adopt a presumption against the party seeking to enforce the agreement. “Prove to the court,” judges seem to say, “that the other party freely and knowingly entered into this agreement. Tell a story that itself gives a good reason for not invoking the pre-existing duty rule.”</p>
<p class="indent">Yet there is likely to be more than one version of what happened. Schwartzreich has his story, and Mr. Bauman has his. Which story, Schwartzreich’s or Bauman–Basch’s, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page531" class="pagebreak">531</span>should the trier of fact have believed? What about the surrounding circumstances leads you to this conclusion? What additional information would you like to have were you the trier of fact?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. The Court of Appeals places a great deal of weight on the largely ceremonial acts of surrendering and tearing the signatures off the old contract. These acts seem significant to the court for both doctrinal and credibility reasons. The court also seems to assume that parties intending to have a second agreement enforced would go through the right steps to announce this fact to the outside world. If the problem here is that Bauman is only consenting to the new agreement under duress, does the fact that Schwartzreich surrendered the old contract and tore off the parties’ signatures necessarily support the conclusion that Bauman–Basch was not coerced? In fact, what else might Schwartzreich have done to make it appear that the parties intended to have the second agreement be enforceable?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. It would appear under the most generous theory of damages that this lawsuit involved less than $1,000. Why did Bauman–Basch fight through jury trial and two levels of appeal? Does this persistence suggest that Bauman–Basch was really mad at Schwartzreich for ripping it off? Should its lawyer have advised it to continue fighting this case when it became clear that the costs of court proceedings would far exceed any possible judgment it might avoid even if ultimately vindicated?</p>

<p id="sec248" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Watkins &amp; Son v. Carrig</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">New Hampshire Supreme Court, 1941.</p>
<p class="sectionb">21 A.2d 591, 91 N.H. 459.</p>
<p class="indent">Assumpsit, for work done. By a written contract between the parties the plaintiff agreed to excavate a cellar for the defendant for a stated price. Soon after the work was commenced solid rock was encountered. The plaintiff’s manager notified the defendant, a meeting between them was held, and it was orally agreed that the plaintiff should remove the rock at a stipulated unit price about nine times greater than the unit price for excavating upon which the gross amount to be paid according to the written contract was calculated. The rock proved to constitute about two-thirds of the space to be excavated.</p>
<p class="indent">A referee found that the oral agreement “superseded” the written contract, and reported a verdict for the plaintiff based on the finding. To the acceptance of the report and an order of judgment thereon the defendant excepted. Further facts appear in the opinion.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page532" class="pagebreak">532</div>
<p class="noindentt">■ A<small>LLEN</small>, C<small>HIEF</small> J<small>USTICE</small>….</p>
<p class="indent">In the situation presented the plaintiff entered into a contractual obligation. Facts subsequently learned showed the obligation to be burdensome and the contract improvident. On insistent request by the plaintiff, the defendant granted relief from the burden by a promise to pay a special price which overcame the burden. The promise was not an assumption of the burden; the special price was fair and the defendant received reasonable value for it.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue whether the grant of relief constituted a valid contract is one of difficulty. The basic rule that a promise without consideration for it is invalid leads to its logical application that a promise to pay for what the promisor already has a right to receive from the promisee is invalid. The promisee’s performance of an existing duty is no detriment to him, and hence nothing is given by him beyond what is already due the promisor. But the claim is here made that the original contract was rescinded, either in full or in respect to some of its terms, by mutual consent, and since any rescission mutually agreed upon is in itself a contract, the claim of a promise to pay for performance of a subsisting duty is unfounded. The terms of the contract of rescission are of course valid if the rescission is valid. The defendant’s answer to this claim is well stated in this quotation from Williston, Contr., 2d Ed., § 130a: “But calling an agreement an agreement for rescission does not do away with the necessity of consideration, and when the agreement for rescission is coupled with a further agreement that the work provided for in the earlier agreement shall be completed and that the other party shall give more than he originally promised, the total effect of the second agreement is that one party promises to do exactly what he had previously bound himself to do, and the other party promises to give an additional compensation therefor.”</p>
<p class="indent">With due respect for this eminent authority, the argument appears to clothe consideration with insistence of control beyond its proper demands. With full recognition of the legal worthlessness of a bare promise and of performance of a subsisting duty as a void consideration, a result accomplished by proper means is not necessarily bad because it would be bad if the means were improper or were not employed.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not perceived that the requirement of consideration is necessarily disregarded in spite of the net result of a promise to pay more for less, without additional obligation of the promisee. If the process in reaching such a result is inoffensive to the doctrine of consideration, the result does not become a naked promise. If in analysis of the transaction compliance with the elements of a valid contract may be found, it is hardly a perversion of principle to give the steps taken recognition. The result being reasonable, the means taken to reach it may be examined to determine their propriety.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page533" class="pagebreak">533</div>
<p class="indent">In common understanding there is, importantly, a wide divergence between a bare promise and a promise in adjustment of a contractual promise already outstanding. A promise with no supporting consideration would upset well and long-established human interrelations if the law did not treat it as a vain thing. But parties to a valid contract generally understand that it is subject to any mutual action they may take in its performance. Changes to meet changes in circumstances and conditions should be valid if the law is to carry out its function and service by rules conformable with reasonable practices and understandings in matters of business and commerce.</p>
<p class="indent">Rescission in full or in modification being intended, it should be effective although the result benefits only one party and places a burden only on the other. It is the fact of rescission rather than the effect of it that determines its legal quality. The difference between a rescission unrelated to a new contract and one interdependent with a new contract, with the result the same in each case, signifies no failure of consideration in the latter case. The result, whatever it may be, is indecisive of the contractual character of the transaction. The steps taken being pointed out by the law, the result should not be held an idle one. Merger of the rescission and promise into one transaction does not destroy them as elements composing the transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">In another analysis of the transaction, more than a naked promise to pay more than the promisor owed appears. The promise was accompanied by the mutual understanding that the terms of the contract were to be modified. The conclusion follows that if the promisor had the right under the contract to have rock excavated at the same price as was to be paid for other material, he surrendered it. Conceding that the plaintiff did no more than the contract called for, yet if it was presented with a discharge from its duty, as an element of the transaction, by application of the law of gifts a completed discharge of a liability was validly effected. The form of statement by which one surrenders a right, if the law does not have special requirements for it, may be in any words showing the act to be one of making a present. The gift here was not of the promise to pay more, but of release of the plaintiff’s duty to work for less. Whether it was, in its character and form, a gift to which the law attaches validity, is to be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that by the weight of authority an oral gift of a chose in action is legally ineffective, in respect to a transfer to one not the debtor. The relation between the creditor and the debtor is personal, and by common law the creditor’s title is not assignable. So far as under equitable doctrines one may assign, as a present, the use and benefit of his intangible rights, a verbal statement of the transfer is ineffective. Williston, Conts., 1st Ed. But when a creditor releases his debtor, without full payment of the debt, no assignment is involved. The debt is extinguished, and if the release is in full or partial measure a present, the present is perfected. If the creditor agrees to take a part of the debt in full payment, and the part is paid, no exception to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page534" class="pagebreak">534</span>the need of consideration is apparent. The completed transaction is of a promise fulfilled. The debt is satisfied, according to the intention of the parties, and it is thought that the law should validate the action. The law has no policy that a creditor may not make voluntary and gratuitous concessions to his debtor. It is the everyday experience of business life, and is consistent with legal principle, and no rule of the law of evidence interposes to require proof of the present by other than oral testimony of it.</p>
<p class="indent">The argument for validity of the release is as strong as in the cases of a promise by a debtor to pay a debt barred by bankruptcy or by the statute of limitations. In such cases, while the cause of action survives, the debtor gives away his right not to be sued upon it, without receiving anything in return for the surrender. The ground upon which the cases are usually put, of a past consideration, or of one implied, is illogical, and in resting upon it they are anomalous. But upon the view of a release presented legal consistency is maintained.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether the gift to a debtor of an intangible right be termed a waiver, a surrender, an abandonment, or a release, seems broadly immaterial. Its nature, in yielding the right, or in forgiving the obligation, is determinative, rather than its appellation. There may be distinctions and discriminations in the required manner of their metaphysical delivery, but here… no symbolism or particular form of evidence is an essential of proof. The case is one of a simple relinquishment of a right pertaining to intangible personalty. The defendant intentionally and voluntarily yielded to a demand for a special price for excavating rock. In doing this he yielded his contract right to the price it provided. Whether or not he thought he had the right, he intended, and executed his intent, to make no claim of the right. The promise of a special price for excavating rock necessarily imported a release or waiver of any right by the contract to hold the plaintiff to the lower price the contract stipulated. In mutual understanding the parties agreed that the contract price was not to control. The contract right being freely surrendered, the issue of contract law whether the new promise is valid is not doubtful. If the totality of the transaction was a promise to pay more for less, there was in its inherent makeup a valid discharge of an obligation. Although the transaction was single, the element of discharge was distinct in precedence of the new promise.</p>
<p class="indent">The foregoing views are considered to meet the reasonable needs of standard and ethical practices of men in their business dealings with each other. Conceding that the plaintiff threatened to break its contract because it found the contract to be improvident, yet the defendant yielded to the threat without protest, excusing the plaintiff, and making a new arrangement. Not insisting on his rights but relinquishing them, fairly he should be held to the new arrangement. The law is a means to the end. It is not the law because it is the law, but because it is adapted and adaptable to establish and maintain reasonable order. If the phrase justice according to law were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page535" class="pagebreak">535</span>transposed into law according to justice, it would perhaps be more accurately expressive. In a case like this, of conflicting rules and authority, a result which is considered better to establish “fundamental justice and reasonableness,” should be attained. It is not practical that the law should adopt all precepts of moral conduct, but it is desirable that its rules and principles should not run counter to them in the important conduct and transactions of life.</p>
<p class="indent">Exceptions overruled.</p>
<p id="sec249" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Chief Justice Allen, unlike Judge Crane in <span class="italic">Schwartzreich</span>, does not demand a ceremonial effort evidencing rescission of the first agreement. Why not? How does the court know that the bargain was not the product of duress?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Carrig’s willingness to pay more for what he has a right to for less is described as a gift whose “appellation” (“a waiver, a surrender, an abandonment, or a release”) is “immaterial.” If Watkins had subsequently refused to perform the <span class="italic">second</span> contract, would the court still have talked “gift” and thus limited Carrig’s damages to those based on that second contract’s higher price?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The court seems to accept that Carrig acceded to Watkins’ threat not to perform according to the terms of the first contract. Did Watkins originally agree to excavate that much rock? If not, did Carrig give up any rights? If so, was the fact that Carrig gave up a right acceptable because he did so without protest at the time? Isn’t Carrig’s unwillingness to pay the second contract’s rate a properly lodged protest? Is it any less appropriate or timely than the protest that is implicit in an assertion of duress?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. If the answer to Question 3 entails inquiry into the fairness of the adjustment made by the parties, can someone in Watkins’ position threaten so long as the adjustment sought is a fair market exchange? How does this decision square with the doctrine of adequacy of consideration? Consider Comment c to Restatement, Second, Contracts § 73:</p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="bold">c</span>. <span class="italic">Contractual Duty to the Promisor</span>. Legal remedies for breach of contract ordinarily involve delay and expense and rarely put the promisee in fully as good a position as voluntary performance. It is therefore often to a promisee’s advantage to offer a bonus to a recalcitrant promisor to induce performance without legal proceedings, and an unscrupulous promisor may threaten breach in order to obtain such a bonus. In extreme cases, a bargain for additional compensation under such circumstances may be voidable for duress…. And the lack of social utility in such bargains provides what modern justification there is for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page536" class="pagebreak">536</span>the rule that performance of a contractual duty is not consideration for a new promise.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">But the rule has not been limited to cases where there was a possibility of unfair pressure, and it has been much criticized as resting on scholastic logic. Slight variations of circumstance are commonly held to take a case out of the rule, particularly where the parties have made an equitable adjustment in the course of performance of a continuing contract….</p>

<p id="sec250" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Autotrol Corp. v. Continental Water Systems Corp.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1990. 918 F.2d 689.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ P<small>OSNER</small>, J. This is a diversity suit, primarily for breach of contract. The suit was tried to a jury, and the plaintiff, Autotrol Corporation, obtained a judgment of more than $1.5 million. The appeal raises a large number of issues, only a handful of which require discussion. So far as the remaining issues are concerned, it is enough to note that the district judge resolved most of them in a thoroughly satisfactory manner and that the others could not possibly have affected the outcome of the trial.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract provides that any dispute under it shall be resolved in accordance with the law of Texas. Neither party questions the validity of this choice-of-law stipulation but it is rather academic because there are no Texas cases on the hotly contested issues.</p>
<p class="indent">The contract, signed in May 1986, established a joint venture between Autotrol’s controls division and Continental Water Systems Corporation to create a system for water purification based on a patented new technology, known as “electrodiarese,” that Continental owned the exclusive right to exploit. Autotrol was to manufacture the control for the system and Continental the rest and both companies would sell the completed systems—Autotrol the large systems, Continental the small ones. There was an ambiguity, later to prove critical, about the dividing line between large and small.</p>
<p class="indent">Before production could begin, there had to be product specifications. These had not been completed when the contract was signed. Anticipating this possibility, the contract provided that when approved by both parties the specifications would be attached to, and thereby made a part of, the contract; and should the parties be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page537" class="pagebreak">537</span>“unable, in good faith, to agree upon the contents of the Products Specifications Schedule by June 30, 1986, either party hereto may elect to terminate this Agreement.” On June 25 the parties agreed to extend this deadline to July 17. July 17 came and went and the product specifications had not been agreed upon but neither party exercised its right of termination. It was almost a year later, with the product specifications still not having been agreed upon, that Continental declared the contract terminated. That is the alleged breach. Meanwhile the other defendant, Olin Corporation, had acquired all the stock of Continental, and according to evidence that the jury reasonably could credit had decided that unless Autotrol acceded to the defendants’ understanding of what the smallest system was that Autotrol was entitled to sell—which Autotrol refused to do—Autotrol would be encroaching on the segment of the market that Olin wanted to reserve for Continental.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants argue that they were free to terminate the contract at any time after July 17, for any reason or no reason, without liability, provided only that the product specifications had not been finally agreed upon and attached to the contract as a schedule. Yet Continental encouraged Autotrol to continue working, which meant continue spending, on Autotrol’s share of the project for many months after July 17—indeed, right up to the notice of termination—even though the product specifications had not been agreed upon. Autotrol does not argue that this encouragement was sufficiently promissory in form to support liability under a theory of promissory estoppel, on which see Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 89(c) and comment d (1981). But it does argue that, in conjunction with Autotrol’s parallel forbearance to exercise its right of termination, Continental’s encouragement supports an inference that the parties had modified the contract to waive Continental’s right to terminate after July 17 for failure to agree on product specifications. This is assuming Continental had such a right, which Autotrol denies, thus giving it two grounds upon which to argue that there was a breach of contract. The jury found a breach but was not asked to indicate the ground, so we must affirm if either ground is supportable; as a matter of fact both are.</p>
<p class="indent">Under either of Autotrol’s theories, once July 17 came and went Continental could not terminate the contract without liability—ever—even if the parties never did work out product specifications. At first acquaintance the argument is implausible. The parties could not go into production without such specifications. If they reached impasse after bargaining in good faith, would not either party be entitled to walk away from the contract without liability? Apparently not. The contract is deliberately asymmetrical with respect to termination after July 17 (June 30 in the original contract, before the date was extended). Until then either party can walk if the product specifications have not been agreed upon. After that Autotrol can walk until production commences but “Continental shall have no right to terminate this Agreement except as provided in” certain paragraphs of the contract that relate to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page538" class="pagebreak">538</span>specific (and immaterial) changed circumstances, such as bankruptcy, but not to failure to work out product specifications. Not only by encouraging Autotrol to continue working after July 17, but in the contract itself, Continental seems to have surrendered the right it would otherwise have had to terminate the contract upon the failure of an essential condition.</p>
<p class="indent">What sense can this make? The answer lies in the asymmetry of the parties’ position. Continental controlled the patent on electrodiarese and if it abandoned the project, say by failing to agree on product specifications, Autotrol would be unable to go forward and would lose its investment. But if Autotrol abandoned the project Continental could always get another partner. Making the contract terminable by Autotrol but not by Continental gave Autotrol leverage to force Continental to license the patent to Autotrol on reasonable terms if Continental lost interest in the project.</p>
<p class="indent">If all this is wrong and Continental somehow retained an implicit right to terminate the contract without liability, even after July 17, provided that the parties were unable to agree upon product specifications, still the jury was entitled to find that the parties had modified the contract to forbid termination on this ground at least until such time as the need to agree on product specifications was urgent and agreement impossible. That deadline had not been reached when the defendants terminated—on a ground, moreover, that had nothing to do with product specifications, but rather with the division of the market for the product. The modification was supported by consideration; both parties benefited from relaxing the deadline, inasmuch as this allowed the project to proceed. Though oral, and somewhat vague about the duration of Continental’s commitment, the modification was sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and an oral modification is enforceable under Texas law even if the contract forbids oral modifications, as this one did. The Texas approach is, by no means, idiosyncratic. For in most of the cases in which oral modifications are enforced in the face of prohibitory language in the contract the party seeking enforcement has relied on the modification; and an invitation to rely, here inferable from both statements and conduct of Continental, is the sort of waiver of a clause forbidding oral modifications that would be honored even under the Uniform Commercial Code, which makes such clauses expressly enforceable in contracts for the sale of goods.</p>

<p class="indent">An ancient application of the pre-existing duty rule provides that a promise to pay a lesser amount is not consideration to discharge a greater outstanding debt. The rule announcing this result is often referred to as the doctrine of <span class="italic">Foakes v. Beer</span>, L.R. 9 A.C. 605 (1884), although its antecedents can be traced back to Lord Coke’s dictum in <span class="italic">Pinnel’s Case</span>, 77 Eng. Rep. 237 (C.P.1602). While seemingly far-reaching, the rule can be successfully invoked only if the debt is liquidated, undisputed, and matured, and even then can be escaped if the debtor’s promise to pay the lesser sum is accompanied by any minor change in the terms of payment constituting a detriment to the debtor or by something more or different—the modern equivalent of Lord Coke’s metaphorical suggestion that a “horse, hawk or robe” might in such cases be sufficient additional consideration. Indeed modifications of debts that reduce the principal owing are a commonplace in the commercial world. The fact that this rule has been so deliberately gutted undoubtedly reflects an uneasiness with the “logically compelled” results of the requirement of consideration in cases of claims settlement.</p>

<p class="list_alpha">(1) Forbearance to assert or the surrender of a claim or defense which proves to be invalid is not consideration unless</p>
<p class="list_alpha1">(a) the claim or defense is in fact doubtful because of uncertainty as to the facts or the law, or</p>

<p class="list_alphap">C<small>OMMENTS</small>:</p>
<p class="list_alpha2"><span class="italic">b. Requirement of Good Faith.</span> The policy favoring compromise of disputed claims is clearest, perhaps, where a claim is surrendered at a time when it is uncertain whether it is valid or not. Even though the invalidity later becomes clear, the bargain is to be judged as it appeared to the parties at the time; if the claim was then doubtful, no inquiry is necessary as to their good faith. Even though the invalidity should have been clear at the time, the settlement of an honest dispute is upheld. But a mere assertion or denial of liability does not make a claim doubtful, and the fact that invalidity is obvious may indicate that it was known. In such cases Subsection (1)(b) requires a showing of good faith.</p>
<p class="list_alpha2"><span class="italic">c. Unliquidated Obligations.</span> An undisputed obligation may be unliquidated, that is uncertain or disputed in amount. The settlement of such a claim is governed by the same principles as settlement of a claim the existence of which is doubtful or disputed. The payment of any definite sum of money on account of a single claim which is entirely unliquidated is consideration for a return promise. An admission by the obligor that a minimum amount is due does not liquidate the claim even partially unless he is contractually bound to the admission. But payment of less than is admittedly due may in some circumstances tend to show that a partial defense or offset was not asserted in good faith.</p>
<p class="list_alpha2">Payment of an obligation which is liquidated and undisputed is not consideration for a promise to surrender an unliquidated claim which is wholly distinct…. Whether in a particular case there is a single unliquidated claim or a combination of separate claims, some liquidated and some not, depends <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page543" class="pagebreak">543</span>on the circumstances and the agreements of the parties. If there are no circumstances of unfair pressure or economic coercion and a disputed item is closely related to an undisputed item, the two are treated as making up a single unliquidated claim; and payment of the amount admittedly due can be consideration for a promise to surrender the entire claim.</p>

<p id="sec259" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON ACCORDS</span></p>
<p class="indent">When parties substitute a new contract for one previously made, the old contract is dead. But a full substitution may be unfair unless the new deal is performed. When one party compromises her advantage under the old contract to avoid a threatened breach, she will be stuck with a reduced claim without obtaining the bargained-for benefit of avoiding the burdens of suit. To solve this problem, the law has long provided a device labeled an <span class="italic">accord</span> that attempts to provide the best of two worlds: protection of the new deal as dominant over the old one, with retention of the old deal until the new deal is performed. This device can be used not only in situations where breach is threatened before performance is due, but also in cases where breach has occurred and a settlement agreement is made. In the process of providing such a device, the law—as might be expected—created a variety of new (and largely unnecessary) problems.</p>

<p class="list_alpha">(2) Until performance of the accord, the original duty is suspended unless there is such a breach of the accord by the obligor as discharges the new duty of the obligee to accept the performance in satisfaction.

<p class="list_alpha2"><span class="italic">a. Nature of an Accord.</span> An accord is a contract under which an obligee promises to accept a substituted performance in future satisfaction of the obligor’s duty. Because an accord is a contract, it differs from a mere revocable offer by the obligee to accept a substituted performance in satisfaction of the duty…. The typical accord involves an exchange of promises (Illustration 1), although an accord may also take the form of an option contract. It is the essence of an accord that the original duty is not satisfied until the accord is performed, a result that is sometimes suggested by use of the term “executory accord.” See Comment <span class="italic">e.</span></p>
<p class="list_alpha2"><span class="italic">b</span>. <span class="italic">Suspensory Effect.</span> The accord entitles the obligor to a chance to render the substituted performance in satisfaction of the original duty. Under the rule stated in Subsection (2), the obligee’s right to enforce that duty is suspended subject to the terms of the accord until the obligor has had that chance. If the obligor is under a duty to perform the accord, his performance discharges both his original duty and his duty under the accord…. If, however, there is such a breach of the accord by the obligor as discharges the obligee’s duty under the accord to accept the stated performance in satisfaction, he is no longer bound by the accord. He may then choose between enforcement of the original duty and any duty under the accord….</p>

B, after reading the letter, indorses the check and deposits it in his bank for collection. B is bound by an accord under which he promises to accept payment of the check as satisfaction of A’s debt for repairs. The result is the same if, before indorsing the check, B adds the words “Accepted under protest as part payment.” The result would be different, however, if B’s claim were liquidated, undisputed and matured.

In resolving doubts in this regard, a court is less likely to conclude that an obligee was willing to accept a mere promise in satisfaction of an original duty that was clear than in satisfaction of one that was doubtful. It is therefore less likely to find a substituted contract and more likely to find an accord if the original duty was one to pay money, if it was undisputed, if it was liquidated and if it was matured.</p>

<p class="sectionb">Nevada Supreme Court, 1970.</p>
<p class="sectionb">86 Nev. 593, 472 P.2d 335</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>OWBRAY</small>, J. This is a contract case arising from the sale of a 160–acre parcel of real property in Lyon County. The dispute centers about three wells located on the property.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">1. T<small>HE</small> F<small>ACTS</small>.</span></p>
<p class="indent">In February 1967, Clarence Johnson and his wife, Glodean, who are the appellants, agreed to sell their property to Joe and Ann M. Utile, who are the respondents. The parties signed a “Deposit Receipt and Agreement of Sale,” which provided in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“* * * Seller agrees to drill 16 inch well, same area, same depth as existing irrigation well. Well to be tested, minimum 24 hours, at between 1,000 and 1,200 GPM (gallons per minute). Seller agrees to drill and test well on or before close of escrow.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page547" class="pagebreak">547</div>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In 1 month to the day, on March 3, 1967, the parties signed their escrow instructions, which provided in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">“(6) Sellers herein to drill and test a new well prior to close of escrow. Well to be 16 inches and in the same area and at the same depth as the existing well.”</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately 1 month later, the Johnsons orally informed the Utiles that the existing well on the property, which had been drilled and used for some time (and which we shall designate as Well No. 1), was no longer operative and that, therefore, it was not to be considered included in the sale of the premises. The Utiles then consulted their attorney and resolved the matter by having him write the Johnsons a letter dated May 12, 1967, which provided in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">“* * * (Y)our suggestion to leave your test pump and a gasoline-powered motor on the new well (Well No. 2) for and in consideration of the Utiles relinquishing any claim on the existing well (Well No. 1) would be satisfactory, provided that the equipment is in satisfactory operating condition, and, further, assuming that the new well has been tested and is capable of producing the amount of gallonage set out in the agreements referred to herein, and, of course that the pump and motor are capable of pumping the water in the desired amounts consistent with the gallonage rating of the well itself. * * *”</p>
<p class="indent">This arrangement appeared to satisfy the parties, and Mr. Johnson, who is a licensed well driller, proceeded to drill Well No 2. He drilled the well to a depth of 105 feet and testified that it produced, over a 24–hour period, from 1,000 to 1,200 gallons of water per minute. The Utiles took possession of the property in June. They claim that the well never produced more than 300 gallons of water per minute and that in September 1967 the well went dry. Thereafter, the Utiles drilled a third well (Well No. 3), which apparently is operative and satisfactory for all ostensible purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Utiles then commenced this action in the district court, seeking damages for (1) the loss of Well No. 1, (2) expenses incurred in attempting to repair Well No. 2 and for drilling Well No. 3, (3) seed loss due to water shortage, and (4) attorney’s fees and costs. The district judge found in favor of the Utiles and awarded them damages as follows: (1) $3,200 for the loss of Well No. 1; (2) $419.15 for expenses incurred in attempting to make Well No. 2 operative; (3) $3,060 for the cost of Well No. 3; (4) $636 for seed loss; and (5) $1,500 for attorney’s fees and costs. We affirm the judgment of the lower court and the damages awarded therein.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">2. T<small>HE</small> C<small>OMPROMISE</small> A<small>GREEMENT</small>.</span></p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">A. Executory accord or substituted contract.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The principal issue in this case will be resolved by our interpretation of counsel’s letter to the Johnsons of May 12, 1967; i.e.: Was the proposed compromise agreement, which the Johnsons accepted, an executory accord or a substituted contract?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page548" class="pagebreak">548</div>
<p class="indent">A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties, in an effort to resolve their differences over a claim, agree to an amicable settlement based upon mutual concessions. Compromise agreements are usually divided into two principal categories: One may be called an ‘executory accord’; the other may be called a ‘substituted contract.’ If the compromise provides for the acceptance in the future of a stated performance in satisfaction of the claim, the contract is an ‘executory accord.’ If, on the other hand, the compromise agreement itself is accepted as a substitution for and extinguishment of the existing claim, then the compromise is a substituted contract. Or, to state it another way, an agreement that operates as a satisfaction of an antecedent claim only when performed is an executory accord, and an agreement that operates as an immediate substitution for and extinguishment of an antecedent claim is a substituted contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The distinction becomes vital in relation to the remedies available to the nonbreaching party if and when the compromise agreement is broken. If an executory accord is breached, the nonbreaching party may sue either upon the original obligation or upon the compromise agreement. As stated in Restatement of Contracts s 417(c) (1932):</p>
<p class="indent">“If the debtor breaks such a contract the creditor has alternative rights. He can enforce either the original duty or the subsequent contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">This is the prevailing view throughout the American jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">B. The Intent.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The determination of whether the compromise agreement is an executory accord or a substituted contract turns on the intent of the parties to it. As stated by Corbin, supra, § 1293, at 190:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It is frequently difficult to determine whether a new agreement is a substituted contract operating as an immediate discharge, or is an accord executory, the performance of which it is agreed shall operate as a future discharge. It is wholly a question of intention to be determined by the usual processes of interpretation, implication or construction.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the record shows that counsel’s letter of May 12 and the Johnsons’ acceptance by their subsequent conduct constituted an executory accord. Admittedly, the language of the Deposit Receipt and Agreement of Sale and the escrow instructions lacks clarity. Because of the ambiguity in the written documents, the district judge heard and considered the oral testimony of the parties, and he concluded as a result thereof that their initial agreement included not only an operating well (Well No. 1), but also the drilling of Well No. 2. A fair reading of counsel’s May 12 letter supports the court’s conclusion that the letter referred to an antecedent obligation, where the proposed compromise stated that the Utiles agreed to relinquish their claim to operating Well No. 1, ‘provided that the equipment (on Well <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page549" class="pagebreak">549</span>No. 1) is in satisfactory operating condition, and, further, assuming that the new well (Well No. 2) has been tested and is capable of producing the amount of gallonage set out in the agreements * * *’ (Emphasis added.) Such language supports the district judge’s decision, in that the Utiles agreed to relinquish their right to Well No. 1 only after Well No. 2 had been drilled and had produced and operated satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">C. The Breach.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Utiles may recover damages for the loss of Well No. 1 only if the record supports the district judge’s finding that the Johnsons breached the parties’ compromise agreement by failing to produce Well No. 2, in that it was not “capable of producing the amount of gallonage set out in the agreements * * *”</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants argue on this point that their only duty with respect to Well No. 2 was to produce a well on the property that would test between 1,000 and 1,200 gallons of water per minute. Mr. Johnson testified that he conducted such a test, with satisfactory results. The Utiles, however, produced evidence that the well production never exceeded 300 gallons per minute and that in a comparatively short period of time it went dry. While there is a conflict in the record, there is sufficient evidence to support the district judge’s finding that the parties bargained for something more than a mere test and truly intended that the well to be drilled, Well No. 2, should be capable of producing the specified gallonage over a reasonable period of time, if the well were to be of any value to the purchasers. This court may not disturb the finding of the lower court where there is evidence in the record to support it.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">3. T<small>HE</small> D<small>AMAGES</small>.</span></p>
<p class="indent">This court has reiterated on several occasions the well recognized rule that one who breaches a duty to another is liable for all damages naturally flowing from the wrongful breach.</p>
<p class="indent">Since we have ruled in the instant case that the compromise agreement of the parties was an executory accord, which was breached by the appellants, it follows that the plaintiffs-respondents were entitled to damages for the loss of Well No. 1, their expenses incurred in attempting to make Well No. 2 operative, the drilling of Well No. 3 to replace Well No. 2, and their seed loss due to lack of water, as well as their attorney’s fees and costs. The record supports the damages awarded by the district judge, and we may not disturb the award on appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p class="sectionb">403 F.3d 869.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ C<small>UDAHY</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff IFC Credit Corporation (IFC) brought suit alleging that Bulk Petroleum Corporation (Bulk) and its CEO, Darshan Dhaliwal, breached a lease agreement under which Bulk leased gasoline tanks and other equipment from IFC with an option to purchase them at the end of the lease. Bulk claims that the lease agreement has been concluded through an accord and satisfaction executed with the assignee of IFC’s rights under the lease. The district court, through Magistrate Judge Aaron E. Goodstein, granted Bulk’s motion for summary judgment, ruling that a valid accord and satisfaction had taken place. IFC now appeals that ruling, and we affirm.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. F<small>ACTUAL</small> B<small>ACKGROUND AND</small> D<small>ISPOSITION</small> B<small>ELOW</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">On or about June 21, 1995, Bulk and IFC entered into a series of agreements by which Bulk leased gasoline tanks and equipment from IFC to be used at various gas stations operated by Bulk. Under the terms of the agreements, Bulk was given an option to purchase the equipment at the end of the 72-month lease term. The purchase price was to be the greater of the fair market value of the equipment and $31,419.40, together with all applicable taxes. The lease documents also provided for extension of the lease term at a rate of $2,820.52 per month. The documents further required that any notices regarding the purchase of the equipment were to be sent to IFC at a designated address. Concurrent with the execution of the lease, Bulk’s CEO, Darshan Dhaliwal, executed a personal guaranty of the agreements.</p>
<p class="indent">Less than two weeks later, on or about June 30, 1995, the Bulk lease was assigned by IFC to Finova Capital Corporation (Finova), giving Finova full right, title and interest in the lease, including the initial scheduled payments under the lease. Bulk’s payments were to be sent to a Finova lockbox.</p>
<p class="indent">Beginning in November 2000, IFC’s Patrick Witowski and Bulk’s John Gerth engaged in negotiations concerning the termination of the lease and purchase of the equipment by Bulk. However, the two parties could not agree on a purchase price. On January 23, 2001, while these negotiations were ongoing, Finova notified Bulk in writing that all further negotiations regarding the purchase option were to be conducted with IFC (and with Witowski specifically). Finova then promptly filed for bankruptcy on March 7, 2001.</p>
<p class="indent">On June 18, 2001, Dhaliwal, who to that point had apparently not been involved in negotiations, sent a letter to Finova and a check for $31,419.40, made out to Finova Capital Corporation. The invoice attached to the check read “pay off lease 5613500,” and the endorsement area on the back of the check stated “payment in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page551" class="pagebreak">551</span>full of lease and purchase option # 5613500.” The accompanying letter from Dhaliwal stated that the check represented “payment in full of the lease and the purchase option” and that “[a]cceptance of this check represents full satisfaction of the obligation of Bulk Petroleum to Finova Capital Corporation.” The letter concluded by stating that if Finova did not accept the check, then it should inform Bulk as to where it should ship the leased equipment back to Finova.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties dispute the exact date upon which IFC, via Witowski, received a copy of Dhaliwal’s letter. They also dispute whether the letter and the check were sent together or separately, and whether the check was sent to Finova’s “automated lockbox” rather than to its office (though the letter does not appear to have been sent to a P.O. Box address). In any event, it is undisputed that Witowski (and hence IFC) received a copy of the letter and the check via fax from Bulk on June 22, 2001. The check was negotiated three days later by Finova on June 25, 2001. Following negotiation of the check, IFC did not return the tendered money or claim that Finova had negotiated the check in error. Instead, IFC retained the tendered money, claiming that it constituted only partial satisfaction of Bulk’s outstanding obligations under the agreement (which IFC reckoned to be in excess of $200,000). Bulk refused to make further payments, contending that its contractual obligations under the lease had been fulfilled upon acceptance and negotiation of the $31,419.40 check to Finova.</p>
<p class="indent">IFC filed this action on December 15, 2002, seeking to recover $207,961.88 (plus holdover rent) that it claims is owed by Bulk due to the breach of the lease agreement. IFC also sued Dahliwal based upon the personal guaranty he executed contemporaneously with the lease. On October 22, 2003, Bulk and Dahliwal filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that IFC’s claim was barred by a valid accord and satisfaction. The district court granted Bulk and Dahliwal’s motion, ruling that there was no remaining question of fact that defendants had met all the requirements of an accord and satisfaction under the relevant Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provisions and Illinois law, and there was no evidence that the check was tendered in bad faith. (Apr. 5, 2004 Order.) IFC’s appeal now comes before this Court. Since Bulk’s tender met all the requirements of a valid accord and satisfaction, and above all since IFC did not return the tendered money or attempt to “undo” the transaction, we affirm.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III. D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Under both Illinois law and the relevant provisions of the UCC, an accord and satisfaction occurs when the “person against whom a claim is asserted proves that (i) that person in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute, and (iii) the claimant obtained payment of the instrument.” [UCC § 3-311(a)]. <span class="italic">Accord Saichek v. Lupa</span> (“An accord and satisfaction is a contractual method <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page552" class="pagebreak">552</span>of discharging a debt or claim. To constitute an accord and satisfaction there must be: (1) a bona fide dispute, (2) an unliquidated sum, (3) consideration, (4) a shared and mutual intent to compromise the claim, and (5) execution of the agreement.”). Additionally, [UCC § 3-311(b)] requires that “the instrument or an accompanying written communication contain[ ] a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.”</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly Bulk’s tendered check and accompanying letter facially meet these criteria. The purchase price of the tanks was subject to a “bona fide dispute” (the parties could not agree on a price), the instrument and accompanying letter sent by Bulk contained highly “conspicuous statement[s]” that the check was tendered as full satisfaction of all obligations under the lease and purchase agreement, and Finova “obtained payment of the instrument” by negotiating the check on June 25, 2001. So far so good.</p>
<p class="indent">Paragraph (c) of section 3-311 adds a slight twist. It provides for an exception to these basic requirements which is designed to avoid inadvertent satisfaction of debts when a tender is sent to a large company. Under section (c), an otherwise valid tender to a claimant “organization” fails if “(i) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a <span class="italic">designated person, office, or place,</span> and (ii) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received by that designated person, office, or place.” 3-311(c) (emphasis added). This exception does not apply, however, if “within a <span class="italic">reasonable time before collection of the instrument</span> was initiated, the claimant or an agent of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.” 3-311(d) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case, assuming that IFC and Finova qualify as “organizations” so as to trigger the provisions of paragraph (c), Witowski was the acknowledged “designated person” responsible for conducting communications regarding the lease/purchase agreement, and Bulk sent the disputed check to Finova rather than to IFC or Witowski directly. Had no further communications taken place, this circumstance could have thwarted any attempted accord and satisfaction under section 3-311(c). However, it is undisputed that Witowski eventually received notice of Bulk’s tender no later than June 22, 2001 three days before the check was cashed by Finova. The transaction here thus falls squarely within the provisions of section 3-311(d): regardless of any initial misdirection in making the tender, notice was given to the correct party within a reasonable time before collection of the instrument. The special exception contained in paragraph (c) does not apply, and Finova’s negotiation of the check presumptively suffices to conclude a valid accord and satisfaction.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page553" class="pagebreak">553</div>
<p class="indent">IFC objects that there is a material question of fact as to whether Bulk tendered its check in good faith. The UCC comment provides that “good faith” implies “not only honesty in fact, but the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. The meaning of ‘fair dealing’ will depend upon the facts in the particular case.” U.C.C. § 3-311, cmt. ¶ 4 (2002). Here, IFC alleges that Bulk’s failure to send the check directly to Witowski and its mailing of the check and explanatory letter separately, taken together, indicate that Bulk was surreptitiously attempting to induce IFC into an inadvertent accord and satisfaction. On this score we note first that the parties hotly contest whether the letter and check were sent separately or together, and in any case IFC has waived this particular argument since it did not advance it below.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, IFC’s allegations, even if credited, are probably not sufficient to obviate the tender in any event. Ordinarily the good faith requirement is violated where there is no bona fide mutual dispute concerning consideration, or the party tendering the payment affirmatively misleads the claimant. <span class="italic">See McMahon Food Corp. v. Burger Dairy Co.</span> (holding there was no good faith where debtor induces acceptance of payment by falsely leading creditor’s agent to believe that creditor agreed to the terms of the payment). Here, by contrast, there was no misrepresentation or proactive deception; Bulk merely sent the check to the wrong party. Additionally, Bulk quickly notified Witowski of the tender verbally and via fax thereafter.</p>
<p class="indent">But in any event, IFC continues to retain the money sent to it by Bulk. This bare fact trumps any concerns we might have about the procedural specifics of the transaction itself. On the basis of this consideration alone IFC’s claims must fail. Illinois courts have long held that, where there is a bona fide dispute as to the amount due, retention of a tender conspicuously identified as an accord and satisfaction effectively dooms a claimant’s case. An Illinois appellate court has recently applied this principle to a case analogous to the one at bar. In <span class="italic">Bankers Leasing Association, Inc. v. Pranno,</span> the debtor sent the creditor a check conspicuously marked as being in full satisfaction of all outstanding debts and accompanied by a letter to the same effect. The creditor, with full knowledge of the dispute as to the amount of the debt, promptly cashed the check and, just as IFC/Finova has done in this case, attempted to characterize the transaction as only partial satisfaction of outstanding debts. The court rejected this argument, however, holding that a valid accord and satisfaction had occurred:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">When Pranno [the creditor] cashed the check, however, he knew there was a dispute. He knew the parties did not agree on what amount Bankers owed him …. Pranno may have tried to hedge what he was agreeing to by stating in an affidavit that the check satisfied only part of the dispute, but “If there is a bona fide dispute as to the amount due, it makes no difference that the creditor protests <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page554" class="pagebreak">554</span>that he does not accept the amount in full satisfaction. The creditor must either accept the payment with the condition or refuse.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Both the check and letter Bankers sent Pranno clearly indicated that by cashing the check, Pranno agreed that all claims between Bankers and Pranno would be satisfied. If Pranno did not agree to these terms, he should not have cashed the check.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Pranno,</span> 224 Ill.Dec. 46, 681 N.E.2d at 34. IFC attempts to distinguish <span class="italic">Pranno</span> by pointing out that there the tendered check and the explanatory letter arrived together, while in this case they were (allegedly) sent separately. Once again, IFC has waived any argument to this effect, and in any case such a minor factual quibble is irrelevant to the principle articulated here. The recipient of a conspicuously-marked tender proposing an accord and satisfaction may not keep the tender and simultaneously contend that no accord and satisfaction occurred.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">IV. C<small>ONCLUSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">In light of the foregoing, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants Bulk Petroleum and Darshan Dhaliwal.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">The creation of the “accord” and its “satisfaction” are often discussed as if they occurred simultaneously. Accord and satisfaction are, however, independent (even if overlapping) events and are not necessarily simultaneous. For example, until the drawer’s bank honors a check, there may be a period where there is an accord executory but not yet a satisfaction. In fact, what appears to be an accord executory may well be nothing more than an offer of an option contract, i.e., a creditor’s offer which can be “accepted” only by delivery of the stated substitute performance by the debtor. Following this analysis the accord is, of course, no bar to an action by the offeror until it “is performed.” Yet it does not necessarily follow that the offer can in every case be revoked before performance; arguments along the lines of Restatement, Second, Contracts §§ 45 and 90 may operate to limit the offeror’s power of revocation.</p>
<p class="indent">If the arrangement between creditor and debtor is said to be a contract based on an exchange of promises, then either of two possible interpretations follow. The first is that new contract substitutes for the old obligation. The new agreement, in other words, will then be a satisfaction in itself. If this is the case, of course it can be pleaded by the debtor “in bar” to a suit by the creditor on the original obligation, an obligation that has been extinguished by the substituted agreement. What is more, even if the debtor does not perform this new agreement, the creditor will only be able to hold him on the new agreement; the old agreement will have been fully discharged.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page555" class="pagebreak">555</div>
<p class="indent">Another possible interpretation, however, is that an accord has been formed which preserves the creditor’s ability to sue on the original obligation if the debtor defaults on the new agreement. This is accomplished by finding that the new agreement consists of a promise by the debtor to perform a new obligation in return for the creditor’s conditional promise to release the debtor from the old obligation if—and only if—the new obligation is performed. Under this view, there is no bar to the creditor’s action on the old obligation <span class="italic">if the debtor defaults</span> on the new one because the old one is not extinguished until the new one is performed. The creditor can then pick either the old obligation or the broken new agreement as the basis for his suit.</p>
<p class="indent">Why all this ado about whether a debtor may use a valid “accord executory” as a “bar” to a creditor’s suit in breach of that accord? All of the cases admit that the debtor can maintain an action for damages on the breached accord. If this is the case, doesn’t a counterclaim by the debtor in the creditor’s wrongful suit fully protect the debtor? Won’t the damages on such a counterclaim put the debtor in as good a position, practically speaking, as if the accord were accepted “in bar”?</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">The most common form of action taken in reliance on a promise is the furnishing of consideration. In reliance on seller’s promise to deliver the goods, buyer pays the purchase price. This is bargained for action in reliance. The payment is consideration, binding the seller to the promise to deliver the goods. The first thing for you to learn about action in reliance, therefore, is that it usually is bargained-for and therefore is not different from consideration and need not be treated as a distinct subject of analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the promisor does not explicitly request the other party to perform an action or make a return promise as the price of the promise, but nonetheless the promisee may rely on the promise by taking a variety of actions it otherwise would not take. The promisee may take substantial action in preparation of its own performance. It may commit resources and materials and expend large amounts of time and effort toward that performance. In most commercial situations this action in reliance is anticipated by both sides, and it is not hard to find that the promisee’s performance of these actions is part of the exchange. Recall <span class="italic">Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff–Gordon</span>, p. 40, or <span class="italic">Sylvan Crest Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States</span>, p. 36. There are situations, however, in which it is not so clear that the action or forbearance taken in reliance on the promise was requested as part of a bargained-for exchange. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page556" class="pagebreak">556</span>This may suggest that the action was gratuitous (a gift) and not consideration. Recall <span class="italic">Baehr v. Penn–O–Tex Oil Corp.</span>, p. 486. Moreover, as we move away from business transactions to other contexts, such as family transactions, charitable subscriptions and the like, the intention of the promisor to bargain for the action in reliance becomes less clear. Recall Williston’s tramp, p. 475. It may become strained in such situations to talk about the other party’s action in reliance as “bargained-for.”</p>
<p class="indent">A small, but distinct, body of doctrine has grown up to explain how unbargained-for action in reliance can make a promise enforceable. The conceptual handle that judges grabbed to explain this result is “estoppel.” This term historically described an evidentiary concept that precluded a party who has led another to rely on the existence of a particular state of facts from then denying the truth of those facts. The idea is that you cannot make representations that lead the other side to believe something is true and to rely to its detriment on that belief, and then change your story and assert that that same thing is not true. Having induced reliance, the party is precluded from denying that the facts are as it has led the other side to believe. Using the term estoppel allows the court to avoid calling the party who switches stories a liar or a fraud by instead focusing on the preclusive effect of the other side’s reliance. The term “promissory estoppel” is a label for the application of the estoppel idea to promises as opposed to facts. The classic statement of this concept is found in Section 90 of the Restatement, Second, Contracts.</p>

<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 90. Promise Reasonably Inducing Action or Forbearance.</span></h4>
<p class="list_alpha">(1) A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Section 90’s assumption that reliance on unperformed promises can result in unfairness and injustice is heavily dependent on the reasonableness of the action in reliance. In many common situations, the same facts that would support a conclusion that the reliance was reasonable also would support the inference that it was requested and, therefore, bargained-for. When unbargained-for action in reliance is claimed to be the basis for enforcing a promise, it often is reasonable for the court to find, as a matter of fact, that there was an implicit bargain arising out of the context of the parties’ dealings.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page557" class="pagebreak">557</div>
<p class="indent">As a result, many, if not most, cases decided under Section 90 could have been analyzed by the court in traditional consideration terms. Note how many of the cases that follow could have been dealt with by treating the reliance as consideration, simply by interpreting the promisor as impliedly requesting the acts of reliance by the promisee.</p>

<p id="sec265" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Ricketts v. Scothorn</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Nebraska Supreme Court, 1898.</p>
<p class="sectionb">57 Neb. 51, 77 N.W. 365.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ S<small>ULLIVAN</small>, J. In the district court of Lancaster county the plaintiff, Katie Scothorn, recovered judgment against the defendant, Andrew D. Ricketts, as executor of the last will and testament of John C. Ricketts, deceased. The action was based upon a promissory note, of which the following is a copy: “May the first, 1891. I promise to pay to Katie Scothorn on demand, $2,000, to be at 6 per cent. per annum. J.C. Ricketts.” In the petition the plaintiff alleges that the consideration for the execution of the note was that she should surrender her employment as bookkeeper for Mayer Bros., and cease to work for a living. She also alleges that the note was given to induce her to abandon her occupation, and that, relying on it, and on the annual interest, as a means of support, she gave up the employment in which she was then engaged. These allegations of the petition are denied by the administrator. The material facts are undisputed. They are as follows: John C. Ricketts, the maker of the note, was the grandfather of the plaintiff. Early in May—presumably on the day the note bears date—he called on her at the store where she was working. What transpired between them is thus described by Mr. Flodene, one of the plaintiff’s witnesses:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">A. Well, the old gentleman came in there one morning about nine o’clock, probably a little before or a little after, but early in the morning, and he unbuttoned his vest, and took out a piece of paper in the shape of a note; that is the way it looked to me; and he says to Miss Scothorn, ‘I have fixed out something that you have not got to work anymore.’ He says, ‘none of my grandchildren work, and you don’t have to.’</p>
<p class="blockquotes">Q. Where was she?</p>
<p class="blockquotes">A. She took the piece of paper and kissed him, and kissed the old gentleman, and commenced to cry.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems Miss Scothorn immediately notified her employer of her intention to quit work, and that she did soon after abandon her occupation. The mother of the plaintiff was a witness, and testified that she had a conversation with her father, Mr. Ricketts, shortly after the note was executed, in which he informed her that he had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page558" class="pagebreak">558</span>given the note to the plaintiff to enable her to quit work; that none of his grandchildren worked, and he did not think she ought to. For something more than a year the plaintiff was without an occupation, but in September, 1892, with the consent of her grandfather, and by his assistance, she secured a position as bookkeeper with Messrs. Funke &amp; Ogden. On June 8, 1894, Mr. Ricketts died. He had paid one year’s interest on the note, and a short time before his death expressed regret that he had not been able to pay the balance. In the summer or fall of 1892 he stated to his daughter, Mrs. Scothorn, that if he could sell his farm in Ohio he would pay the note out of the proceeds. He at no time repudiated the obligation.</p>
<p class="indent">We quite agree with counsel for the defendant that upon this evidence there was nothing to submit to the jury, and that a verdict should have been directed peremptorily for one of the parties. The testimony of Flodene and Mrs. Scothorn, taken together, conclusively establishes the fact that the note was not given in consideration of the plaintiff pursuing, or agreeing to pursue, any particular line of conduct. There was no promise on the part of the plaintiff to do, or refrain from doing anything. Her right to the money promised in the note was not made to depend upon an abandonment of her employment with Mayer Bros., and future abstention from like service. Mr. Ricketts made no condition, requirement, or request. He exacted no quid pro quo. He gave the note as a gratuity, and looked for nothing in return. So far as the evidence discloses, it was his purpose to place the plaintiff in a position of independence, where she could work or remain idle, as she might choose. The abandonment of Miss Scothorn of her position as bookkeeper was altogether voluntary. It was not an act done in fulfillment of any contract obligation assumed when she accepted the note.</p>
<p class="indent">The instrument in suit, being given without any valuable consideration, was nothing more than a promise to make a gift in the future of the sum of money therein named. Ordinarily, such promises are not enforceable, even when put in the form of a promissory note. But it has often been held that an action on a note given to a church, college, or other like institution, upon the faith of which money has been expended or obligations incurred, could not be successfully defended on the ground of a want of consideration. In this class of cases the note in suit is nearly always spoken of as a gift or donation, but the decision is generally put on the ground that the expenditure of money or assumption of liability by the donee on the faith of the promise constitutes a valuable and sufficient consideration. It seems to us that the true reason is the preclusion of the defendant, under the doctrine of estoppel, to deny the consideration. Such seems to be the view of the matter taken by the supreme court of Iowa in the case of <span class="italic">Simpson Centenary College v. Tuttle</span>, 71 Iowa 596, where Rothrock, J., speaking for the court, said:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Where a note, however, is based on a promise to give for the support of the objects referred to, it may still be open to this defense [want of consideration], <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page559" class="pagebreak">559</span>unless it shall appear that the donee has, prior to any revocation, entered into engagements, or made expenditures based on such promise, so that he must suffer loss or injury if the note is not paid. This is based on the equitable principle that, after allowing the donee to incur obligations on the faith that the note would be paid, the donor would be estopped from pleading want of consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">And in the case of <span class="italic">Reimensnyder v. Gans</span>, 110 Pa.St. 17, which was an action on a note given as a donation to a charitable object, the court said: “The fact is that, as we may see from the case of <span class="italic">Ryerss v. Trustees</span>, 33 Pa.St. 114, a contract of the kind here involved is enforceable rather by way of estoppel than on the ground of consideration in the original undertaking.” It has been held that a note given in expectation of the payee performing certain services, but without any contract binding him to serve, will not support an action. But when the payee changes his position to his disadvantage in reliance on the promise, a right of action does arise.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the circumstances of this case, is there an equitable estoppel which ought to preclude the defendant from alleging that the note in controversy is lacking in one of the essential elements of a valid contract? We think there is. An estoppel in pais is defined to be “a right arising from acts, admissions, or conduct which have induced a change of position in accordance with the real or apparent intention of the party against whom they are alleged.” Mr. Pomeroy has formulated the following definition:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Equitable estoppel is the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might, perhaps, have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract, or of remedy, as against another person who in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse, and who on his part acquires some corresponding right, either of property, of contract, or of remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">2 Pom.Eq.Jur. 804. According to the undisputed proof, as shown by the record before us, the plaintiff was a working girl, holding a position in which she earned a salary of $10 per week. Her grandfather, desiring to put her in a position of independence, gave her the note, accompanying it with the remark that his other grandchildren did not work, and that she would not be obliged to work any longer. In effect, he suggested that she might abandon her employment, and rely in the future upon the bounty which he promised. He doubtless desired that she should give up her occupation, but, whether he did or not, it is entirely certain that he contemplated such action on her part as a reasonable and probable consequence of his gift. Having intentionally influenced the plaintiff to alter her position for the worse on the faith of the note being paid when due, it would be grossly inequitable to permit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page560" class="pagebreak">560</span>the maker, or his executor, to resist payment on the ground that the promise was given without consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">The petition charges the elements of an equitable estoppel, and the evidence conclusively establishes them. If errors intervened at the trial, they could not have been prejudicial. A verdict for the defendant would be unwarranted. The judgment is right and is affirmed.</p>

<p id="sec267" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON CHARITABLE SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p class="indent">One classic form of gratuitous promise is the charitable pledge. Recognizing a strong public policy in favor of the enforcement of such promises and more generally in the support of private charity, courts have strained mightily to find either consideration or unbargained-for reliance in these situations in order to enforce such gift promises against the reneging donor, or more commonly, her estate.</p>
<p class="indent">“Consideration” has been found in the form of the subscriptions of others which are often tenuously said to have been induced by the reneging donor’s promise or in the agreement of the charity to memorialize the donor’s name. <span class="italic">Allegheny College v. National Chautauqua County Bank of Jamestown</span>, 246 N.Y. 369 (1927) (Cardozo, C.J.). Other courts, apparently reluctant to find a bargain where so obviously a gift is intended, seize on promissory estoppel as a basis for enforcement. In many situations, a charitable beneficiary does make commitments to third parties in the expectation that pledges it has received will be honored, and these cases fit comfortably within the doctrine of promissory estoppel. But in other situations it may be hard to see that the charity or its other donors changed position in any meaningful way on account of the reneging donor’s pledge.</p>
<p class="indent">The Restatement, Second, Contracts § 90(2) simply treats charitable subscriptions as <span class="italic">sui generis</span> and provides for their enforcement without regard to reliance, bargained-for or not: “A charitable subscription … is binding … without proof that the promise induced action or forbearance.” Some jurisdictions have adopted the more forthright Restatement position; others cling to the older approach of purporting to find consideration or reliance where there is little or none; and a few continue to deny enforcement of the pledge when they cannot find substantial detrimental reliance by the disappointed charity.</p>

<p id="sec268" class="noindent">■ L<small>EARNED</small> H<small>AND</small>, J., in <span class="italic">James Baird Co. v. Gimbel Bros.</span>, 64 F.2d 344, 346 (2d Cir. 1933):</p>
<p class="indent">But the plaintiff says that even though no bilateral contract was made, the defendant should be held under the doctrine of “promissory estoppel.” This is to be chiefly found in those cases where persons subscribe to a venture, usually charitable, and are held to their promises after it has been completed. It has been applied much more broadly, however, and has now been generalized in section 90, of the Restatement of Contracts. We may arguendo accept it as it there reads, for it does not apply to the case at bar [in which general contractor Baird claimed that merchant Gimbel Bros. had breached a contract to furnish linoleum]. Offers are ordinarily made in exchange for a consideration, either a counter-promise or some other act which the promisor wishes to secure. In such cases they propose bargains; they presuppose that each promise or performance is an inducement to the other. But a man may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page562" class="pagebreak">562</span>make a promise without expecting an equivalent; a donative promise, conditional or absolute. The common law provided for such by sealed instruments, and it is unfortunate that these are no longer generally available. The doctrine of “promissory estoppel” is to avoid the harsh results of allowing the promisor in such a case to repudiate, when the promisee has acted in reliance upon the promise. But an offer for an exchange is not meant to become a promise until a consideration has been received, either a counter-promise or whatever else is stipulated. To extend it would be to hold the offeror regardless of the stipulated condition of his offer. In the case at bar the defendant offered to deliver the linoleum in exchange for the plaintiff’s acceptance…. That offer could become a promise to deliver only when the equivalent was received; that is, when the plaintiff promised to take and pay for it. There is no room in such a situation for the doctrine of “promissory estoppel.”</p>

<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, 1968.</p>
<p class="sectionb">395 F.2d 388.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ L<small>AY</small>, J. Clausen &amp; Sons brings a suit in two counts against Theo. Hamm Brewing Co. Count I relates to a treble damage action based upon the Sherman Act §§ 1 and 2 and the Clayton Act §§ 2 and 3. Count II, with which we are concerned here, relates to an alleged breach of contract. Hamm sought a summary judgment dismissal of both counts under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The trial court overruled defendant’s motion as to the antitrust claim but sustained its motion as to Count II….</p>
<p class="indent">We reverse and remand to the district court with directions to reinstate Count</p>
<p class="noindent">II.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff alleges that it had been a wholesale distributor of defendant’s products since 1911. Clausen states that in 1950 an oral contract was made with Hamm to become an exclusive Hamm’s beer distributor for an area defined as Southern Minneapolis and contiguous suburbs. In reliance upon said contract Clausen alleges (1) they discontinued all competitors’ products; (2) purchased and maintained inventories, sales, advertising, warehouse space, personnel and facilities as a Hamm’s exclusive distributor; (3) that Clausen was to remain the exclusive distributor as long as Clausen performed its undertaking. It is alleged that in April 1963 Hamm terminated its oral agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court sustained Hamm’s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the contract pleaded was terminable at will since on its face there existed a “lack of mutuality of obligation.”</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page563" class="pagebreak">563</div>
<p class="indent">We need not repeat in detail our concern of summary dismissal under Rule 56. If there exists the slightest doubt as to a factual dispute or “genuine issue of fact” summary judgment should be denied.</p>
<p class="indent">Hamm does not dispute this rule but nevertheless urges that under the pleadings and Minnesota law there exists no doubt that it is entitled to a summary judgment. We disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">“Mutuality of obligation” is only a semantical exercise surrounding the real determinant of a contract, namely, consideration. The Minnesota Supreme Court has acknowledged this:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Defendant contends that there is such a lack of mutuality that the contract is unenforceable. * * *</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Use of the term “mutuality” often leads to confusion in that the word may have several meanings in dealing with contracts. As used here, the essence of defendant’s argument is that, inasmuch as defendant could not demand that plaintiff deliver any quantity of material or recover damages if he failed to do so under exhibit 1, it must follow that the contract is unenforceable. The rule relied upon by defendant is often stated in the axiom that the promise of both parties is binding or neither is binding.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“What the argument really amounts to is that the contract is lacking in consideration.” (Emphasis ours.) Noreen v. Park Construction Co., 255 Minn. 187 (1959).</p>
<p class="indent">See also <span class="italic">Reichert v. Pure Oil Co.</span>, 164 Minn. 252 (1925), discussing mutuality of obligation (consideration) as opposed to mutuality of remedy (a prerequisite for specific performance).</p>
<p class="indent">But Hamm argues under the facts pleaded that consideration is totally lacking and cannot possibly be proved under the facts alleged. Analysis disputes this.</p>
<p class="indent">First, Minnesota has long recognized the principle that consideration may be a detriment incurred, and that it is <span class="italic">not</span> required that consideration pass from the promisee to the promisor to be valid. The court in <span class="italic">Home Supply Co. v. Ostrom</span>, 204 N.W. at 647, stated:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Even though no consideration passed to the plaintiff at the time of its agreement and waiver of the lien right, yet Lindahl’s reliance and action on such waiver should be treated as sufficient consideration. There is a consideration if the promisee, being induced by the agreement, does anything legal which he is not bound to do or refrains from doing anything which he has a right to do—it is sufficient that something valuable flows from him, or that he suffers some prejudice or inconvenience, and that the agreement is the inducement to the transaction.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page564" class="pagebreak">564</div>
<p class="indent">Thus, Clausen’s theory that it <span class="italic">was</span> obligated to invest substantially in Hamm’s advertising, products, sales personnel, buildings, etc. was not considered by the lower court in his opinion….</p>
<p class="indent">Secondly, it may be that the trial court upon proof will find sufficient evidence to justify contractual liability by way of promissory estoppel. Under this theory liability may ensue even if the detriment incurred by one party is not bargained for, if it can be shown that the promisor should reasonably have expected its promise to induce another’s detrimental action.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the indefiniteness of the duration of Clausen’s alleged obligations, the lower court found the contract to be terminable at will.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_110" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-110" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> Even assuming the evidence would show an unqualified unilateral right by Clausen to terminate this would not necessarily deprive the agreement of its essential consideration. Minnesota has long recognized the principle that where a contract is supported by valuable consideration (such as a detriment incurred in exchange for a promise, as in the instant case), then a right of one party to terminate it at will does not render it invalid for lack of mutuality….</p>
<p class="indent">Thus we feel that under Minnesota law where an exclusive franchise dealer under an implied contract, terminable on notice, has at the instance of a manufacturer or supplier invested his resources and credit in establishment of a costly distribution facility for the supplier’s product, and the supplier thereafter unreasonably terminates the contract and dealership without giving the dealer an opportunity to recoup his investment, a claim may be stated. Hamm in effect argues that even if the court can find consideration, plaintiff cannot prove any causal damages. But this is not our concern now. The fact that a plaintiff may have assumed an almost insurmountable burden to prove his alleged claim is a problem often faced by many pleaders. Yet the law must recognize the right to try.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate Count II for a plenary trial.</p>

<p id="sec271" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Garwood Packaging v. Allen &amp; Co.</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 2004.</p>
<p class="sectionb">378 F.3d 698.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ P<small>OSNER</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a diversity suit, governed by Indiana law, in which substantial damages are sought on the basis of promissory estoppel. The suit pits Garwood Packaging, Inc., which created a packaging system designed to increase the shelf life of fresh meat, and its two principals, Garwood and McNamara, against Allen &amp; Company (an investment company) and a vice-president of Allen named Martin. We shall refer to the plaintiffs collectively as “GPI” and the defendants collectively as “Allen.” The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Allen and dismissed the suit.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">GPI had flopped in marketing its food-packaging system and by 1993 had run up debts of $3 million and was broke. It engaged Martin to help find investors. After an initial search turned up nothing, Martin told GPI that Allen (Martin’s employer, remember) would consider investing $2 million of its own money in GPI if another investor could be found who would make a comparable investment. The presence of the other investor would reduce the risk to Allen not only by augmenting GPI’s assets but also by validating Allen’s judgment that GPI might be salvageable, because it would show that someone else was also willing to bet a substantial sum of money on GPI’s salvation. To further reduce its risk Allen decided to off-load half its projected $2 million investment on other investors.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin located a company named Hobart Corporation that was prepared to manufacture $2 million worth of GPI packaging machines in return for equity in the company. Negotiations with Hobart proved arduous, however. There were two sticking points: the amount of equity that Hobart would receive and the obtaining of releases from GPI’s creditors. Hobart may have been concerned that unless the creditors released GPI the company would fail and Hobart wouldn’t be able to sell the packaging systems that it manufactured. Or it may have feared that the creditors would assert liens in the systems. All that is clear is that Hobart insisted on releases. They were also important to the other investors whom Allen wanted to bring into the deal, the ones who would contribute half of Allen’s offered $2 million.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page566" class="pagebreak">566</div>
<p class="indent">Martin told Garwood and McNamara (GPI’s principals) that he would see that the deal went through “come hell or high water.” Eventually, however, Allen decided not to invest, the deal collapsed, and GPI was forced to declare bankruptcy. The reason for Allen’s change of heart was that the investors who it thought had agreed to put up half of “Allen’s” $2 million had gotten cold feet. When Allen withdrew from the deal, no contract had been signed and no agreement had been reached on how much stock either Allen or Hobart would receive in exchange for their contributions to GPI. Nor had releases been obtained from the creditors.</p>
<p class="indent">GPI’s principal claim on appeal, and the only one we need to discuss (the others fall with it), is that Martin’s unequivocal promise to see the deal through to completion bound Allen by the doctrine of promissory estoppel, which makes a promise that induces reasonable reliance legally enforceable. <span class="italic">Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> § 90(1) (1981); 1 E. Allan Farnsworth, <span class="italic">Farnsworth on Contracts</span> § 2.19 (3d ed.2004). If noncontractual promises were never enforced, reliance on their being enforceable would never be reasonable, so let us consider why the law might want to allow people to rely on promises that do not create actual contracts and whether the answer can help GPI.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest answer to the “why” question is that the doctrine merely allows reliance to be substituted for consideration as the basis for making a promise enforceable. On this view promissory estoppel is really just a doctrine of contract law. The most persuasive reason for the requirement of consideration in the law of contracts is that in a system in which oral contracts are enforceable—and by juries, to boot—the requirement provides some evidence that there really <span class="italic">was</span> a promise that was intended to be relied on as a real commitment. Lon L. Fuller, “Consideration and Form,” 41 <span class="italic">Colum. L.Rev.</span> 799, 799-801 (1941). Actual reliance, in the sense of a costly change of position that cannot be recouped if the reliance turns out to have been misplaced, is substitute evidence that there may well have been such a promise. The inference is especially plausible in a commercial setting, because most businesspeople would be reluctant to incur costs in reliance on a promise that they believed the promisor didn’t consider himself legally bound to perform.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, reasonable reliance is seen as nearly as good a reason for thinking there really was a promise as bargained-for reliance is. In many such cases, it is true, no promise was intended, or intended to be legally enforceable; in those cases the application of the doctrine penalizes the defendant for inducing the plaintiff to incur costs of reliance. The penalty is withheld if the reliance was unreasonable; for then the plaintiff’s wound was self-inflicted—he should have known better than to rely.</p>
<p class="indent">A relevant though puzzling difference between breach of contract and promissory estoppel as grounds for legal relief is that while the promise relied on to trigger an estoppel must be definite in the sense of being clearly a promise and not just a statement of intentions, its terms need not be as clear as a contractual promise would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page567" class="pagebreak">567</span>have to be in order to be enforceable. Indiana may go furthest in this direction: “Even though there were insufficient terms for the enforcement of an express oral contract, and unfulfilled pre-existing conditions prohibiting recovery for breach of a written contract …, we are not precluded from finding a promise under these circumstances. Indeed, it is precisely under such circumstances, where a promise is made but which is not enforceable as a ‘contract,’ that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is recognized.” <span class="italic">First National Bank of Logansport v. Logan Mfg. Co</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason for this difference between breach of contract and promissory estoppel is unclear. A stab at an explanation is found in <span class="italic">Rosnick v. Dinsmore</span> (Neb. 1990), where the court said that “promissory estoppel only provides for damages as justice requires and does not attempt to provide the plaintiff damages based upon the benefit of the bargain. The usual measure of damages under a theory of promissory estoppel is the loss incurred by the promisee in reasonable reliance on the promise, or ‘reliance damages.’ Reliance damages are relatively easy to determine, whereas the determination of ‘expectation’ or ‘benefit of the bargain’ damages available in a contract action requires more detailed proof of the terms of the contract.” The only problem with this explanation is that its premise is mistaken; if the promise giving rise to an estoppel is clear, the plaintiff will usually be awarded its value, which would be the equivalent of the expectation measure of damages in an ordinary breach of contract case. <span class="italic">Restatement, supra,</span> § 90 comment d. The rationale in both cases is that the benefit of the contract to the promisee is a good proxy for the opportunities that he forewent in making the contract. L.L. Fuller &amp; William R. Perdue, Jr., “The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages 1,” 46 <span class="italic">Yale L.J.</span> 52, 60 (1936) (“physicians with an extensive practice often charge their patients the full office call fee for broken appointments. Such a charge looks on the face of things like a claim to the promised fee; it seems to be based on the ‘expectation interest.’ Yet the physician making the charge will quite justifiably regard it as compensation for the loss of the opportunity to gain a similar fee from a different patient”). Of course, if the promise is unclear, damages will be limited to expenses incurred in reasonable reliance on the vague promise, <span class="italic">First National Bank of Logansport v. Logan Mfg. Co.,</span> but that would be equally true in a breach of contract case in which the promise that the defendant had broken was unclear.</p>
<p class="indent">But even though the court is “not precluded from finding a promise” by its vagueness, the vaguer the alleged promise the less likely it is to be found to <span class="italic">be</span> a promise. <span class="italic">Restatement</span> § 33(3) and comment <span class="italic">f</span>. And if it is <span class="italic">really</span> vague, the promisee would be imprudent to rely on it—he wouldn’t know whether reliance was worthwhile. The broader principle, which the requirement that the promise be definite and at least minimally clear instantiates, is that the promisee’s reliance must be reasonable; if it is not, then not only is he the gratuitous author of his own disappointment, but probably there wasn’t really a promise, or at least a promise <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page568" class="pagebreak">568</span>intended or likely to induce reliance. The “promise” would have been in the nature of a hope or possibly a prediction rather than a commitment to do something within the “promisor’s” power to do (“I promise it will rain tomorrow”); and the “promisee” would, if sensible, understand this. He would rely or not as he chose but he would know that he would have to bear the cost of any disappointment.</p>
<p class="indent">We note, returning to the facts of this case, that there was costly reliance by GPI, which forewent other opportunities for salvation, and by Garwood and McNamara, who moved from Indiana to Ohio to be near Hobart’s plant where they expected their food-packaging system to be manufactured, and who forgave their personal loans to GPI and incurred other costs as well. The reliance was on statements by Martin, of which “come hell or high water” was the high water mark but is by no means an isolated example. If GPI’s evidence is credited, as it must be in the procedural posture of the case, Martin repeatedly confirmed to GPI that the deal would go through, that Allen’s commitment to invest $2 million was unconditional, that the funding would be forthcoming, and so on; and these statements induced the plaintiffs to incur costs they would otherwise not have done.</p>
<p class="indent">But were these real promises, and likely to be understood as such? Those are two different questions. A person may say something that he intends as merely a prediction, or as a signal of his hopes or intentions, but that is reasonably understood as a promise, and if so, as we know (this is the penal or deterrent function of promissory estoppel), he is bound. But what is a reasonable, and indeed actual, understanding will often depend on the knowledge that the promisee brings to the table. McNamara, with whom Martin primarily dealt, is a former investment banker, not a rube. He knew that in putting together a deal to salvage a failing company there is many a slip ‘twixt cup and lips. Unless blinded by optimism or desperation he <span class="italic">had</span> to know that Martin could not mean <span class="italic">literally</span> that the deal would go through “come hell or high water,” since if Satan or a tsunami obliterated Ohio that would kill the deal. Even if Allen had dug into its pockets for the full $2 million after the investors who it had hoped would put up half the amount defected, the deal might well not have gone through because of Hobart’s demands and because of the creditors. GPI acknowledges that the Internal Revenue Service, one of its largest creditors, wouldn’t give a release until paid in full. Some of GPI’s other creditors also intended to fight rather than to accept a pittance in exchange for a release. Nothing is more common than for a deal to rescue a failing company to fall apart because all the creditors’ consent to the deal cannot be obtained—that is one of the reasons for bankruptcy law. Again these were things of which McNamara was perfectly aware.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem, thus, is not that Martin’s promises were indefinite, which they were not if GPI’s evidence is credited, but that they could not have been reasonably understood by the persons to whom they were addressed (mainly McNamara, the financial partner in GPI) to <span class="italic">be</span> promises rather than expressions of optimism and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page569" class="pagebreak">569</span>determination. To move to Ohio, to forgive personal loans, to forgo other searches for possible investors, and so forth were in the nature of gambles on the part of GPI and its principals. They may have been reasonable gambles, in the sense that the prospects for a successful salvage operation were good enough that taking immediate, even if irrevocable, steps to facilitate and take advantage of the expected happy outcome was prudent. But we often reasonably rely on things that are not promises. A farmer plants his crops in the spring in reasonable reliance that spring will be followed by summer rather than by winter. There can be reasonable reliance on statements as well as on the regularities of nature, but if the statements are not reasonably understood as legally enforceable promises there can be no action for promissory estoppel.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose McNamara thought that there was a 50 percent chance that the deal would go through and believed that reliance on that prospect would cost him $100,000, but also believed that by relying he could expect either to increase the likelihood that the deal would go through or to make more money if it did by being able to start production sooner and that in either event the expected benefit of reliance would exceed $100,000. Then his reliance would be reasonable even if not induced by enforceable promises. The numbers are arbitrary but the example apt. GPI and its principals relied, and may have relied reasonably, but they didn’t rely on Martin’s “promises” because those were not promises reasonably understood as such by so financially sophisticated a businessman as McNarama. So we see now that the essence of the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not that the plaintiff have reasonably relied on the defendant’s promise, but that he have reasonably relied on its <span class="italic">being</span> a promise in the sense of a legal commitment, and not a mere prediction or aspiration or bit of puffery.</p>
<p class="indent">One last point. Ordinarily the question whether a plaintiff reasonably understood a statement to be a promise is a question of fact and so cannot be resolved in summary judgment proceedings. But if it is clear that the question can be answered in only one way, there is no occasion to submit the question to a jury. This, we believe, is such a case.</p>
<p class="indent">AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p id="sec272" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON SECTION 90—HANDLE WITH CARE</span></p>
<p class="indent">Two things must be kept in mind when dealing with unbargained-for reliance upon promises. The first is that the unbargained-for reliance doctrine bears down more heavily on the adequacy notion than does the consideration doctrine. The law may not question the adequacy of consideration but it must (by definition) question the adequacy of reliance. The second is that the measure of recovery available to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page570" class="pagebreak">570</span>injured party in order to avoid injustice is often more properly measured by the cost of the reliance than by the value of the unperformed promise.</p>
<p class="indent">That different legal consequences will flow depending on whether the consideration (bargained-for reliance) label or the unrequested reliance label is attached to a promise makes the distinction between the two categories more than just an interesting intellectual exercise. Section 90 recognizes promises that are relied upon as enforceable, but different in major respects from promises that are truly bargainedfor. It furnishes the law of contract with a way to protect an innocent party against loss suffered because of her understandable reliance on what is essentially a gift promise without overcompensating her by converting a gift into a bargain.</p>
<p class="bordercah-top" />
<h3 id="sec273" class="section"><span class="bold">VII.    F<small>ORM AND</small> E<small>NFORCEABILITY</small></span></h3>
<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">The complexity of the doctrine of consideration is an objection to using it as the basic mark of the enforceable contract. The doctrine does not always permit a person to look at an agreement and readily declare with confidence whether it is an enforceable contract. Contract law would be much less confusing if there were a clear and simple method to determine whether a promise is binding.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to tell whether a promise merits reliance by others and enforcement by the law is to look at the seriousness with which it is made. If the promisor takes special steps to indicate that he considers his obligation to be serious, we are more ready to make him keep it. On the other hand, we are not always impressed with the importance (or the fairness) of enforcing a chance or casual statement that the parties didn’t seem to treat as important when made.</p>
<p class="indent">Intuitively, the <span class="italic">form</span> of the promise is a significant indication of its seriousness and thus its enforceability. As Professor Ames wrote in <span class="italic">Law and Morals</span>, 22 H<small>ARV</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 97, 101 (1908):</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">I asked [my twelve year old son] one day about his plans for the afternoon, and he told me he was to play tennis with his friend John. In the evening, when asked if he had had a good afternoon with John, he said, “Oh, I haven’t been with him. I thought I would rather play with Willie.” “But didn’t John expect you?” “Yes, I suppose he did.” “Was it quite right, after you had led him to expect you, to disappoint him?” “Oh, but I didn’t promise him that I would come.”</p>
<p class="indent">At the twelve-year-old level, adding “cross my heart” or “scout’s honor” is apt to convert an off-hand statement into a binding promise enforceable in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page571" class="pagebreak">571</span>twelve-year-old’s court. Various similar formalities have been common in a broad range of adult societies down to the present time. One is the oath: the promise for which divine sanction and enforcement are invoked. Another is the promise marked by a tangible gift, pledge or ceremonial act. The token exchange, such as the gift of a golden ring in our marriage ceremony, has been used at various times throughout the world to mark the solemn promise. Shaking hands or having a drink together is another common ceremony to bind promisor to promisee. Sometimes a formula of words is used, as in Roman law. The pledge of a valuable possession as security for a promise is a formality that has provided one root for our modern doctrine of consideration; it can be found both in the simple legal systems of primitive tribes and in medieval Frankish law. Most of us still carry around with us some belief in the efficacy of such formalities. Imagine how you feel when the other person breaks her word after you had shaken hands on the deal. But by and large, modern American law claims to be free of formalities.</p>
<p class="indent">Consideration itself can come to resemble a formality, particularly when it is most stubbornly insisted that the law will not question the adequacy of consideration. When one dollar is recited to be the consideration given in exchange for a six-month option to purchase a large office building or some other very valuable right, the “exchange” is a ceremony, not a bargain.</p>
<p class="indent">Formalities may serve a variety of useful functions, including “evidentiary,” “cautionary,” and “channeling” functions. Most forms provide reliable evidence that the transaction occurred and that an agreement was made. These evidentiary tracks may be the writing indicating the content of the agreement, the testimony of the required witness before whom it was made, or the promisee’s possession of the formal token (the ring, the cup). We have already suggested a second “cautionary” function of formality: it is likely to require that the promisor go to some trouble to perform it, and in doing so there is an opportunity for reflection and caution.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, by creating a formality, the law tells the person who wants to be sure that she receives an enforceable promise how to ensure that result. Contract behavior is channeled in directions set by the formality. If the law would prefer written promises, a rule that unwritten promises are not enforceable will lead people to behave in the desired way.</p>
<h4 id="sec274" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">A.   T<small>HE</small> S<small>EAL</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">In medieval times, when few could write their names, documents were commonly authenticated by affixing the wax impression of a seal to important papers. In the beginning, seals were reserved for royalty and very important personages. The impression of the seal on the paper was a sure sign that a powerful person had agreed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page572" class="pagebreak">572</span>to it and had gone to the trouble of melting the wax to show that he meant it. The sealed document was of itself treated as unimpeachable proof of the act by the law for centuries. In those times, a seal “imported its own consideration,” that is, no independent consideration requirement applied to promises made under seal.</p>
<p class="indent">As seals became more and more common, scrawls or pre-printed marks were accepted as seals, and the seal’s importance declined. About half of the American states have abolished all legal significance of the seal by statute beginning a century ago. In a few states, a document is still recognized as enforceable merely because it bears a seal. In others, the statute of limitations is longer for a document under seal. But in such major commercial states as California, Illinois, New York, Ohio, and Texas, statutes have abolished practically all distinctions between sealed and unsealed documents. This means that a document is not enforceable because it is under seal if it is not enforceable without the seal. UCC § 2-203 has similarly rendered seals of no effect in connection with contracts for the sale of goods in all the states.</p>
<h4 id="sec275" class="secsub1"><span class="bold">B.   F<small>ORMAL</small> W<small>RITING AS A</small> B<small>ASIS FOR</small> E<small>NFORCEABILITY</small></span></h4>
<p class="indent">In the eighteenth century, the common law flirted with the idea that all written promises ought to be enforceable, but this was soon rejected and since then the law has clung to the general attitude that written promises (at least those not under seal) are no more deserving of legal enforcement than oral promises. To a degree this offends commonly held attitudes that the writing is more important than the oral conversation. Certainly, the carefully written out agreement often marks the seriously considered, solemnly assumed obligation most deserving of the law’s sanction. Moreover, there are situations in which lawyers for all parties would, for sound reasons, like a promise to be enforceable even though it doesn’t meet common law standards. In such a situation, it would be very convenient to have some formality like the seal or the writing available to make the agreement legally binding. To fill this “unfortunate gap” in the law, the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1925 proposed the Uniform Written Obligations Act:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A written release or promise, hereafter made and signed by the person releasing or promising, shall not be invalid or unenforceable for lack of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page573" class="pagebreak">573</span>consideration, if the writing also contains an additional express statement, in any form of language, that the signer intends to be legally bound.</p>
<p class="noindent">This innovation was received with a staggering lack of enthusiasm. Only Pennsylvania (in 1927) and Utah (in 1929) ever adopted it, and Utah repealed it four years later.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the lack of success of the Uniform Written Obligations Act, a number of statutes more or less along the same lines—though much more limited—have been adopted. A strong argument in favor of developing a simple formality, such as the writing, is that it would clarify the enforceability of promises to make donative transfers (mostly gifts within a family or other intimate association) and substantially reduce the significance of the doctrine of consideration in these marginal areas.</p>
<p class="indent">Drafters have been using a comparable device for a long time. They seek to obviate issues of consideration by reciting the payment of a nominal sum as consideration in the contract. The sums recited are virtually never actually paid. We will return to a special case giving effect to the false recital of nominal consideration in <span class="italic">Marsh v. Lott,</span> p. 647. Such recitals, if given effect, reduce consideration to a formality. The Restatement, Second, Contracts, however, generally refuses to give effect to false recitals of consideration except in certain special situations. Section 218 provides:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 218. Untrue Recitals; Evidence of Consideration.</span></h4>
<p class="list_alpha">(1) A recital of a fact in an integrated agreement may be shown to be untrue.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) Evidence is admissible to prove whether or not there is consideration for a promise, even though the parties have reduced their agreement to a writing which appears to be a completely integrated agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">And Comment e explains this:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Where consideration is required, the requirement is not satisfied by a false recital of consideration, although in some circumstances a recital of consideration may make a promise binding without consideration. See §§ 71, 87, 88. An incorrect statement of a consideration does not prevent proof either that there was no consideration or that there was a consideration different from that stated. In some such cases the recital may imply a promise not explicitly stated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The reference to § 71 apparently is to Comment b that says in part:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">But it is not enough that the promise induces the conduct of the promisee or that the conduct of the promisee induces the making of the promise; both elements must be present, or there is no bargain. Moreover, a mere pretense of bargain does not suffice, as where there is a false recital of consideration or where the purported consideration is merely nominal. In such cases there is no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page574" class="pagebreak">574</span>consideration and the promise is enforced, if at all, as a promise binding without consideration under §§ 82–94….</p>
<p class="noindent">The other references in this Comment to § 71 are to sections dealing with options and guaranties where the Restatement explicitly declares binding a writing that recites “a purported consideration” and the Comments make clear that the enforceability of the option or guaranty is not diminished if the recital is of merely nominal consideration or is false.</p>
<p class="indent">The experience of continental civil law systems suggests that a single formality cannot resolve all the problems surrounding gift promises. In both French and German law, for instance, consideration as we know it is not required, but as Professor Melvin Eisenberg indicates, clarifying the possibility of enforceable gift promises is not the end of the matter:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Under the German Civil Code, a donative promise is normally enforceable to its full extent only if it is in writing and authenticated by a notary. Under French law a donative promise is normally enforceable to its full extent only if it is executed in writing before two notaries, or a notary and two witnesses, and formally accepted by the promisee, or is cast in the form known as disguised donation (a transaction that falsely appears to be something other than a gift, such as a pretended bargain or the acknowledgment of a nonexistent debt). A major aim of these formalities, like the intended effect of the Written Obligations Act, is to bring home to the promisor that he is entering into a transaction with legal implications. In the case of notarial authentication, this is accomplished by involving a specifically legal figure: the French notary has traditionally combined the roles of official, family counselor, and legal specialist in the drafting of personal instruments such as conveyances and wills; the German notary plays similar roles. In the case of a disguised donation, the legal implications of the promisor’s acts are brought home by the fact that he “must so arrange the contract containing the gift as to give it the appearance of an onerous judicial act. The donor is thus clearly aware of the scope of his obligation.”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Such formalities certainly address the problems of deliberative intent and evidentiary security. Form alone, however, cannot meet the problems of improvidence and ingratitude. Accordingly, the French and German Civil Codes do not stop their treatment of donative promises at the formal level, but instead go on to provide extensive treatment of circumstances arising after the promise has been made. For example, under article 519 of the German Civil Code, “[a] donor is entitled to refuse fulfillment of a promise made gratuitously insofar as, having regard to his other obligations, he is not in a position to fulfill the promise without endangering his own reasonable maintenance or the fulfillment of obligations imposed upon him by law to furnish maintenance to others.” Under article 530(1), a donative promise may be revoked “if the donee, by any serious <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page575" class="pagebreak">575</span>misconduct towards the donor or a close relative of the donor shows himself guilty of gross ingratitude.” Under the French Civil Code, a donative promise made by a person with no living descendants is normally revoked by operation of law upon the birth of a child, and a donative promise can be revoked on the ground of ingratitude involving such matters as serious cruelty, wrongs, or injuries (<span class="italic">sévices, délits ou injures grave</span>). Both Codes carry this approach to its logical conclusion by making even completed gifts revocable under comparable circumstances, and both Codes place substantial limits on the power of an individual to disenfranchise his immediate family by either gift or will.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">As these rules suggest, our legal system could not appropriately follow the lead of the civil law by making donative promises enforceable on the basis of their form—as through recognition of nominal consideration—unless we were also prepared to follow the civil law by developing and administering a body of rules dealing with the problems of improvidence and ingratitude. Certainly such an enterprise is possible. It may be questioned, however, whether the game would be worth the candle. An inquiry into improvidence involves the measurement of wealth, lifestyle, dependents’ needs, and even personal utilities. An inquiry into ingratitude involves the measurement of a maelstrom, since many or most donative promises arise in an intimate context in which emotions, motives, and cues are invariably complex and highly interrelated. Perhaps the civil-law style of adjudication is suited to wrestling with these kinds of inquiries, but they have held little appeal for common-law courts, which have traditionally been oriented toward inquiry into acts rather than into personal characteristics.</p>

All of these statutes are descendants of the English Statute of Frauds. This area of law can be studied in detail only in the context of the specific statute in force in a given state.

<p class="indent">Additional Statute of Frauds provisions are now apt to be scattered through a state’s statute books. Thus, when California adopted the UCC, its writing requirement for sales of goods contracts was relocated from Civil Code § 1624 to the Commercial Code and conformed to the UCC:</p>

<p class="list_alpha">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker.

<p id="sec278" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1.</span> In applying UCC § 2-201 in <span class="italic">Am. Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. U.S. Ferrous Trading Div.</span>, 2007 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 27847 (D. Conn. Apr. 16, 2007), the Court was faced with an agreement evidenced by emails regarding a domestic sale of goods that omitted material terms and signatures. AIM claimed Tube had breached a contract to purchase scrap metal from AIM for resale to an Egyptian buyer. Two e-mails evidenced this transaction. A June 23 e-mail from Tube’s managing director to AIM’s CEO stated:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“Thanks for your offer per phone earlier today, i.e,. about 25–30,000 MT HSMI, your option, about 10-5000 MT P&amp;S your option, about 30–35,000 MT total, your option for shipment anytime August 2006, your option-Price: HMS-USD 300/MT-P&amp;S USD 305/MT-The Egyptians said they’d open their L/C within 5 working days. We’d expect to pay you out of that L/C, without any out-of-pocket expenses against our small commission (which we’d have to share with the Egyptian agent), e.g., banking expenses, survey fees. Thanks for your support. Let’s keep our fingers crossed for our joint efforts to be successful.”</p>
<p class="noindent">A June 26 e-mail from the same sender to the same recipient read:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“Following our telecon earlier today, we hereby confirm that the Egyptians accepted your/our firm counter as per our [June 23, 2006] email. They require, however, that 97% of the cargo value is payable against shipping documents under their L/C and the balance after completion of discharge and draft survey there by SGS at both ends (also for quality inspection at loadport and final there!) with average of both SGS surveys to be the final weight. This is standard in Egypt and we hope acceptable to you too… . If you have any further questions, please let me know. Otherwise please o.k. and we’ll proceed issuing the corresponding contract.”</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsequently, the market price dropped. Tube repudiated the contract and defended on the ground that the agreement was not sufficiently memorialized in a writing. The Court found the statute of frauds was satisfied, noting that UCC § 2–201 does not even require the parties to be identified as buyer or seller, or the writing to be complete or include certain terms such as the price term. It must only manifest the intention of the parties to be bound. Extrinsic evidence clarified the meaning of the shorthand expressions used in the email. Moreover, UCC § 2-201(2) does not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page579" class="pagebreak">579</span>require a signature of the party to be charged where the agreement is between merchants. An otherwise sufficient writing sent by one merchant to another binds the non-signing merchant unless that merchant objects to the writing within ten days of its receipt. The only required term in the writing is the quantity term. Stating the quantity in “ranges” qualified by “about” met the UCC requirement.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. An important change in the Statute of Frauds occurred in 1986 when the United States acceded to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, effective January 1, 1988. Article 11 of the CISG provides:</p>
<p class="blockquote">A contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not subject to any other requirements as to form. It may be proved by any means, including witnesses.</p>
<p class="indent">Article 12 of the convention allows nations that are party to it to make a formal declaration that Article 11 does not apply when any party to the contract has its place of business in that nation but the United States has not made that declaration. Under the federal Constitution, treaties, like federal statutes, are the supreme law of the land and preempt inconsistent state statutes. The law of all fifty states on a subject that had been a matter of quite uniform state law for several centuries has therefore been displaced with respect to transactions between Americans and persons with a place of business in another nation signatory to the convention.</p>

<p class="noindent">…</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. F<small>ACTUAL AND</small> P<small>ROCEDURAL</small> B<small>ACKGROUND</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">In January 2000, defendant Lawrence Taylor and plaintiff Donald Sterling discussed the sale of three apartment buildings in Santa Monica owned by the Santa Monica Collection partnership (SMC). Defendant was a general partner in SMC. Plaintiff and defendant, both experienced real estate investors, met on March 13, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page580" class="pagebreak">580</span>2000 and discussed a series of transactions including the purchase of the SMC properties. At this meeting, plaintiff drafted a handwritten memorandum entitled “Contract for Sale of Real Property.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_111" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-111" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The memorandum encompasses the sale of five properties; only the SMC properties are involved here. They are identified in the memorandum as “808 4th St.,” “843 4th St.,” and “1251 14th St.,” with an aggregate price term of “approx. 10.468 X gross income[,] estimated income 1.600.000, <span class="italic">Price $16,750.</span>00.” Although defendant had given plaintiff rent rolls showing the income from the properties, neither man brought these documents to the March 13 meeting. Plaintiff dated and initialed the memorandum as “Buyer,” but the line he provided for “Seller” was left blank. Plaintiff contends the omission was inadvertent. Defendant, however, asserts he did not sign the document because he needed approval from a majority of SMC’s limited partners.</p>
<p class="indent">On March 15, 2000, plaintiff wrote to defendant, referring to the properties by street address only, and stating “[t]his letter will confirm our contract of sale of the above buildings.” The letter discussed deposits plaintiff had given to defendant, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page581" class="pagebreak">581</span>noted “our agreement that the depreciation allocation and tax benefits will be given to me no later than April 1, 2000, since I now have equitable tittle [<span class="italic">sic</span> ].” Price terms were not mentioned. Both parties signed the letter, defendant beneath the handwritten notation “Agreed, Accepted, &amp; Approved.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff claims the March 13 memorandum was attached to the March 15 letter, which defendant annotated and signed in his presence. Defendant insists nothing was attached to the March 15 letter, which he did not sign until March 30. According to defendant, his signature reflected only an accommodation to acknowledge the deposits he had received from plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">On April 4, 2000, defendant sent plaintiff three formal purchase agreements with escrow instructions, identifying the properties by their legal descriptions. SMC was named as the seller and the Sterling Family Trust as the buyer. The price terms totalled $16,750,000. Defendant signed the agreements as a general partner of SMC. Plaintiff refused to sign. Defendant claims plaintiff telephoned on April 28, saying the purchase price was unacceptable. Plaintiff asserts that after reviewing the rent rolls, he determined the actual rental income from the SMC buildings was $1,375,404, not $1,600,000 as estimated on the March 13 memorandum. Plaintiff claims he tried to have defendant correct the escrow instructions, but defendant did not return his calls. Plaintiff wanted to lower the price to $14,404,841, based on the actual rental income figure and the 10.468 multiplier noted in the memorandum.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_112" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-112" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff did not ask for the $16,750.00 purchase price stated in the memorandum. He admits that he “accidentally left off one zero” when he wrote down that figure. Defendant also acknowledges that the price recorded on the memorandum was meant to be $16,750,000.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_113" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-113" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Defendant returned plaintiff’s uncashed deposit checks on May 23. The parties conducted further negotiations in December 2000 and January 2001. Defendant provided additional rent rolls, but no agreement was reached.</p>
<p class="indent">In March 2001 the trustees of the Sterling Family Trust sued Taylor, SMC, and related entities, alleging breach of a written contract to sell the properties for a total price of $14,404,841. The March 13 memorandum and the March 15 letter were attached to the complaint as the “Purchase Agreement.” The complaint included causes of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page582" class="pagebreak">582</span>specific performance, declaratory relief, an accounting, intentional misrepresentation, and imposition of a constructive trust.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants sought summary judgment, claiming that no contract was formed, the alleged contract violated the statute of frauds, and plaintiffs could not prove fraud. Defendants contended the memorandum and letter did not satisfy the statute because they established no agreement on price, failed to sufficiently identify either the contracting parties or the properties, and were not signed by Taylor and Christina Development. The trial court granted summary judgment. It ruled that the price term was too uncertain to be enforced and the writings did not comply with the statute of frauds. The court also concluded that the undisputed facts disclosed neither a fraudulent intent on defendant’s part nor damages to plaintiff, thus foreclosing the misrepresentation claim.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeal reversed as to the contract causes of action, but remanded for entry of summary adjudication in defendants’ favor on the fraud claim. The court held that Taylor’s name and signature on the writings submitted by plaintiffs satisfied the statute of frauds. It also deemed the identification of the properties by street address sufficient, in light of extrinsic evidence specifying the city and state. Likewise, the court held that the price terms in the March 13 memorandum, while ambiguous, could be clarified by examining extrinsic evidence. It concluded that defendants’ evidence raised a triable issue as to whether the parties had agreed on a formula for determining the purchase price. The court further ruled that the fraud claim failed because plaintiffs could not prove damages. Only the contract claims are at issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II. D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants contend the Court of Appeal improperly considered extrinsic evidence to establish essential contract terms. They insist the statute of frauds requires a memorandum that, standing alone, supplies all material elements of the contract. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that extrinsic evidence is routinely admitted for the purpose of determining whether memoranda comply with the statute of frauds.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_114" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-114" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Both sides of this debate find support in California case law, sometimes in the same opinion. Part A of our discussion explains that plaintiffs’ view is correct. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page583" class="pagebreak">583</span>statute of frauds does not preclude the admission of evidence in any form; it imposes a writing requirement, but not a comprehensive one. In part B, however, we conclude that defendants are nevertheless entitled to judgment. The Court of Appeal properly considered the parties’ extrinsic evidence, but erroneously deemed it legally sufficient under the statute of frauds to establish the price sought by plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">A. The Memorandum Requirement of the Statute of Frauds</span></p>
<p class="indent">The statute of frauds does not require a written contract; a “note or memorandum … subscribed by the party to be charged” is adequate. (Civ.Code, § 1624, subd. (a).)<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_115" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-115" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup> In <span class="italic">Crowley v. Modern Faucet Mfg. Co.</span> (1955), we observed that “[a] written memorandum is not identical with a written contract [citation]; it is merely evidence of it and usually does not contain all of the terms.” Indeed, in most instances it is not even necessary that the parties intended the memorandum to serve a contractual purpose. (Rest.2d Contracts, § 133; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <span class="italic">supra</span>.)</p>
<p class="indent">A memorandum satisfies the statute of frauds if it identifies the subject of the parties’ agreement, shows that they made a contract, and states the essential contract terms with reasonable certainty. “Only the essential terms must be stated, details or particulars need not [be]. What is essential depends on the agreement and its context and also on the subsequent conduct of the parties….” (Rest.2d Contracts, § 131, com. <span class="italic">g</span>).</p>
<p class="indent">This court recently observed that the writing requirement of the statute of frauds “serves only to prevent the contract from being unenforceable; it does not necessarily establish the terms of the parties’ contract.” (<span class="italic">Casa Herrera, Inc. v. Beydoun</span> (2004). Unlike the parol evidence rule, which “determines the enforceable and incontrovertible terms of an integrated written agreement,” the statute of frauds “merely serve[s] an evidentiary purpose.” (<span class="italic">Ibid.</span>) As the drafters of the Second Restatement of Contracts explained: “The primary purpose of the Statute is evidentiary, to require reliable evidence of the existence and terms of the contract and to prevent enforcement through fraud or perjury of contracts never in fact made. The contents of the writing must be such as to make successful fraud unlikely, but the possibility need not be excluded that some other subject matter or person than those intended will also fall within the words of the writing. Where only an evidentiary purpose is served, <span class="italic">the requirement of a memorandum is read in the light of the dispute which arises and the admissions of the party to be charged;</span> there is no need for evidence on points not in dispute.” (Rest.2d Contracts, § 131, com. <span class="italic">c</span>, italics added).</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page584" class="pagebreak">584</div>
<p class="indent">Thus, when ambiguous terms in a memorandum are disputed, extrinsic evidence is admissible to resolve the uncertainty. Extrinsic evidence can also support reformation of a memorandum to correct a mistake. (Rest.2d Contracts, § 131, com. <span class="italic">g</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Because the memorandum itself must include the essential contractual terms, it is clear that extrinsic evidence cannot <span class="italic">supply</span> those required terms. It can, however, be used to <span class="italic">explain</span> essential terms that were understood by the parties but would otherwise be unintelligible to others. Two early cases from this court demonstrate that a memorandum can satisfy the statute of frauds, even if its terms are too uncertain to be enforceable when considered by themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Preble v. Abrahams</span> (1891), a written agreement for the sale of land described the property to be sold as “forty acres of the eighty-acre tract at Biggs.”<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_116" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-116" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></sup> The court observed: “An agreement not in writing for the sale and purchase of real estate is void. And the description of the property in the written agreement is so entirely uncertain as to render the instrument inoperative and void, unless we can go beyond the face of it to ascertain its meaning.”</p>
<p class="indent">To give effect to the agreement, the <span class="italic">Preble</span> court relied on extrinsic evidence that another buyer had purchased one 40–acre tract and the defendant had agreed to purchase the remainder. “We think the evidence makes the subject-matter sufficiently certain, and that is all that is necessary. Professor Pomeroy says: ‘It is not strictly accurate to say that the subject-matter must be absolutely certain from the writing itself, or by reference to some other writing. The true rule is, that the situation of the parties and the surrounding circumstances, when the contract was made, can be shown by parol evidence, so that the court may be placed in the position of the parties themselves; and if <span class="italic">then</span> the subject-matter is identified, and the terms appear reasonably certain, it is enough.’ (Pomeroy on Contracts, sec. 227, note.)”</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Brewer v. Horst–Lachmund Co.</span> (1900), a contract was memorialized by two telegrams employing a form of shorthand notation so arcane that “[i]f there were nothing to look to but the telegrams, the court might find it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the nature of the contract, or that any contract was entered into between the parties.” The defendant contended the telegrams were an insufficient “note or memorandum” to satisfy the statute of frauds. The <span class="italic">Brewer</span> court disagreed, stating: “[T]he court is permitted to interpret the memorandum (consisting of the two telegrams) by the light of all the circumstances under which it was made; and if, when the court is put into possession of all the knowledge which the parties to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page585" class="pagebreak">585</span>transaction had at the time, it can be plainly seen from the memorandum who the parties to the contract were, what the subject of the contract was, and what were its terms, then the court should not hesitate to hold the memorandum sufficient. Oral evidence may be received to show in what sense figures or abbreviations were used; and their meaning may be explained as it was understood between the parties.” (<span class="italic">Ibid.</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Reading the telegrams “by the light of the circumstances surrounding the parties,” the <span class="italic">Brewer</span> court concluded it was clear that they referred to a contract for the purchase of 296 bales of hops on terms understood by the parties. The facts of <span class="italic">Brewer</span> were adapted by the drafters of the Restatements as an illustration of a sufficient memorandum for purposes of the statute of frauds. (Rest.2d Contracts, § 131, com. <span class="italic">e</span>, illus. 7; and see <span class="italic">id.,</span> Reptr.’s Note.)</p>
<p class="indent">Despite this venerable authority, conflicting statements appear in other California cases…. Defendants rely on these and similar cases to argue that the Court of Appeal improperly considered extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of essential but imperfectly stated terms in the memorandum drafted by plaintiff Sterling.</p>
<p class="indent">To clarify the law on this point, we disapprove the statements in California cases barring consideration of extrinsic evidence to determine the sufficiency of a memorandum under the statute of frauds. The purposes of the statute are not served by such a rigid rule, which has never been a consistent feature of the common law. Corbin observes: “Judicial dicta abound to the effect that the writing must contain all of the ‘essential terms and conditions’ of the contract, and it is often said that these must be so clear as to be understood ‘without any aid from parol testimony.’ But the long course of judicial decision shows that ‘essential terms and conditions’ is itself a term of considerable flexibility and that the courts do not in fact blind themselves by excluding parol testimony when it is a necessary aid to understanding.” (4 Corbin on Contracts (rev. ed.1997) § 22.2).</p>
<p class="indent">“Some confusion is attributable to a failure to keep clearly in mind the purpose of the statute and the informal character of the evidence that the actual words of the statute require; some is no doubt due to differences in the attitude of the judges as to the beneficence of the statute and the wisdom of its existence.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_117" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-117" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></sup> Further, there are differences in the strictness of judicial requirements as to the contents of the memorandum. It is believed that sometimes these apparent differences can be explained by the degree of doubt existing in the court’s mind as to the actual making and performance of the alleged contract. The better and the more disinterested is the oral testimony offered by the plaintiff, the more convincing the corroboration that is found in the surrounding circumstances, and the more limited the disputed issue <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page586" class="pagebreak">586</span>because of admissions made by the defendant, the less that should be and is required of the written memorandum.” (4 Corbin on Contracts, <span class="italic">supra,</span> § 22.2).</p>
<p class="indent">Williston offers similar counsel: “In determining the requisites and meaning of a ‘note or memorandum in writing,’ courts often look to the origin and fundamental purpose of the Statute of Frauds. In fact, a failure to do so will often result in a futile preoccupation with the numerous and conflicting precepts and decisions involving the clauses providing for a note or memorandum, and a corresponding failure to see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p class="indent">“The Statute of Frauds was not enacted to afford persons a means of evading just obligations; nor was it intended to supply a cloak of immunity to hedging litigants lacking integrity; nor was it adopted to enable defendants to interpose the Statute as a bar to a contract fairly, and admittedly, made. In brief, the Statute ‘was intended to guard against the perils of perjury and error in the spoken word.’ Therefore, if after a consideration of the surrounding circumstances, the pertinent facts and all the evidence in a particular case, the court concludes that enforcement of the agreement will not subject the defendant to fraudulent claims, the purpose of the Statute will best be served by holding the note or memorandum sufficient even though it is ambiguous or incomplete.” (10 Williston on Contracts (4th ed.1999) § 29:4).<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_118" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-118" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The governing principle is: “That is certain which can be made certain.” (Civ.Code, § 3538) We hold that if a memorandum includes the essential terms of the parties’ agreement, but the meaning of those terms is unclear, the memorandum is sufficient under the statute of frauds if extrinsic evidence clarifies the terms with reasonable certainty and the evidence as a whole demonstrates that the parties intended to be bound. Conflicts in the extrinsic evidence are for the trier of fact to resolve, but whether the evidence meets the standard of reasonable certainty is a question of law for the court.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_119" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-119" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">We emphasize that a memorandum of the parties’ agreement is <span class="italic">controlling</span> evidence under the statute of frauds. Thus, extrinsic evidence cannot be employed to prove an agreement at odds with the terms of the memorandum. This point was made in <span class="italic">Beazell v. Schrader</span> (1963). There, the plaintiff sought to recover a 5 percent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page587" class="pagebreak">587</span>real estate broker’s commission under an oral agreement. The escrow instructions, which specified a 1.25 percent commission, were the “memorandum” on which the plaintiff relied to comply with the statute. However, he contended the instructions incorrectly reflected the parties’ actual agreement, as shown by extrinsic evidence. The <span class="italic">Beazell</span> court rejected this argument, holding that under the statute of frauds, “the parol agreement of which the writing is a memorandum must be one whose terms are consistent with the terms of the memorandum.” Thus, in determining whether extrinsic evidence provides the certainty required by the statute, courts must bear in mind that the evidence cannot contradict the terms of the writing.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">B. The Sufficiency of This Memorandum</span></p>
<p class="indent">As noted above, it is a question of law whether a memorandum, considered in light of the circumstances surrounding its making, complies with the statute of frauds. Accordingly, the issue is generally amenable to resolution by summary judgment. We independently review the record to determine whether a triable issue of fact might defeat the statute of frauds defense in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">A memorandum of a contract for the sale of real property must identify the buyer, the seller, the price, and the property.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_120" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-120" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span></sup> (<span class="italic">King v. Stanley</span> (1948). Defendants contend the memorandum drafted by plaintiff Sterling fails to adequately specify the seller, the property, or the price.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_121" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-121" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeal correctly held that the seller and the properties were sufficiently identified. The parties themselves displayed no uncertainty as to those terms before their dispute over the price arose. It is a “cardinal rule of construction that when a contract is ambiguous or uncertain the practical construction placed upon it by the parties before any controversy arises as to its meaning affords one of the most reliable means of determining the intent of the parties.” (<span class="italic">Bohman v. Berg</span> (1960)) The same rule governs the interpretation of a memorandum under the statute of frauds. (See Rest.2d Contracts, § 131, com. <span class="italic">g</span>)<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_122" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></sup></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page588" class="pagebreak">588</div>
<p class="indent">The memorandum referred to “Seller Larry Taylor, &amp; Christina Development.” Defendants argue that the omission of the actual owner of the properties, SMC, is fatal. However, they do not dispute Taylor’s authorization to act as SMC’s agent, or his actual performance of that role. A contract made in the name of an agent may be enforced against an undisclosed principal, and extrinsic evidence is admissible to identify the principal. If a term is stated in a memorandum with sufficient certainty to be enforced, it satisfies the statute of frauds. Therefore, the reference to Taylor was adequate, regardless of the apparently mistaken inclusion of Christina Development.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, while the properties were identified in the memorandum only by street address, neither party displayed any confusion over their actual location. The purchase agreements Taylor prepared included full legal descriptions, and when Sterling received those agreements he did not object that he wanted to buy buildings on 4th and 14th Streets in Manhattan rather than Santa Monica. In any event, the better view has long been that extrinsic evidence may be consulted to locate property described in imprecise terms, even though a memorandum with a more complete description would be preferable.</p>
<p class="indent">As defendants forthrightly conceded in the trial court, “[t]he problem here is the price term.” The Court of Appeal concluded that the lines in the memorandum stating “approx. 10.468 X gross income[,] estimated income 1.600.000, <span class="italic">Price $16,750.</span>00 ” were ambiguous, given the use of the modifier “approx.” before the multiplier, the omitted zero in the price, and the uncertain meaning of “gross income.” The court then considered Sterling’s testimony that “approx.” was meant to modify the total price, not the multiplier; that the missing zero was merely an error; and that “gross income” was used by the parties to refer to actual gross annual income. It decided that this evidence, if accepted by the trier of fact, could establish an agreement to determine the price based on a formula, which would be binding under <span class="italic">Carver v. Teitsworth</span> (1991). In <span class="italic">Carver,</span> a bid for either a specified price or $1,000 over any higher bid was deemed sufficiently certain.</p>
<p class="indent">In this court, plaintiffs also cite <span class="italic">Cal. Lettuce Growers v. Union Sugar Co.</span> (1955), to show that a price term may be calculated from a formula. There, a price formula was derived from industry custom and the parties’ past practice. Plaintiffs contend the parties here negotiated a 10.468 multiplier to be applied to the actual gross rental income from the buildings in March 2000, as indicated by the fact that Taylor gave Sterling rent rolls before their March 13 meeting.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeal erred by deeming Sterling’s testimony sufficient to establish his interpretation of the memorandum for purposes of the statute of frauds. Had Taylor testified that the parties meant to leave the price open to determination based on a rental income figure that was yet to be determined, this would be a different case. Then, the “admissions of the party to be charged” might have supported a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page589" class="pagebreak">589</span>reasonably certain price term derived from a negotiated formula. (Rest.2d Contracts, § 131, com. c.) Here, however, Taylor insists the price was meant to be $16,750,000, and Sterling agrees that was the number he intended to write down, underlined, as the “Price.”</p>
<p class="indent">$16,750,000 is clearly an approximate product of the formula specified in the memorandum, applied to the income figure stated there.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_123" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-123" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span></sup> On the other hand, Sterling’s asserted price of $14,404,841 cannot reasonably be considered an approximation of $16,750,000. It is instead an approximate product of the formula applied to an actual income figure not found in the memorandum. The writing does not include the term “actual gross income,” nor does it state that the price term will vary depending on proof or later agreement regarding the actual rental income from the buildings. In effect, Sterling would employ only the first part of the price term (“approx. 10.468 X gross income”) and ignore the last parts (“estimated income 1.600.000, <span class="italic">Price $16,750.</span>00 ”). He would hold Taylor to a price that is 10.468 times the actual rental income figure gleaned from the rent rolls, but only “approximately” so because of Sterling’s computational errors.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, two competing interpretations of the memorandum were before the court. Taylor’s is consistent with the figures provided in the memorandum, requiring only the correction of the price by reference to undisputed extrinsic evidence. Sterling’s price is not stated in the memorandum, and depends on extrinsic evidence in the form of his own testimony, disputed by Taylor, that the parties intended to apply the formula to actual gross rental income instead of the estimated income noted in the memorandum. Even if the trier of fact were to accept Sterling’s version of the parties’ negotiations, the price he seeks is not reflected in the memorandum; indeed, it is inconsistent with the price term that appears in the memorandum. Under these circumstances, we conclude the evidence is insufficient to establish Sterling’s price term with the reasonable certainty required by the statute of frauds.</p>
<p class="indent">The statute of frauds demands written evidence that reflects the parties’ mutual understanding of the essential terms of their agreement, when viewed in light of the transaction at issue and the dispute before the court. The writing requirement is intended to permit the enforcement of agreements actually reached, but “to prevent enforcement through fraud or perjury of contracts never in fact made.” (Rest.2d Contracts, § 131, com. c.) The sufficiency of a memorandum to fulfill this purpose may depend on the quality of the extrinsic evidence offered to explain its terms. In <span class="italic">Preble v. Abrahams,</span> the memorandum failed to describe the property to be sold with any certainty, but extrinsic evidence established that the parties could only have been referring to the portion of a tract that was not sold to another buyer. Similarly, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page590" class="pagebreak">590</span>in <span class="italic">Brewer v. Horst–Lachmund Co.</span>, telegrams that were otherwise inscrutable demonstrated an ascertainable agreement when the court considered the circumstances of the transaction and the parties’ understanding of the terms employed.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, unlike in the <span class="italic">Preble</span> and <span class="italic">Brewer</span> cases, the extrinsic evidence offered by plaintiffs is at odds with the writing, which states a specific price and does not indicate that the parties contemplated any change based on actual rental income. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to show with reasonable certainty that the parties understood and agreed to the price alleged by plaintiffs. The price terms stated in the memorandum, considered together with the extrinsic evidence of the contemplated price, leave a degree of doubt that the statute of frauds does not tolerate. The trial court properly granted defendants summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ K<small>ENNARD</small>, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">I agree with the majority that extrinsic evidence is admissible to resolve the meaning of an ambiguity in a written memorandum required by the statute of frauds as evidence of an agreement, and that conflicts in the evidence are for the trier of fact to resolve. The majority, however, goes astray when it takes it upon itself to resolve an existing conflict in the evidence. In my view, the ambiguity in the language of the memorandum at issue should be resolved by the trier of fact.</p>
<p class="noindent">…</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The parties’ dispute here centers on whether the price description in the memorandum is ambiguous so that extrinsic evidence is admissible to clarify its meaning and satisfy the statute of frauds. Regarding price the memorandum states: “approx. 10.468 X gross income [¶] estimated income 1.600.000, <span class="italic">Price $16,750,000.</span>” Plaintiff claims that the word “approx.” modified the entire statement, not just “10.468 X gross income,” and that the parties understood the term “gross income” to mean actual annual gross rental income. In other words, plaintiff’s position is that the memorandum sets forth a formula for determining the actual price—10.468 multiplied by actual annual gross rental income, which results in a price of $14,404,841—and that the reference to “<span class="italic">Price $16,750,000</span> ” is an estimate of the actual price, determined by application of the formula just mentioned, albeit using a somewhat inaccurate estimate of gross annual rental income. (See e.g., <span class="italic">Cal. Lettuce Growers v. Union Sugar Co.</span> (1955) [price need not be specified if it can be objectively determined]; <span class="italic">Carver v. Teitsworth</span> (1991) [same].) Defendant disagrees, contending that the memorandum’s mention of “<span class="italic">Price $16,750,000</span> ” reflects the actual purchase price agreed upon by the parties. Both have a point.</p>
<p class="indent">As the Court of Appeal observed, the language in the memorandum is ambiguous; that is, it can reasonably be read as each party proposes. To accept plaintiff’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page591" class="pagebreak">591</span>argument would give meaning to the language in the disputed statement of “10.468 X gross income [¶] estimated 1.600.000.” To accept defendant’s argument would give meaning to the term “<span class="italic">Price $16,750,000.</span>” Which view should be accepted is a determination to be made by the trier of fact, based on its consideration of the extrinsic evidence presented. Either way, the trier of fact’s resolution would result in a specific purchase price: one arrived at through application of a formula expressed in the memorandum, the other through acceptance of the figure $16,750,000 mentioned in the memorandum.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority, however, simply adopts defendant’s view instead of leaving it to the trier of fact to resolve the conflict in the evidence. In accepting defendant’s view, the majority rejects plaintiff’s view as attempting to alter rather than explain the terms of the memorandum. I disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">Apparently based on its own evaluation of the evidence, which as discussed above is conflicting, the majority takes it upon itself to decide that the agreed price was $16,750,000 and then concludes that any extrinsic evidence presented by plaintiff would be inconsistent with that figure. The majority reasons that plaintiff is looking only to the first part of the memorandum’s price description of “approx. 10.468 X gross income,” while ignoring the last part stating “estimated income 1.600.000, <span class="italic">Price $16,750,000.</span>” This is both a misapprehension of plaintiff’s view and a failure to appreciate that defendant’s view too is not free from ambiguity.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff’s position that the memorandum sets forth a formula for determining the price does not ignore the memorandum’s reference to “estimated income 1.600.000, <span class="italic">Price $16,750,000.</span>” According to plaintiff, the memorandum’s <span class="italic">stated</span> price is itself an <span class="italic">estimate,</span> for it is the product of the <span class="italic">estimated</span> income of 1.600.000 times 10.468, while the <span class="italic">actual</span> price is to be determined by using the formula 10.468 multiplied by the <span class="italic">actual</span> gross income, resulting in a price of $14,404,841. Defendant’s view that the actual price is $16,750,000 finds support in the memorandum’s mention of “<span class="italic">Price $16,750,000</span> ” but it ignores the memorandum’s formula that plaintiff relies on. Unlike the majority, I see no reason to reject plaintiff’s position as a matter of law when the purchase terms in the memorandum are ambiguous and are as reasonably susceptible to plaintiff’s position as to defendant’s. I would leave it to the trier of fact to resolve the ambiguity.</p>
<p id="sec280" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS</span></p>

<p id="sec281" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">McIntosh v. Murphy</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">Hawaii Supreme Court, 1970.</p>
<p class="sectionb">52 Haw. 29, 469 P.2d 177.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ L<small>EVINSON</small>, J. This case involves an oral employment contract which allegedly violates the provision of the Statute of Frauds requiring “any agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof” to be in writing in order to be enforceable. In this action the plaintiff-employee Dick McIntosh seeks to recover damages from his employer, George Murphy and Murphy Motors, Ltd., for the breach of an alleged one-year oral employment contract.</p>
<p class="indent">While the facts are in sharp conflict, it appears that defendant George Murphy was in southern California during March, 1964 interviewing prospective management personnel for his Chevrolet–Oldsmobile dealerships in Hawaii. He interviewed the plaintiff twice during that time. The position of sales manager for one of the dealerships was fully discussed but no contract was entered into. In April, 1964 the plaintiff received a call from the general manager of Murphy Motors informing him of possible employment within thirty days if he was still available. The plaintiff indicated his continued interest and informed the manager that he would be available. Later in April, the plaintiff sent Murphy a telegram to the effect that he would arrive in Honolulu on Sunday, April 26, 1964. Murphy then telephoned McIntosh on Saturday, April 25, 1964 to notify him that the job of assistant sales manager was open and work would begin on the following Monday, April 27, 1964. At that time McIntosh expressed surprise at the change in job title from sales manager to assistant sales manager but reconfirmed the fact that he was arriving in Honolulu the next day, Sunday. McIntosh arrived on Sunday, April 26, 1964 and began work on the following day, Monday, April 27, 1964.</p>
<p class="indent">As a consequence of his decision to work for Murphy, McIntosh moved some of his belongings from the mainland to Hawaii, sold other possessions, leased an apartment in Honolulu and obviously forwent any other employment opportunities. In short, the plaintiff did all those things which were incidental to changing one’s residence permanently from Los Angeles to Honolulu, a distance of approximately 2200 miles. McIntosh continued working for Murphy until July 16, 1964, approximately two and one-half months, at which time he was discharged on the grounds that he was unable to close deals with prospective customers and could not train the salesmen.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page593" class="pagebreak">593</div>
<p class="indent">At the conclusion of the trial, the defense moved for a directed verdict arguing that the oral employment agreement was in violation of the Statute of Frauds, there being no written memorandum or note thereof. The trial court ruled that as a matter of law the contract did not come within the Statute, reasoning that Murphy bargained for acceptance by the actual commencement of performance by McIntosh, so that McIntosh was not bound by a contract until he came to work on Monday, April 27, 1964. Therefore, assuming that the contract was for a year’s employment, it was performable within a year exactly to the day and no writing was required for it to be enforceable. Alternatively, the court ruled that if the agreement was made final by the telephone call between the parties on Saturday, April 25, 1964, then that part of the weekend which remained would not be counted in calculating the year, thus taking the contract out of the Statute of Frauds. With commendable candor the trial judge gave as the motivating force for the decision his desire to avoid a mechanical and unjust application of the Statute.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_124" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The case went to the jury on the following questions: (1) whether the contract was for a year’s duration or was performable on a trial basis, thus making it terminable at the will of either party; (2) whether the plaintiff was discharged for just cause; and (3) if he was not discharged for just cause, what damages were due the plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $12,103.40. The defendants appeal to this court on four principal grounds, three of which we find to be without merit. The remaining ground of appeal is whether the plaintiff can maintain an action on the alleged oral employment contract in light of the prohibition of the Statute of Frauds making unenforceable an oral contract that is not to be performed within one year.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I. T<small>IME OF</small> A<small>CCEPTANCE OF THE</small> E<small>MPLOYMENT</small> A<small>GREEMENT</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The defendants contend that the trial court erred in refusing to give an instruction to the jury that if the employment agreement was made more than one day before the plaintiff began performance, there could be no recovery by the plaintiff. The reason given was that a contract not to be performed within one year from its making is unenforceable if not in writing.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants are correct in their argument that the time of acceptance of an offer is a question of fact for the jury to decide. But the trial court alternatively decided that even if the offer was accepted on the Saturday prior to the commencement of performance, the intervening Sunday and part of Saturday would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page594" class="pagebreak">594</span>not be counted in computing the year for the purposes of the Statute of Frauds. The judge stated that Sunday was a non-working day and only a fraction of Saturday was left which he would not count. In any event, there is no need to discuss the relative merits of either ruling since we base our decision in this case on the doctrine of equitable estoppel which was properly briefed and argued by both parties before this court, although not presented to the trial court.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II. E<small>NFORCEMENT BY</small> V<small>IRTUE OF</small> A<small>CTION IN</small> R<small>ELIANCE ON THE</small> O<small>RAL</small> C<small>ONTRACT</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">In determining whether a rule of law can be fashioned and applied to a situation where an oral contract admittedly violates a strict interpretation of the Statute of Frauds, it is necessary to review the Statute itself together with its historical and modern functions. The Statute of Frauds, which requires that certain contracts be in writing in order to be legally enforceable, had its inception in the days of Charles II of England. Hawaii’s version of the Statute is found in HRS § 656–1 and is substantially the same as the original English Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="indent">The first English Statute was enacted almost 300 years ago to prevent “many fraudulent practices, which are commonly endeavored to be upheld by perjury and subornation of perjury.” 29 Car. 2, c. 3 (1677). Certainly, there were compelling reasons in those days for such a law. At the time of enactment in England, the jury system was quite unreliable, rules of evidence were few, and the complaining party was disqualified as a witness so he could neither testify on direct-examination nor, more importantly, be cross-examined. The aforementioned structural and evidentiary limitations on our system of justice no longer exist.</p>
<p class="indent">Retention of the Statute today has nevertheless been justified on at least three grounds: (1) the Statute still serves an evidentiary function thereby lessening the danger of perjured testimony (the original rationale); (2) the requirement of a writing has a cautionary effect which causes reflection by the parties on the importance of the agreement; and (3) the writing is an easy way to distinguish enforceable contracts from those which are not, thus channelling certain transactions into written form.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of whatever utility the Statute of Frauds may still have, its applicability has been drastically limited by judicial construction over the years in order to mitigate the harshness of a mechanical application.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_125" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-125" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> Furthermore, learned writers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page595" class="pagebreak">595</span>continue to disparage the Statute regarding it as “a statute for promoting fraud” and a “legal anachronism.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another method of judicial circumvention of the Statute of Frauds has grown out of the exercise of the equity powers of the courts. Such judicially imposed limitations or exceptions involved the traditional dispensing power of the equity courts to mitigate the “harsh” rule of law. When courts have enforced an oral contract in spite of the Statute, they have utilized the legal labels of “part performance” or “equitable estoppel” in granting relief. Both doctrines are said to be based on the concept of estoppel, which operates to avoid unconscionable injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Part performance has long been recognized in Hawaii as an equitable doctrine justifying the enforcement of an oral agreement for the conveyance of an interest in land where there has been substantial reliance by the party seeking to enforce the contract….</p>
<p class="indent">It is appropriate for modern courts to cast aside the raiments of conceptualism which cloak the true policies underlying the reasoning behind the many decisions enforcing contracts that violate the Statute of Frauds. There is certainly no need to resort to legal rubrics or meticulous legal formulas when better explanations are available. The policy behind enforcing an oral agreement which violated the Statute of Frauds, as a policy of avoiding unconscionable injury, was well set out by the California Supreme Court. In <span class="italic">Monarco v. LoGreco</span>, a case which involved an action to enforce an oral contract for the conveyance of land on the grounds of 20 years performance by the promisee, the court said:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The doctrine of estoppel to assert the statute of frauds has been consistently applied by the courts of this state to prevent fraud that would result from refusal to enforce oral contracts in certain circumstances. Such fraud may inhere in the unconscionable injury that would result from denying enforcement of the contract after one party has been induced by the other seriously to change his position in reliance on the contract * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">In seeking to frame a workable test which is flexible enough to cover diverse factual situations and also provide some reviewable standards, we find very persuasive section [139] of the [Second] Restatement of Contracts. That section specifically covers those situations where there has been reliance on an oral contract which falls within the Statute of Frauds. Section [139] states:</p>
<p class="list">(1) A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce the action or forbearance is enforceable notwithstanding the Statute <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page596" class="pagebreak">596</span>of Frauds if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach is to be limited as justice requires.</p>
<p class="list">(2) In determining whether injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise, the following circumstances are significant: (a) the availability and adequacy of other remedies, particularly cancellation and restitution; (b) the definite and substantial character of the action or forbearance in relation to the remedy sought; (c) the extent to which the action or forbearance corroborates evidence of the making and terms of the promise, or the making and terms are otherwise established by clear and convincing evidence; (d) the reasonableness of the action or forbearance; (e) the extent to which the action or forbearance was foreseeable by the promisor.</p>
<p class="indent">We think that the approach taken in the Restatement is the proper method of giving the trial court the necessary latitude to relieve a party of the hardships of the Statute of Frauds. Other courts have used similar approaches in dealing with oral employment contracts upon which an employee had seriously relied. This is to be preferred over having the trial court bend over backwards to take the contract out of the Statute of Frauds. In the present case the trial court admitted just this inclination and forthrightly followed it.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no dispute that the action of the plaintiff in moving 2200 miles from Los Angeles to Hawaii was foreseeable by the defendant. In fact, it was required to perform his duties. Injustice can only be avoided by the enforcement of the contract and the granting of money damages. No other remedy is adequate. The plaintiff found himself residing in Hawaii without a job.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also clear that a contract of some kind did exist. The plaintiff performed the contract for two and one-half months receiving $3,484.60 for his services. The exact length of the contract, whether terminable at will as urged by the defendant, or for a year from the time when the plaintiff started working, was up to the jury to decide.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the trial court might have found that enforcement of the contract was warranted by virtue of the plaintiff’s reliance on the defendant’s promise. Naturally, each case turns on its own facts. Certainly there is considerable discretion for a court to implement the true policy behind the Statute of Frauds, which is to prevent fraud or any other type of unconscionable injury. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the plaintiff’s reliance was such that injustice could only be avoided by enforcement of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ A<small>BE</small>, J., with whom K<small>OBAYASHI</small>, J., joins, dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of the court has affirmed the judgment of the trial court; however, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page597" class="pagebreak">597</div>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I.</span></p>
<p class="indent">As acknowledged by this court, the trial judge erred when as a matter of law he ruled that the alleged employment contract did not come within the Statute of Frauds; however, I cannot agree that this error was not prejudicial as this court intimates.</p>
<p class="indent">On this issue, the date that the alleged contract was entered into was all important and the date of acceptance of an offer by the plaintiff was a question of fact for the jury to decide. In other words, it was for the jury to determine when the alleged one-year employment contract was entered into and if the jury had found that the plaintiff had accepted the offer more than one day before plaintiff was to report to work, the contract would have come within the Statute of Frauds and would have been unenforceable.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II.</span></p>
<p class="indent">This court holds that though the alleged one-year employment contract came within the Statute of Frauds, nevertheless the judgment of the trial court is affirmed “on the ground that the plaintiff’s reliance was such that injustice could only be avoided by enforcement of the contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">I believe this court is begging the issue by its holding because to reach that conclusion, this court is ruling that the defendant agreed to hire the plaintiff under a one-year employment contract. The defendant has denied that the plaintiff was hired for a period of one year and has introduced into evidence testimony of witnesses that all hiring by the defendant in the past has been on a trial basis. The defendant also testified that he had hired the plaintiff on a trial basis.</p>
<p class="indent">Here on one hand the plaintiff claimed that he had a one-year employment contract; on the other hand, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff had not been hired for one year but on a trial basis for so long as his services were satisfactory. I believe the Statute of Frauds was enacted to avoid the consequences this court is forcing upon the defendant. In my opinion, the legislature enacted the Statute of Frauds to negate claims such as has been made by the plaintiff in this case. But this court holds that because the plaintiff in reliance of the one-year employment contract (alleged to have been entered into by the plaintiff, but denied by the defendant) has changed his position, “injustice could only be avoided by enforcement of the contract.” Where is the sense of justice?</p>
<p class="indent">Now assuming that the defendant had agreed to hire the plaintiff under a one-year employment contract and the contract came within the Statute of Frauds, I cannot agree, as intimated by this court, that we should circumvent the Statute of Frauds by the exercise of the equity powers of courts. As to statutory law, the sole function of the judiciary is to interpret the statute and the judiciary should not usurp legislative power and enter into the legislative field. Thus, if the Statute of Frauds is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page598" class="pagebreak">598</span>too harsh as intimated by this court, and it brings about undue hardship, it is for the legislature to amend or repeal the statute and not for this court to legislate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Put yourself in Mr. McIntosh’s shoes. Would you move 2,200 miles on the basis of a one-year employment contract without having something in writing? Why didn’t McIntosh? Is it significant that McIntosh had arranged before any job offer had been made to arrive in Hawaii on April 26?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. If a reasonable person would expect a writing to evidence a one-year employment contract, isn’t McIntosh’s version of the agreement dubious?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. The jury awarded McIntosh $12,103.40, and we do not know exactly how it calculated that sum. It appears to be quite close to the unpaid salary for the unexpired term of the year-long contract. Section 90 of the Restatement, Second, Contracts recognizes that when enforcement of the promise is based on unbargained-for reliance, “the remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.” What is the value you would put on McIntosh’s reliance if you were a judge trying this case without a jury?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. In <span class="italic">Stearns v. Emery-Waterhouse Co.</span>, 596 A.2d 72 (Me. 1991), the court refused to apply the reliance based exception to the Statute of Frauds in a factual context similar to that in <span class="italic">McIntosh</span>. Stearns sued his former employer for breach of an oral agreement with the company’s president to employ him to age 55 at an annual salary of $85,000. Stearns asserted that in reliance on this oral agreement, he left his prior employment and moved from Massachusetts to Maine, where he served as Emery-Waterhouse’s director of retail sales for nearly two years. Stearns was then assigned a different job at a reduced salary of $68,000. Six months later, before he turned 55, Stearns was terminated. The court described the question before it as “whether an employee may avoid the statute of frauds based solely upon his detrimental reliance on an employer’s oral promise of continued employment.” The court answered no because: “[I]n the employment context [doing so] contravenes the policy of the Statute to prevent fraud. It is too easy for a disgruntled former employee to allege reliance on a promise, but difficult factually to distinguish such reliance from the ordinary preparations that attend any new employment. Thus, such pre-employment actions of reliance do not properly serve the evidentiary function of the writing required by the statute.”</p>

<p class="indent">Agreements that need not be written in order to qualify for enforceability are often written if they involve deals of any consequence. There are, of course, several practical advantages to putting an understanding into a writing to which both parties affix their signatures, even when a writing is not essential to the agreement’s enforceability. Reducing the agreement to writing will lead the parties to examine its terms and think through their bargain. A writing evidences the deal, thus reducing problems of proof at trial. It also evidences the deal to other people, such as bankers who may be asked to finance the transaction or lend money against the contract as collateral. And it limits reliance on memory and stale impressions and thus reduces—if it does not cut off—disagreement as to what was and what was not fully agreed upon at the conclusion of negotiations.</p>
<p class="indent">Putting the agreement in writing, however, has another effect–invoking the parol evidence rule. In contract litigation this effect is not always a desirable one. This “rule” is stated as follows in a leading treatise:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Parol evidence… may not be admitted into evidence to add to or contradict the clear and unambiguous terms of a written instrument that appears, on its face, to express an agreement that is complete in all of its essential terms, in an effort to show that, at or before the signing of the document, some further or different terms were orally agreed upon by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">28 Williston, Contracts § 70:135 at 12 (4<sup>th</sup> ed. 2003) (Richard A. Lord, ed.)</p>
<p class="indent">The idea behind the parol evidence rule so defined is commonsensical enough—if the writing is the whole contract, then it is impermissible to contradict its terms by looking outside the contract. This tight definition also contains the basis for the four major exceptions that limit the application of the rule. First, the rule is only applied to an “integrated” contract: it is always open to a party to attempt to prove by any relevant evidence that the contract is not complete. Second, while outside evidence is not permitted for certain purposes (Williston states in extreme form that the new evidence may not “add to or contradict” the terms of the agreement), the rule does not eliminate the need to interpret the agreement and give contextual meaning to its admitted terms.</p>
<p class="indent">The third and fourth exceptions, which are derived from a close reading of the rule, may be considered subsets of the first exception but are worthy of explicit mention. The third exception applies to all evidence of <span class="italic">subsequent</span> agreements—conversations, writings and conduct of the parties. The rule limits the applicability of only <span class="italic">prior</span> and <span class="italic">contemporaneous</span> evidence of agreements. Fourth, the rule only proscribes evidence of contemporaneous <span class="italic">oral</span> agreements; evidence of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page600" class="pagebreak">600</span>contemporaneous <span class="italic">written</span> agreements and collateral deals, therefore, are still permissible under the rule.</p>
<p class="indent">Collectively these limitations on the rule have the capacity to swallow it up whole. Since completeness in a writing is almost impossible to achieve, the application of the rule causes big problems to judges and lawyers alike. The result is about what one would expect: judicial application of the rule ranges from very arbitrary to very relaxed.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the major significance of the parol evidence rule is to allocate decision-making authority among the official participants in the court process. In the rare case tried before a jury, the rule determines whether the jury will hear the disputed evidence. It all boils down to a question of how much of the story the parties will be permitted to tell to the jury at trial.</p>
<p class="indent">In cases decided by the judge alone, the rule doesn’t have this effect because the judge must hear the evidence in order to decide whether to admit it as proof. But in the case of a bench trial the rule alters the balance of authority between the trial judge and a reviewing appellate court in deciding what the terms of the contract mean. The same issue may be stated in a somewhat different way by asking whether the interpretation of a written contract is a matter of fact (to be decided by the trier of fact, a judge or jury) or is a matter of law (to be decided by the trier of law, either the trial judge or a reviewing appeals court). As Restatement, Second, Contracts § 212(2) and Comment d indicate:</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 212. Interpretation of Integrated Agreement.</span></h4>
<p class="list_alpha">(1) The interpretation of an integrated agreement is directed to the meaning of the terms of the writing or writings in the light of the circumstances, in accordance with the rules stated in this Chapter.</p>
<p class="list_alpha">(2) A question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined by the trier of fact if it depends on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or on a choice among reasonable inferences to be drawn from extrinsic evidence. Otherwise a question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined as a question of law.</p>
<p class="list_alphap">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="list_alpha2"><span class="italic">d. “Question of Law.”</span> Analytically, what meaning is attached to a word or other symbol by one or more people is a question of fact. But general usage as to the meaning of words in the English language is commonly a proper subject for judicial notice without the aid of evidence extrinsic to the writing. Historically, moreover, partly perhaps because of the fact that jurors were often illiterate, questions of interpretation of written documents have been treated as questions of law in the sense that they are decided by the trial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page601" class="pagebreak">601</span>judge rather than by the jury. Likewise, since an appellate court is commonly in as good a position to decide such questions as the trial judge, they have been treated as questions of law for purposes of appellate review. Such treatment has the effect of limiting the power of the trier of fact to exercise a dispensing power in the guise of a finding of fact, and thus contributes to the stability and predictability of contractual relations. In cases of standardized contracts such as insurance policies, it also provides a method of assuring that like cases will be decided alike.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Understood in this way, the parol evidence rule has a political significance. Its popularity in rigid form during the 19th and early 20th centuries can be interpreted as an institutional preference for the resolution of contract disputes by judges, and particularly by appellate judges. Its softening during the 20th century can be understood as indicating a greater willingness to permit lay jurors to play a determinative role in interpreting the obligations created by written contracts. As appellate judges have sought to assert more control over the resolution of disputes based on written contracts, the rule has to some degree increased in significance more recently, although it is still a rare case in which application of the parol evidence rule is casedispositive.</p>
<p class="indent">Most legal scholars agree that the true rule is one of very limited application, and properly so if full effect is to be given to the principle that parties should be bound only as they actually agreed. At the same time, there is strong pressure—particularly in an economy in which written promises are used as an important source for obtaining credit and hence must be relied on by those who are strangers to it—to limit the effect of a contract to the terms found in the document alone. Trial courts generally recognize that the rule (when broadly applied) is a very handy tool for shortening trials by quickly eliminating a lot of evidence that the judge feels is highly improbable anyway. Hence, understanding how to use the parol evidence rule both as sword and as shield is of great importance to the drafting and the litigating lawyer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Parol Evidence Admissible for Purposes of Interpretation.</span> No parol evidence that is offered can be said to vary or contradict a writing until by process of interpretation the meaning of the writing is determined. The “parol evidence rule” is not, and does not purport to be, a rule of interpretation or a rule as to the admission of evidence for the purpose of interpretation. Even if a written document has been <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page602" class="pagebreak">602</span>assented to as the complete and accurate integration of the terms of a contract, it must still be interpreted and all those factors that are of assistance in this process may be proved by oral testimony.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that the language of some agreements has been believed to be so plain and clear that the court needs no assistance in interpretation. Even in these cases, however, the courts seem to have had the aid of parol evidence of surrounding circumstances. The meaning to be discovered and applied is that which each party had reason to know would be given to the words by the other party. Antecedent and surrounding factors that throw light upon this question may be proved by any kind of relevant evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The more bizarre and unusual an asserted interpretation is, the more convincing must be the testimony that supports it. At what point the court should cease listening to testimony that white is black and that a dollar is fifty cents is a matter for sound judicial discretion and common sense. Even these things may be true for some purposes. As long as the court is aware that there may be doubt and ambiguity and uncertainty in the meaning and application of agreed language, it will welcome testimony as to antecedent agreements, communications, and other factors that may help to decide the issue. Such testimony does not vary or contradict the written words; it determines that which cannot afterwards be varied or contradicted.</p>

<p id="sec285" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Lee v. Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 1977.</p>
<p class="sectionb">552 F.2d 447.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ G<small>URFEIN</small>, J. This is an appeal by defendant Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc. (“Seagram”) from a judgment entered by the District Court, Hon. Charles H. Tenney, upon the verdict of a jury in the amount of $407,850 in favor of the plaintiffs on a claim asserting common law breach of an oral contract….</p>
<p class="indent">The jury could have found the following. The Lees owned a 50% interest in Capitol City Liquor Company, Inc. (“Capitol City”), a wholesale liquor distributorship located in Washington, D.C. The other 50% was owned by Harold’s brother, Henry D. Lee, and his nephew, Arthur Lee. Seagram is a distiller of alcoholic beverages. Capitol City carried numerous Seagram brands and a large portion of its sales were generated by Seagram lines.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lees and the other owners of Capitol City wanted to sell their respective interests in the business and, in May 1970, Harold Lee, the father, discussed the possible sale of Capitol City with Jack Yogman (“Yogman”), then Executive Vice President of Seagram (and now President), whom he had known for many years. Lee <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page603" class="pagebreak">603</span>offered to sell Capitol City to Seagram but conditioned the offer on Seagram’s agreement to relocate Harold and his sons, the 50% owners of Capitol City, in a new distributorship of their own in a different city.</p>
<p class="indent">About a month later, another officer of Seagram, John Barth, an assistant to Yogman, visited the Lees and their co-owners in Washington and began negotiations for the purchase of the assets of Capitol City by Seagram on behalf of a new distributor, one Carter, who would take it over after the purchase. The purchase of the assets of Capitol City was consummated on September 30, 1970 pursuant to a written agreement. The promise to relocate the father and sons thereafter was not reduced to writing.</p>
<p class="indent">Harold Lee had served the Seagram organization for thirty-six years in positions of responsibility before he acquired the half interest in the Capitol City Distributorship. From 1958 to 1962, he was chief executive officer of Calvert Distillers Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary. During this long period he enjoyed the friendship and confidence of the principals of Seagram.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1958, Harold Lee had purchased from Seagram its holdings of Capitol City stock in order to introduce his sons into the liquor distribution business, and also to satisfy Seagram’s desire to have a strong and friendly distributor for Seagram products in Washington, D.C. Harold Lee and Yogman had known each other for 13 years.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs claimed a breach of the oral agreement to relocate Harold Lee’s sons, alleging that Seagram had had opportunities to procure another distributorship for the Lees but had refused to do so. The Lees brought this action on January 18, 1972, fifteen months after the sale of the Capitol City distributorship to Seagram. They contended that they had performed their obligation by agreeing to the sale by Capitol City of its assets to Seagram, but that Seagram had failed to perform its obligation under the separate oral contract between the Lees and Seagram. The agreement which the trial court permitted the jury to find was “an oral agreement with defendant which provided that if they agreed to sell their interest in Capitol City, defendant in return, within a reasonable time, would provide the plaintiffs a Seagram distributorship whose price would require roughly an amount equal to the capital obtained by the plaintiffs for the sale of their interest in Capitol City, and which distributorship would be in a location acceptable to plaintiffs.” No specific exception was taken to this portion of the charge. By its verdict for the plaintiffs, we must assume—as Seagram notes in its brief—that this is the agreement which the jury found was made before the sale of Capitol City was agreed upon.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant urges several grounds for reversal. It contends that, as a matter of law, (1) plaintiffs’ proof of the alleged oral agreement is barred by the parol evidence <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page604" class="pagebreak">604</span>rule; and (2) the oral agreement is too vague and indefinite to be enforceable. Appellant also contends that plaintiffs’ proof of damages is speculative and incompetent.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The District Court, in its denial of the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, treated the issue as whether the written agreement for the sale of assets was an “integrated” agreement not only of all the mutual agreements concerning the sale of Capitol City assets, but also of <span class="italic">all</span> the mutual agreements of the parties. Finding the language of the sales agreement “somewhat ambiguous,” the court decided that the determination of whether the parol evidence rule applies must await the taking of evidence on the issue of whether the sales agreement was intended to be a complete and accurate integration of all of the mutual promises of the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">Seagram did not avail itself of this invitation. It failed to call as witnesses any of the three persons who negotiated the sales agreement on behalf of Seagram regarding the intention of the parties to integrate all mutual promises or regarding the failure of the written agreement to contain an integration clause.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant contends that, as a matter of law, the oral agreement was “part and parcel” of the subject-matter of the sales contract and that failure to include it in the written contract barred proof of its existence. The position of appellant, fairly stated, is that the oral agreement was either an inducing cause for the sale or was a part of the consideration for the sale, and in either case, should have been contained in the written contract. In either case, it argues that the parol evidence rule bars its admission.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees maintain, on the other hand, that the oral agreement was a collateral agreement and that, since it is not contradictory of any of the terms of the sales agreement, proof of it is not barred by the parol evidence rule. Because the case comes to us after a jury verdict we must assume that there actually was an oral contract, such as the court instructed the jury it could find. The question is whether the strong policy for avoiding fraudulent claims through application of the parol evidence rule nevertheless mandates reversal on the ground that the jury should not have been permitted to hear the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The District Court stated the cardinal issue to be whether the parties “intended” the written agreement for the sale of assets to be the complete and accurate integration of all the mutual promises of the parties. If the written contract was not a complete integration, the court held, then the parol evidence rule has no application….</p>
<p class="indent">The law of New York is not rigid or categorical, but is in harmony with this approach. As Judge Fuld said in <span class="italic">Fogelson:</span> “Decision in each case must, of course, turn <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page605" class="pagebreak">605</span>upon the type of transaction involved, the scope of the written contract and the content of the oral agreement asserted.” 300 N.Y. at 338. And the Court of Appeals wrote in <span class="italic">Ball v. Grady</span>, 267 N.Y. 470, 472 (1935): “In the end, the court must find the limits of the integration as best it may be reading the writing in the light of surrounding circumstances.”</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, certain oral collateral agreements, even though made contemporaneously, are not within the prohibition of the parol evidence rule “because they are separate, independent, and complete contracts, although relating to the same subject. * * * [T]hey are allowed to be proved by parol, because they were made by parol, and no part thereof committed to writing.”</p>
<p class="indent">Although there is New York authority which in general terms supports defendant’s thesis that an oral contract inducing a written one or varying the consideration may be barred, the overarching question is whether, in the context of the particular setting, the oral agreement was one which the parties would ordinarily be expected to embody in the writing. For example, integration is most easily inferred in the case of real estate contracts for the sale of land. In more complex situations, in which customary business practice may be more varied, an oral agreement can be treated as separate and independent of the written agreement even though the written contract contains a strong integration clause.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, as we see it, the issue is whether the oral promise to the plaintiffs, as individuals, would be an expectable term of the contract for the sale of assets by a corporation in which plaintiffs have only a 50% interest, considering as well the history of their relationship to Seagram.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, there are several reasons why it would <span class="italic">not</span> be expected that the oral agreement to give Harold Lee’s sons another distributorship would be integrated into the sales contract. In the usual case, there is an identity of parties in both the claimed integrated instrument and in the oral agreement asserted. Here, although it would have been physically possible to insert a provision dealing with only the shareholders of a 50% interest, the transaction itself was a <span class="italic">corporate</span> sale of assets. Collateral agreements which survive the closing of a corporate deal, such as employment agreements for particular shareholders of the seller or consulting agreements, are often set forth in separate agreements. It was expectable that such an agreement as one to obtain a new distributorship for certain persons, some of whom were not even parties to the contract, would not necessarily be integrated into an instrument for the sale of <span class="italic">corporate</span> assets. As with an oral condition precedent to the legal effectiveness of an otherwise integrated written contract, which is not barred by the parol evidence rule if it is not directly contradictory of its terms.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, it is significant that there was a close relationship of confidence and friendship over many years between two old men, Harold Lee and Yogman, whose authority to bind Seagram has not been questioned. It would not be surprising that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page606" class="pagebreak">606</span>a handshake for the benefit of Harold’s sons would have been thought sufficient. In point, as well, is the circumstance that the negotiations concerning the provisions of the sales agreement were not conducted by Yogman but by three other Seagram representatives, headed by John Barth. The two transactions may not have been integrated in their minds when the contract was drafted.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the written agreement does not contain the customary integration clause, even though a good part of it (relating to warranties and negative covenants) is boilerplate. The omission may, of course, have been caused by mutual trust and confidence, but in any event, there is no such strong presumption of exclusion because of the existence of a detailed integration clause, as was relied upon by the Court of Appeals in <span class="italic">Fogelson, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor do we see any contradiction of the terms of the sales agreement. The written agreement dealt with the sale of corporate assets, the oral agreement with the relocation of the Lees. Thus, the oral agreement does not vary or contradict the money consideration recited in the contract as flowing to the selling corporation. That is the only consideration recited, and it is still the only consideration to the corporation.</p>
<p class="indent">We affirm Judge Tenney’s reception in evidence of the oral agreement and his denial of the motion under Rule 50(b) with respect to the parol evidence rule.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Appellant contends, however, that the jury verdict cannot stand because the oral agreement was so vague and indefinite as to be unenforceable. First, appellant argues that the failure to specify purchase price, profitability or sales volume of the distributorship to be provided, is fatal to the contract’s validity. The contention is that, because the oral agreement lacks essential terms, the courts cannot determine the rights and obligations of the parties. Second, appellant contends that the agreement is unenforceable because there were no specific limits to plaintiffs’ discretion in deciding whether to accept or reject a particular distributorship; and hence the agreement was illusory.</p>
<p class="indent">The alleged agreement, as the jury was permitted to find, was to provide the Lees with a liquor distributorship of approximately half the value and profit potential of Capitol City, within a reasonable time. The distributorship would be “in a location acceptable to plaintiffs,” and the price would require roughly an amount equal to the plaintiffs’ previous investment in Capitol City. The performance by plaintiffs in agreeing to the sale of Capitol City caused the counter-performance of the oral promise to mature.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the nature of the agreement found by the jury is recognized, it becomes clear that appellant’s contentions are without merit. As for the alleged lack of essential terms, there was evidence credited by the jury, which <span class="italic">did</span> establish the purchase <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page607" class="pagebreak">607</span>price, profitability and sales volume of the distributorship with reasonable specificity. In addition to the direct testimony of the Lees, there was evidence that distributorships were valued, as a rule of thumb, at book value plus three times the previous year’s net profit after taxes. Between this industry standard and the reference to the Capitol City transaction, there was extrinsic evidence to render the parties’ obligations reasonably definite. Professor Corbin has observed that a court should be slow to deny enforcement “if it is convinced that the parties themselves meant to make a ‘contract’ and to bind themselves to render a future performance. Many a gap in terms can be filled, and should be, with a result that is consistent with what the parties said and that is more just to both of them than would be a refusal of enforcement.” Corbin on Contracts § 97, at 425–26. New York courts are in accord in hesitating to find that a contract is too indefinite for enforcement. The requirement that the alleged oral agreement be performed within a reasonable time is particularly unobjectionable, especially in light of the fact, which Seagram knew, that plaintiffs would have to reinvest the proceeds from the sale of Capitol City within one year or suffer adverse tax consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">As for the alleged unbridled discretion which the oral agreement conferred on the plaintiffs, we similarly conclude that there is no fatal defect. We note at the outset that the requirement that the new distributorship be “acceptable” to the Lees did not render the agreement illusory in the sense that it is not supported by consideration; the Lee’s part of the bargain was to join in the sale of Capitol City’s assets and assignment of its franchise, which they had already performed. More importantly, we do not agree that the Lees had “unbridled” discretion. New York courts would in all events impose an obligation of good faith on the Lees’ exercise of discretion, <span class="italic">see e.g., Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff–Gordon</span>, and there was also extrinsic evidence of what would constitute an “acceptable distributorship,” and hence constitute reasonable performance by Seagram. Seagram appears to contend that if it <span class="italic">had</span> tendered reasonable performance, by offering an acceptable distributorship to the Lees, that the Lees nevertheless could have found it not “acceptable.” This is not correct. It is true that Seagram could not have forced the Lees to <span class="italic">take</span> a distributorship, because they had not promised to do so. But Seagram’s tender of reasonable performance would discharge its obligations under the oral agreement, whether or not the Lees “accepted.” The Lees could not prevent Seagram from fulfilling its obligations by unreasonably refusing an acceptable distributorship. Since the obligations of the parties under the contract therefore were ascertainable, it was not void for indefiniteness.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">The jury awarded the two sons and the estate of the father damages in the amount of $407,850. The essence of the court’s charge on the subject was that in a contract action the basic principle of damages “is to indemnify a plaintiff for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page608" class="pagebreak">608</span>gains prevented and the losses sustained by a defendant’s breach, to leave him no worse but in no better position than he would have been had the breach not occurred.” The court charged that the jury was to determine the reasonable value of the injury, if any. It charged further that “from the sum thus arrived at, you will then deduct such amount, if any, as from the evidence you find fairly measures the benefit to plaintiffs resulting from the fact that plaintiffs were freed to engage their services and capital in other situations during the time they would otherwise have been engaged in the management of an investment in the alleged promised distributorship.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs introduced testimony by Ernest L. Sommers, a certified public accountant, whom the District Court found to be qualified as an expert. Sommers compared one-half of the profits of Capitol City in its <span class="italic">last</span> fiscal year ending June 1, 1970 on the theory that profits for the past five years showed an upward trend, with the amount earned on investments in bonds by the plaintiffs in the year succeeding the sale. He found that one-half of the Capitol City pre-tax profits, based on one-half the sales price, amounted to 14.508%. The return on the bond investment was 7.977%. He then subtracted the percentage return on the investment bonds from the percentage return of the Capitol City operation, which gave him a percentage figure for the loss occasioned by the breach, of 6.531%. This figure, applied to one-half the sales price, came to $83,800 per annum before taxes. Multiplying this figure by only ten years—an assumed minimum measure for the life of the “new” distributorship—would make an $838,000 total loss. Discounting to present value, the witness reduced the figure to $549,000. The jury returned a verdict, as we have seen, for a lesser amount, $407,850. There is, therefore, no element of damage in the verdict amount for which no evidence was submitted to the jury. Appellant contends, however, that plaintiffs’ proof of damages was speculative and incompetent.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellant’s position is based in large measure on some confusion about the precise nature of the agreement found by the jury. Plaintiffs’ evidence bore directly on the damages sustained by breach of a contract to provide a distributorship of one-half the cost and worth of Capitol City, and on the “fair measure” of the sums properly deducted. Appellant’s contention that plaintiffs should have been required to prove, as a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> to any damage award, that there was a Seagram distributor actually willing to sell his distributorship to them, is without merit. The oral agreement, as the jury was permitted to find, was for Seagram to <span class="italic">provide</span> a distributorship for the Lees. The jury was permitted to find that Seagram could have fulfilled this obligation by steering a voluntary sale of a distributorship to the plaintiffs or could have financed an intermediate transaction, warehousing the acquired distributorship for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="indent">Seagram contends that lost profits are not the proper measure of damages for breach of contract, and that cases allowing damages for destruction of injury to an ongoing business are not controlling. Lost profits can, however, be a proper measure <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page609" class="pagebreak">609</span>of damages for breach of contract. As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit said in <span class="italic">Standard Machinery Co. v. Duncan Shaw Corp.</span>, 208 F.2d 61, 64:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Certainly no authority need be cited for the broad proposition that prospective profits, if proved, are an element of a plaintiff’s damages for breach of contract, or for the further proposition that evidence of past profits from an established business provides a reasonable basis for estimating future profits from the business.</p>
<p class="indent">This is so even if the prospective business has not yet begun operation.</p>
<p class="indent">Seagram objects to the fact that plaintiffs’ proof concerned the profit experience of Capitol City. It suggests that the best way of determining profits would be to consider the profits of an existing distributorship. But it came forward with no such proof, presumably for tactical reasons. We hold that the method of proof used by the plaintiffs was adequate in the circumstances. Since Seagram’s breach has made difficult a more precise proof of damages, it must bear the risk of uncertainty created by its conduct….</p>

<p class="sectionb">California Supreme Court, 1968.</p>
<p class="sectionb">69 Cal.2d 33, 442 P.2d 641, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ T<small>RAYNOR</small>, C.J. Defendant appeals from a judgment for plaintiff in an action for damages for injury to property under an indemnity clause of a contract.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1960 defendant entered into a contract with plaintiff to furnish the labor and equipment necessary to remove and replace the upper metal cover of plaintiff’s steam turbine. Defendant agreed to perform the work “at [its] own risk and expense” and to “indemnify” plaintiff “against all loss, damage, expense and liability resulting from * * * injury to property, arising out of or in any way connected with the performance of this contract.” Defendant also agreed to procure not less than $50,000 insurance to cover liability for injury to property. Plaintiff was to be an additional named insured, but the policy was to contain a cross-liability clause extending the coverage to plaintiff’s property.</p>
<p class="indent">During the work the cover fell and injured the exposed rotor of the turbine. Plaintiff brought this action to recover $25,144.51, the amount it subsequently spent on repairs. During the trial it dismissed a count based on negligence and thereafter <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page610" class="pagebreak">610</span>secured judgment on the theory that the indemnity provision covered injury to all property regardless of ownership.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendant offered to prove by admissions of plaintiff’s agents, by defendant’s conduct under similar contracts entered into with plaintiff, and by other proof that in the indemnity clause the parties meant to cover injury to property of third parties only and not to plaintiff’s property. Although the trial court observed that the language used was “the classic language for a third party indemnity provision” and that “one could very easily conclude that * * * its whole intendment is to indemnify third parties,” it nevertheless held that the “plain language” of the agreement also required defendant to indemnify plaintiff for injuries to plaintiff’s property. Having determined that the contract had a plain meaning, the court refused to admit any extrinsic evidence that would contradict its interpretation.</p>
<p class="indent">When the court interprets a contract on this basis, it determines the meaning of the instrument in accordance with the “* * * extrinsic evidence of the judge’s own linguistic education and experience.” (3 Corbin on Contracts (1960 ed.) [1964 Supp. § 579].) The exclusion of testimony that might contradict the linguistic background of the judge reflects a judicial belief in the possibility of perfect verbal expression. This belief is a remnant of a primitive faith in the inherent potency<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_127" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-127" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></sup> and inherent meaning of words.</p>
<p class="indent">The test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face, but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.</p>
<p class="indent">A rule that would limit the determination of the meaning of a written instrument to its four-corners merely because it seems to the court to be clear and unambiguous, would either deny the relevance of the intention of the parties or presuppose a degree of verbal precision and stability our language has not attained.</p>
<p class="indent">Some courts have expressed the opinion that contractual obligations are created by the mere use of certain words, whether or not there was any intention to incur <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page611" class="pagebreak">611</span>such obligations.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_128" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-128" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> Under this view, contractual obligations flow, not from the intention of the parties but from the fact that they used certain magic words. Evidence of the parties’ intention therefore becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p class="indent">In this state, however, the intention of the parties as expressed in the contract is the source of contractual rights and duties.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_129" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-129" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></sup> A court must ascertain and give effect to this intention by determining what the parties meant by the words they used. Accordingly, the exclusion of relevant, extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument could be justified only if it were feasible to determine the meaning the parties gave to the words from the instrument alone.</p>
<p class="indent">If words had absolute and constant referents, it might be possible to discover contractual intention in the words themselves and in the manner in which they were arranged. Words, however, do not have absolute and constant referents. “A word is a symbol of thought but has no arbitrary and fixed meaning like a symbol of algebra or chemistry, * * *.” (<span class="italic">Pearson v. State Social Welfare Board</span> (1960)). The meaning of particular words or groups of words varies with the “* * * verbal context and surrounding circumstances and purposes in view of the linguistic education and experience of their users, and their hearers or readers (not excluding judges). * * * A word has no meaning apart from these factors; much less does it have an objective meaning, one true meaning.” (Corbin, <span class="italic">The Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule</span> (1965) 50 Cornell L.Q. 161, 187.) Accordingly, the meaning of a writing “* * * can only be found by interpretation in the light of all the circumstances that reveal the sense in which the writer used the words. The exclusion of parol evidence regarding such circumstances merely because the words do not appear ambiguous to the reader can easily lead to the attribution to a written instrument of a meaning that was never intended.”</p>
<p class="indent">Although extrinsic evidence is not admissible to add to, detract from, or vary the terms of a written contract, these terms must first be determined before it can be decided whether or not extrinsic evidence is being offered for a prohibited purpose. The fact that the terms of an instrument appear clear to a judge does not preclude the possibility that the parties chose the language of the instrument to express different terms. That possibility is not limited to contracts whose terms have acquired a particular meaning by trade usage, but exists whenever the parties’ understanding of the words used may have differed from the judge’s understanding.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page612" class="pagebreak">612</div>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, rational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_130" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-130" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></sup> Such evidence includes testimony as to the “circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement * * * including the object, nature and subject matter of the writing * * *” so that the court can “place itself in the same situation in which the parties found themselves at the time of contracting.” If the court decides, after considering this evidence, that the language of a contract, in the light of all the circumstances, “is fairly susceptible of either one of the two interpretations contended for * * *” extrinsic evidence relevant to prove either of such meanings is admissible.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_131" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-131" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the present case the court erroneously refused to consider extrinsic evidence offered to show that the indemnity clause in the contract was not intended to cover injuries to plaintiff’s property. Although that evidence was not necessary to show that the indemnity clause was reasonably susceptible of the meaning contended for by defendant, it was nevertheless relevant and admissible on that issue. Moreover, since that clause was reasonably susceptible of that meaning, the offered evidence was also admissible to prove that the clause had that meaning and did not cover injuries to plaintiff’s property.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_132" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-132" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup> Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed.</p>

<p id="sec290" class="sectiona"><span class="bold">Eskimo Pie Corp. v. Whitelawn Dairies</span></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States District Court, S.D. New York, 1968.</p>
<p class="sectionb">284 F.Supp. 987.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ M<small>ANSFIELD</small>, D.J.</p>
<p class="indent">The actions arise out of written contracts between Eskimo Pie Corporation (“Eskimo” herein), Whitelawn Dairies, Inc. (“Whitelawn” herein) and Supermarket Advisory Sales, Inc. (“SAS” herein) (Whitelawn and SAS are collectively referred to herein as “Whitelawn–SAS”) entered into on or about December 30, 1960, and modified in various respects in 1961 and 1962. These contracts are referred to by the parties as the “Package Deal.” All parties agree that the Package Deal is an integrated agreement setting forth in several writings all of the essential terms agreed upon by Eskimo and Whitelawn–SAS. Under the terms of the Package Deal Eskimo granted to Whitelawn, an ice cream manufacturer, the right to manufacture certain ice cream products bearing “Eskimo” wrappers and labels and to SAS the right to purchase such Eskimo-branded products from Eskimo or an Eskimo-authorized manufacturer for sale in the New York City Metropolitan Area as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">During the term of this Agreement [SAS] shall have the <span class="italic">non-exclusive</span> right to purchase the Eskimo stock and stickless products listed in Exhibit A hereto, which may be amended from time to time by addition or deletion, from Eskimo or from a manufacturer authorized by Eskimo to manufacture such products within the New York City metropolitan area * * *. (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="indent">The present lawsuits were instituted after Eskimo, beginning sometime in 1962 and 1963, sold its Eskimo-branded products to others in the New York City Metropolitan Area, and entered into agreements with M.H. Renken Dairy Co. (“Renken” herein) to manufacture, and with Food Enterprises, Inc. (“Food Enterprises” herein) to sell, such products, and assisted Harry L. Darnstaedt and Imperial Ice Cream Novelties, Inc. (“Imperial” herein) in selling such products in the New York City Metropolitan Area. This led to a deterioration in the relationship between the parties to the Package Deal; a purported termination by Whitelawn and SAS of purchases and sales thereunder; and mutual claims of breach of contract, since Whitelawn and SAS appear to have refused to accept and pay for certain products.</p>
<p class="indent">A threshold question, which appears to be central to the entire dispute between the parties, arises out of the meaning of the word “non-exclusive” as used in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page615" class="pagebreak">615</span>above quotation from the Package Deal, and the proposal of Whitelawn–SAS to offer parol evidence with respect to its meaning. Whitelawn and SAS contend that the word “non-exclusive” as used in the Package Deal meant that Eskimo would have the right to continue existing licenses granted by it to others in the New York City Metropolitan Area and to grant new licenses to national companies (such as the Borden Company, National Dairy Products Corporation), but not to grant licenses to so-called “independent” companies unless required to do so by order of a court or governmental agency, and that Eskimo itself was not to compete with Whitelawn and SAS in the sale of Eskimo-branded ice cream products. Eskimo denies such contentions as to the meaning of the word “non-exclusive” and asserts that it plainly meant that Eskimo was granting a bare non-exclusive right to Whitelawn and SAS to manufacture and sell Eskimo products, while retaining the unfettered right to license others as it saw fit to manufacture and sell Eskimo-branded ice cream products.</p>
<p class="indent">Whitelawn–SAS proposes, upon the jury trial of the issues of liability raised by the two lawsuits, to introduce not only the written agreements constituting the Package Deal, but also parol and extrinsic evidence as to what the parties understood and intended the term “non-exclusive” to mean, including earlier drafts of the Package Deal, correspondence and conversations between the parties leading up to its execution, and subsequent conduct of the parties, including a letter written by Darnstaedt on February 12, 1963 stating that the parties “had a gentlemen’s agreement that Eskimo would not solicit any stick franchises in New York City except any of the national companies that Eskimo is serving around the country.” More specifically, Whitelawn–SAS would offer testimony of its lawyers and others who negotiated the Package Deal on its behalf to the effect that earlier drafts, including one submitted by an Eskimo official named Gunn (now deceased) contained a clause which would have obligated Eskimo not to license or franchise the Eskimo mark, or sell Eskimo-branded ice cream products, to anyone in the New York City Metropolitan Area other than existing licensees or national dairy organizations, unless Eskimo should be required to do so by court or governmental order; that thereafter Eskimo refused to sign an agreement containing the express clause because of a fear expressed by Eskimo’s counsel that the proposed clause might violate the federal antitrust laws; and that accordingly, after a series of conferences, the proposed clause was deleted on the understanding that its meaning would be deemed incorporated into the word “non-exclusive” used in the above-quoted license to Whitelawn–SAS.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Eskimo, if such parol evidence were admitted at the trial, would offer testimony of its officials contradicting that of the Whitelawn–SAS negotiators, it argues, that such evidence is barred by the parol evidence rule, and seeks preliminary rulings before trial is commenced.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page616" class="pagebreak">616</div>
<p class="indent">The question of whether parol evidence should be admitted at trial is one of law to be determined and ruled upon by the Court. Normally such rulings are made when the evidence is offered during trial, with the party offering the evidence, should objection be sustained, preserving his rights through an offer of proof out of the jury’s presence. In this case, however, Eskimo asserts that since the parol evidence to be offered is extensive (both parties agreeing that if the evidence is admitted several witnesses will be required to testify for at least a few days), Eskimo would be forced to engage in multiple and continuous objections to and/or motions to strike, testimony as to each of the numerous conversations between the negotiators, and proof of each item of correspondence, drafts, etc., with the result that even if the evidence should ultimately be excluded, Eskimo would be unduly prejudiced before the jury. This argument has much merit and is supported by those who follow the practice in such cases of holding a preliminary hearing for the purpose of ruling on the admissibility of such evidence. Whitelawn–SAS contends, however, that since the parol evidence should be admitted at trial, a preliminary hearing would result in needless waste and expense occasioned by duplication in testimony and proof. In view of these opposing contentions, consideration by the Court at this time of the applicable evidentiary principles seems appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">All parties agree that in this diversity suit the admissibility of the parol and extrinsic evidence to be offered by Whitelawn–SAS is governed by the law of the State of New York, where Whitelawn and SAS are incorporated and have their principal places of business, where Eskimo is authorized to do business, where the agreements involved were for the most part negotiated, and where they were to be performed.</p>
<p class="indent">Whitelawn–SAS argues that parol evidence should be admitted on the ground that the term “non-exclusive” is ambiguous, and that even if it in fact lacks ambiguity such evidence may be received to show that the parties gave the term special or particular meaning not to be gathered from the language by a reasonably intelligent person having knowledge of the custom, usage and surrounding circumstances. In support of their position, Whitelawn–SAS relies principally on § 2–202 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC” herein), Corbin on Contracts §§ 535, 536, 542, 543, 579 and decisions of the late respected Judge Frank.</p>
<p class="indent">The effective date of [New York’s UCC section 2–202] is September 27, 1964, which postdates the Package Deal….</p>
<p class="indent">In any event even if § 2–202 of the UCC were applicable to the written contract here at issue, much of the proof which Whitelawn–SAS would offer to show what the parties intended the word “non-exclusive” to mean would not be admissible. Section 2–202 limits the parties, in explaining the meaning of language in a written integrated contract, to proof of a “course of dealing,” “usage of the trade,” and a “course of performance.” None of these terms encompass testimony or other proof as to the subjective intent of the parties. The term “course of dealing” as defined in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page617" class="pagebreak">617</span>§ 1–205(1) refers to “previous conduct between the parties” indicating a common basis for interpreting expressions used by them. In short, proof of such conduct is limited to objective facts as distinguished from oral statements of agreement. Likewise the term “usage of trade” is defined in § 1–205(2) as</p>
<p class="blockquote">any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage are to be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a written trade code or similar writing the interpretation of the writing is for the court.</p>
<p class="indent">The comments of the drafters as well as those of independent commentators make it clear that “usage of the trade” refers to evidence of generalized industry practice or similar recognized custom, as distinguished from particular conversations or correspondence between the parties with respect to the terms of the agreement. The same general conclusions must be reached with respect to proof of a “course of performance.”</p>
<p class="indent">The courts of New York have never subscribed to the view that, in the absence of ambiguity, evidence as to the subjective intent of the parties may be substituted for the plain meaning that would otherwise be ascribed to the language of a written agreement by a reasonably intelligent person having knowledge of the surrounding circumstances, customs and usages. On the contrary, prior New York law adhered to time-honored objective standards to determine the meaning of language found in writings which represent as did the Package Deal here the final and complete integrated agreement reached by the parties. The cardinal principles forming the cornerstone of those standards are (1) that the meaning to be attributed to the language of such an instrument is that which a reasonably intelligent person acquainted with general usage, custom and the surrounding circumstances would attribute to it; and (2) that in the absence of ambiguity parol evidence will not be admitted to determine the meaning that is to be attributed to such language.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The question is as to the fair and reasonable meaning that may be given to the writing sued on. Written words may have more than one meaning. “The letter killeth but the spirit giveth life.” 2 Cor. 3:6. “Form should not prevail over substance and a sensible meaning of words should be sought.” Atwater &amp; Co. v. Panama R.R. Co., 246 N.Y. 519, 524. But plain meanings may not be changed by parol, and the courts will not make a new contract for the parties under the guise of interpreting the writing. “The fact that the parties intended their words to bear a certain meaning, would be immaterial were it not for the fact that the words either normally or locally might properly bear such meaning.” Williston on Contracts, § 613.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Heller v. Pope</span>, 250 N.Y. 132 (1928) (Pound, J.).</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page618" class="pagebreak">618</div>
<p class="indent">Thus the oral statements of the parties as to what they intended unambiguous language in an integrated document to mean are excluded by the parol evidence rule, because the very purpose and essence of the rule is to avoid fraud that might be perpetrated if testimony as to subjective intent could be substituted for the plain meaning, objectively interpreted in the light of surrounding circumstances, customs and usage. The effect of admitting such testimony in the absence of some showing of ambiguity would be to permit a party to substitute his view of his obligations for those clearly stated. Where—as in the present case—some of the negotiators of the written agreement have died or are unavailable, the door could be opened to fraud. Accordingly, the view of the New York courts has been that an objective standard is essential to maintain confidence in the written integrated agreement as the medium for conducting commercial relations.</p>
<p class="indent">The first question to be determined in the present case, therefore, is whether the term “non-exclusive” as used in the Package Deal is ambiguous, which must be decided by the Court. An “ambiguous” word or phrase is one capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business. In the absence of proof that the term “non-exclusive” could possibly have the meaning, among others, attributed to it by Whitelawn–SAS, parol evidence must be excluded.</p>
<p class="indent">Applying the foregoing principles, the word “non-exclusive” when used—as was the case here—in an integrated license agreement drafted by legal counsel, has an established legal meaning that is usually accepted in the absence of a qualifying context, custom, usage or similar surrounding circumstance. The term has repeatedly been defined as meaning that the licensee is granted a bare right to use the trademark or patent being licensed without any right to exclude others, including other licensees taking from the grantor, from utilizing the mark or invention involved….</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the meaning thus usually ascribed by the law to the term “non-exclusive” Whitelawn–SAS urge that here the legal draftsmen intended it to have a contrary meaning, i.e., that subject to certain detailed and specific exceptions (The Borden Company, National Dairy Products Corporation, existing licensees and existing written commitments to others), and except to the extent that Eskimo might be required to deviate therefrom by court or governmental order, the term meant “exclusive.” In a business world not noted for its economy of language (the Package Deal covers 70 typewritten pages, including amendments) no business reason, custom or usage is advanced for attaching such an elaborate and paradoxical meaning to the term “non-exclusive,” when legal counsel negotiating for both sides could easily have spelled out such specifics in comprehensible terms. Whitelawn–SAS’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page619" class="pagebreak">619</span>assertion that the term was used to conceal a detailed secret “gentlemen’s agreement” that was feared by Eskimo to violate the antitrust laws hardly comports with the word’s having a secondary meaning as a matter of generalized trade usage or custom. On the contrary, such evidence would indicate that the term, despite the definite and plain meaning usually attributed to it, was being used to express a particular, subjective meaning initially conceived by the parties solely for the purpose at hand, and not because the term would be recognized by others as having such a special meaning. Unless the language is meaningless on its face (e.g. “abracadabra”) or ambiguous, however, the test for admission of parol evidence is not a secret code meaning given to it by the parties but whether it might objectively be recognized by a reasonably intelligent person acquainted with applicable customs, usages and the surrounding circumstances as having such a special meaning. For instance, would an executive in the ice cream business, who was not privy to the secret oral “gentlemen’s agreement,” recognize the term “non-exclusive” in this context and setting as granting an “exclusive” right, subject to certain exceptions or as having a meaning other than that usually attributed to it? If so, parol evidence would be admissible. If the law were otherwise, not only the term “non-exclusive” but every apparently clear term in a written agreement, such as a specific purchase price (e.g., “$10,000”) could be changed by secret oral agreement to mean something different (e.g., “$25,000”).</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, although the term “non-exclusive” as used in the Package Deal does not on its face appear to be ambiguous, Whitelawn–SAS will be afforded the opportunity to offer proof showing that the term is ambiguous, and Eskimo the opportunity to rebut such proof. In accordance with the principles hereinabove outlined, proof on the issue of ambiguity may encompass the terms of the Package Deal itself, the surrounding circumstances, common usage and custom as to the meaning attributed to it and subsequent conduct of the parties under the Package Deal, but evidence of the subjective understanding of the parties as to the meaning attributed by them to the term “non-exclusive” will not be received.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the issue of ambiguity must be determined by the Court before ruling on the admission of parol evidence and since Eskimo might suffer prejudice if such rulings were made in the jury’s presence, the proof with respect to ambiguity will be received at a preliminary hearing by the Court. Upon conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the Court will rule upon the issue of ambiguity, and the admissibility of the evidence at trial will be governed accordingly. Thereupon, pursuant to Rule 42(b), F.R.C.P., the Court will hold a separate jury trial of the issue of liability, to be followed by trial before the same jury of the damage issues, except with respect to issues raised by the sixth claim set forth in the Whitelawn–SAS complaint.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. Is Judge Mansfield’s approach to the parol evidence rule in the <span class="italic">Eskimo Pie</span> case reconcilable with the opinion of Chief Justice Traynor in <span class="italic">PG &amp; E v. G.W. Thomas Drayage</span> and the opinion of Judge Gurfein in <span class="italic">Lee v. J.E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc.</span>? Is the major difference among them one of attitude, or is there a substantial dispute as to what the basic legal rule is? Or do the apparent differences among the opinions demonstrate the truth of Judge Frank’s suggestion on p. 61, that “perhaps nine-tenths of legal uncertainty is caused by uncertainty as to what the court will find, on conflicting evidence, to be the facts of cases”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Chief Justice Traynor says, p. 612, that “rational interpretation requires at least a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties.” Does Judge Mansfield give preliminary consideration to the proof Whitelawn–SAS wishes to introduce as to the meaning intended by the term “nonexclusive”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. Would either Chief Justice Traynor or Judge Mansfield disagree with Justice Holmes, p. 58, that a party would not be permitted to prove that the words “five hundred feet should mean one hundred inches, or that Bunker Hill Monument should signify Old South Church”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">4</span>. Note the variety of proof that Whitelawn–SAS sought to introduce in the <span class="italic">Eskimo Pie</span> case. Does even the strictest reading of the parol evidence rule, p. 599, require exclusion of all of it? What about the subsequent communications and conduct of the parties?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">5</span>. What do you think of the behavior of the attorneys for the parties in this case? Is it appropriate for an attorney to draft a contract so as to make the transaction appear innocent, when in fact he knows that the true deal would raise eyebrows at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department? Should an attorney who papers over a possible antitrust violation in this way be disciplined? Should the attorney be civilly liable to those who are injured by the unlawful deal? If the violation of the antitrust laws is a crime, should the attorney be subject to prosecution? What should the attorney say to his client who comes to him to draft a contract in a deal that looks unlawful? What must the attorney say to the client?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">6</span>. For an interesting comparison of the more “formalist” tendencies of the New York state courts and the more “contextualist” tendencies of the California state courts in matters of contract interpretation and enforcement see Geoffrey Miller, <span class="italic">Bargains Bicoastal: New Light on Contract Theory</span>, 31 C<small>ARDOZO</small> L.

<p id="sec292" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE: FORMALITIES AND INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS</span></p>
<p class="indent">In most of the world, important contracts of all kinds and certain kinds of transactions regardless of importance (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> those involving real estate) are expected to be in writing, and a statute may even require a writing in some circumstances. Nevertheless, the Statute of Frauds or a similar broad requirement that commercial contracts be in writing is found in only a few nations. Even England repealed its Statute of Frauds in 1934. As noted above at p. 579, the CISG permits the proof of a contract “by any means, including witnesses.” CISG Article 11. For sale of goods transactions between a party in the United States and a party from nation that has adopted the CISG (i.e. most of our significant trading partners), therefore, the state Statute of Frauds (typically UCC § 2–201) would presumptively not apply.</p>
<p class="indent">Applying the parol evidence rule to international transactions is even more problematic. The CISG has no rule similar to the parol evidence rule, and in general, in most non-English speaking legal systems, the evidentiary rules strongly favor free use of all relevant evidence. The allocation of responsibility between appellate and trial judges is quite different in most of the world, and jury trial in civil cases outside the United States is unknown or very rare, even among our common law cousins. Therefore, an American judge interpreting a written contract relating to an international sale of goods may be in an unaccustomed position, with little guidance from the CISG on how to go about the interpretive task.</p>

<p class="sectionb">144 F.3d 1384.</p>
<p class="noindentt">■ B<small>IRCH</small>, J. This case requires us to determine whether a court must consider parol evidence in a contract dispute governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (“CISG”). The district court granted summary judgment on behalf of the defendant-appellee, relying on certain terms and provisions that appeared on the reverse of a pre-printed form contract for the sale of ceramic tiles. The plaintiff-appellant sought to rely on a number of affidavits that tended to show both that the parties had arrived at an oral contract before memorializing their agreement in writing and that they subjectively intended not to apply the terms on the reverse of the contract to their agreements. The magistrate judge held that the affidavits did not raise an issue of material fact and recommended that the district court grant summary judgment based on the terms of the contract. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page622" class="pagebreak">622</span>The district court agreed with the magistrate judge’s reasoning and entered summary judgment in the defendant-appellee’s favor. We REVERSE.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">B<small>ACKGROUND</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff-appellant, MCC–Marble Ceramic, Inc. (“MCC”), is a Florida corporation engaged in the retail sale of tiles, and the defendant-appellee, Ceramica Nuova d’Agostino S.p.A. (“D’Agostino”) is an Italian corporation engaged in the manufacture of ceramic tiles. In October 1990, MCC’s president, Juan Carlos Monzon, met representatives of D’Agostino at a trade fair in Bologna, Italy and negotiated an agreement to purchase ceramic tiles from D’Agostino based on samples he examined at the trade fair. Monzon, who spoke no Italian, communicated with Gianni Silingardi, then D’Agostino’s commercial director, through a translator, Gianfranco Copelli, who was himself an agent of D’Agostino. The parties apparently arrived at an oral agreement on the crucial terms of price, quality, quantity, delivery and payment. The parties then recorded these terms on one of D’Agostino’s standard, pre-printed order forms and Monzon signed the contract on MCC’s behalf. According to MCC, the parties also entered into a requirements contract in February 1991, subject to which D’Agostino agreed to supply MCC with high grade ceramic tile at specific discounts as long as MCC purchased sufficient quantities of tile. MCC completed a number of additional order forms requesting tile deliveries pursuant to that agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">MCC brought suit against D’Agostino claiming a breach of the February 1991 requirements contract when D’Agostino failed to satisfy orders in April, May, and August of 1991. In addition to other defenses, D’Agostino responded that it was under no obligation to fill MCC’s orders because MCC had defaulted on payment for previous shipments. In support of its position, D’Agostino relied on the pre-printed terms of the contracts that MCC had executed. The executed forms were printed in Italian and contained terms and conditions on both the front and reverse. According to an English translation of the October 1990 contract,<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_133" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-133" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></sup> the front of the order form contained the following language directly beneath Monzon’s signature:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">[T]he buyer hereby states that he is aware of the sales conditions stated on the reverse and that he expressly approves of them with special reference to those numbered 1–2–3–4–5–6–7–8.</p>
<p class="noindent">Clause 6(b), printed on the back of the form states:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">[D]efault or delay in payment within the time agreed upon gives D’Agostino the right to * * * suspend or cancel the contract itself and to cancel possible other pending contracts and the buyer does not have the right to indemnification or damages.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page623" class="pagebreak">623</div>
<p class="indent">D’Agostino also brought a number of counterclaims against MCC, seeking damages for MCC’s alleged nonpayment for deliveries of tile that D’Agostino had made between February 28, 1991 and July 4, 1991. MCC responded that the tile it had received was of a lower quality than contracted for, and that, pursuant to the CISG, MCC was entitled to reduce payment in proportion to the defects.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_134" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-134" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></sup> D’Agostino, however, noted that clause 4 on the reverse of the contract states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="blockquote_inds">Possible complaints for defects of the merchandise must be made in writing by means of a certified letter within and not later than 10 days after receipt of the merchandise * * *.</p>
<p class="indent">Although there is evidence to support MCC’s claims that it complained about the quality of the deliveries it received, MCC never submitted any written complaints.</p>
<p class="indent">MCC did not dispute these underlying facts before the district court, but argued that the parties never intended the terms and conditions printed on the reverse of the order form to apply to their agreements. As evidence for this assertion, MCC submitted Monzon’s affidavit, which claims that MCC had no subjective intent to be bound by those terms and that D’Agostino was aware of this intent. MCC also filed affidavits from Silingardi and Copelli, D’Agostino’s representatives at the trade fair, which support Monzon’s claim that the parties subjectively intended not to be bound by the terms on the reverse of the order form. The magistrate judge held that the affidavits, even if true, did not raise an issue of material fact regarding the interpretation or applicability of the terms of the written contracts and the district court accepted his recommendation to award summary judgment in D’Agostino’s favor. MCC then filed this timely appeal.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">D<small>ISCUSSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same standards as the district court. Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits reveal that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties to this case agree that the CISG governs their dispute because the United States, where MCC has its place of business, and Italy, where D’Agostino has its place of business, are both States Party to the Convention. Article 8 of the CISG governs the interpretation of international contracts for the sale of goods and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page624" class="pagebreak">624</span>forms the basis of MCC’s appeal from the district court’s grant of summary judgment in D’Agostino’s favor.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_135" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-135" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></sup> MCC argues that the magistrate judge and the district court improperly ignored evidence that MCC submitted regarding the parties’ subjective intent when they memorialized the terms of their agreement on D’Agostino’s pre-printed form contract, and that the magistrate judge erred by applying the parol evidence rule in derogation of the CISG.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">I. Subjective Intent Under the CISG</span></p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to what is familiar practice in United States courts, the CISG appears to permit a substantial inquiry into the parties’ subjective intent, even if the parties did not engage in any objectively ascertainable means of registering this intent. Article 8(1) of the CISG instructs courts to interpret the “statements * * * and other conduct of a party * * * according to his intent” as long as the other party “knew or could not have been unaware” of that intent. The plain language of the Convention, therefore, requires an inquiry into a party’s subjective intent as long as the other party to the contract was aware of that intent.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, MCC has submitted three affidavits that discuss the purported subjective intent of the parties to the initial agreement concluded between MCC and D’Agostino in October 1990. All three affidavits discuss the preliminary negotiations and report that the parties arrived at an oral agreement for D’Agostino to supply quantities of a specific grade of ceramic tile to MCC at an agreed upon price. The affidavits state that the “oral agreement established the essential terms of quality, quantity, description of goods, delivery, price and payment.” The affidavits also note that the parties memorialized the terms of their oral agreement on a standard D’Agostino order form, but all three affiants contend that the parties subjectively intended not to be bound by the terms on the reverse of that form despite a provision <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page625" class="pagebreak">625</span>directly below the signature line that expressly and specifically incorporated those terms.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_136" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-136" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The terms on the reverse of the contract give D’Agostino the right to suspend or cancel all contracts in the event of a buyer’s non-payment and require a buyer to make a written report of all defects within ten days. As the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation makes clear, if these terms applied to the agreements between MCC and D’Agostino, summary judgment would be appropriate because MCC failed to make any written complaints about the quality of tile it received and D’Agostino has established MCC’s non-payment of a number of invoices amounting to $108,389.40 and 102,053,846.00 Italian lira.</p>
<p class="indent">Article 8(1) of the CISG requires a court to consider this evidence of the parties’ subjective intent. Contrary to the magistrate judge’s report, which the district court endorsed and adopted, article 8(1) does not focus on interpreting the parties’ statements alone. Although we agree with the magistrate judge’s conclusion that no “interpretation” of the contract’s terms could support MCC’s position, article 8(1) also requires a court to consider subjective intent while interpreting the conduct of the parties. The CISG’s language, therefore, requires courts to consider evidence of a party’s subjective intent when signing a contract if the other party to the contract was aware of that intent at the time. This is precisely the type of evidence that MCC has provided through the Silingardi, Copelli, and Monzon affidavits, which discuss not only Monzon’s intent as MCC’s representative but also discuss the intent of D’Agostino’s representatives and their knowledge that Monzon did not intend to agree to the terms on the reverse of the form contract. This acknowledgment that D’Agostino’s representatives were aware of Monzon’s subjective intent puts this case squarely within article 8(1) of the CISG, and therefore requires the court to consider MCC’s evidence as it interprets the parties’ conduct.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">II. Parol Evidence and the CISG</span></p>
<p class="indent">Given our determination that the magistrate judge and the district court should have considered MCC’s affidavits regarding the parties’ subjective intentions, we must address a question of first impression in this circuit: whether the parol evidence rule, which bars evidence of an earlier oral contract that contradicts or varies <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page626" class="pagebreak">626</span>the terms of a subsequent or contemporaneous written contract, plays any role in cases involving the CISG. We begin by observing that the parol evidence rule, contrary to its title, is a substantive rule of law, not a rule of evidence. The rule does not purport to exclude a particular type of evidence as an “untrustworthy or undesirable” way of proving a fact, but prevents a litigant from attempting to show “the fact itself—the fact that the terms of the agreement are other than those in the writing.” As such, a federal district court cannot simply apply the parol evidence rule as a procedural matter—as it might if excluding a particular type of evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence, which apply in federal court regardless of the source of the substantive rule of decision.<sup><span class="bold"><a id="fn_137" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-137" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The CISG itself contains no express statement on the role of parol evidence. See Honnold, Uniform Law § 110 at 170. It is clear, however, that the drafters of the CISG were comfortable with the concept of permitting parties to rely on oral contracts because they eschewed any statute of frauds provision and expressly provided for the enforcement of oral contracts. Compare CISG, art. 11 (a contract of sale need not be concluded or evidenced in writing) with U.C.C. § 2–201 (precluding the enforcement of oral contracts for the sale of goods involving more than $500). Moreover, article 8(3) of the CISG expressly directs courts to give “due consideration * * * to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations * * *” to determine the intent of the parties. Given article 8(1)’s directive to use the intent of the parties to interpret their statements and conduct, article 8(3) is a clear instruction to admit and consider parol evidence regarding the negotiations to the extent they reveal the parties’ subjective intent.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the CISG’s broad scope, surprisingly few cases have applied the Convention in the United States, and only two reported decisions touch upon the parol evidence rule, both in <span class="italic">dicta</span>. One court has concluded, much as we have above, that the parol evidence rule is not viable in CISG cases in light of article 8 of the Convention….</p>
<p class="indent">Our reading of article 8(3) as a rejection of the parol evidence rule, however, is in accordance with the great weight of academic commentary on the issue. As one scholar has explained:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[T]he language of Article 8(3) that “due consideration is to be given to all relevant circumstances of the case” seems adequate to override any domestic rule <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page627" class="pagebreak">627</span>that would bar a tribunal from considering the relevance of other agreements * * *. Article 8(3) relieves tribunals from domestic rules that might bar them from “considering” any evidence between the parties that is relevant. This added flexibility for interpretation is consistent with a growing body of opinion that the “parol evidence rule” has been an embarrassment for the administration of modern transactions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Honnold, Uniform Law § 110 at 170–71….</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that parties to an international contract for the sale of goods cannot depend on written contracts or that parol evidence regarding subjective contractual intent need always prevent a party relying on a written agreement from securing summary judgment. To the contrary, most cases will not present a situation (as exists in this case) in which both parties to the contract acknowledge a subjective intent not to be bound by the terms of a pre-printed writing. In most cases, therefore, article 8(2) of the CISG will apply, and objective evidence will provide the basis for the court’s decision. Consequently, a party to a contract governed by the CISG will not be able to avoid the terms of a contract and force a jury trial simply by submitting an affidavit which states that he or she did not have the subjective intent to be bound by the contract’s terms. Moreover, to the extent parties wish to avoid parol evidence problems they can do so by including a merger clause in their agreement that extinguishes any and all prior agreements and understandings not expressed in the writing.</p>
<p class="indent">Considering MCC’s affidavits in this case, however, we conclude that the magistrate judge and the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of D’Agostino. Although the affidavits are, as D’Agostino observes, relatively conclusory and unsupported by facts that would objectively establish MCC’s intent not to be bound by the conditions on the reverse of the form, article 8(1) requires a court to consider evidence of a party’s subjective intent when the other party was aware of it, and the Silingardi and Copelli affidavits provide that evidence. This is not to say that the affidavits are conclusive proof of what the parties intended. A reasonable finder of fact, for example, could disregard testimony that purportedly sophisticated international merchants signed a contract without intending to be bound as simply too incredible to believe and hold MCC to the conditions printed on the reverse of the contract. Nevertheless, the affidavits raise an issue of material fact regarding the parties’ intent to incorporate the provisions on the reverse of the form contract. If the finder of fact determines that the parties did not intend to rely on those provisions, then the more general provisions of the CISG will govern the outcome of the dispute.</p>
<p class="indent">MCC’s affidavits, however, do not discuss all of the transactions and orders that MCC placed with D’Agostino. Each of the affidavits discusses the parties’ subjective intent surrounding the initial order MCC placed with D’Agostino in October <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page628" class="pagebreak">628</span>1990. The Copelli affidavit also discusses a February 1991 requirements contract between the parties and reports that the parties subjectively did not intend the terms on the reverse of the D’Agostino order form to apply to that contract either. D’Agostino, however, submitted the affidavit of its chairman, Vincenzo Maselli, which describes at least three other orders from MCC on form contracts dated January 15, 1991, April 27, 1991, and May 4, 1991, in addition to the October 1990 contract. MCC’s affidavits do not discuss the subjective intent of the parties to be bound by language in those contracts, and D’Agostino, therefore, argues that we should affirm summary judgment to the extent damages can be traced to those order forms. It is unclear from the record, however, whether all of these contracts contained the terms that appeared in the October 1990 contract. Moreover, because article 8 requires a court to consider any “practices which the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties” in interpreting contracts, CISG, art. 8(3), whether the parties intended to adhere to the ten day limit for complaints, as stated on the reverse of the initial contract, will have an impact on whether MCC was bound to adhere to the limit on subsequent deliveries. Since material issues of fact remain regarding the interpretation of the remaining contracts between MCC and D’Agostino, we cannot affirm any portion of the district court’s summary judgment in D’Agostino’s favor.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><span class="bold">C<small>ONCLUSION</small></span></p>
<p class="indent">MCC asks us to reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of D’Agostino. The district court’s decision rests on pre-printed contractual terms and conditions incorporated on the reverse of a standard order form that MCC’s president signed on the company’s behalf. Nevertheless, we conclude that the CISG, which governs international contracts for the sale of goods, precludes summary judgment in this case because MCC has raised an issue of material fact concerning the parties’ subjective intent to be bound by the terms on the reverse of the pre-printed contract. The CISG also precludes the application of the parol evidence rule, which would otherwise bar the consideration of evidence concerning a prior or contemporaneously negotiated oral agreement. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment and REMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p id="sec294" class="notes"><span class="bold">QUESTIONS AND NOTES</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">1</span>. On the facts of this case, would the parol evidence rule cause injustice or prevent it?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">2</span>. Why didn’t the magistrate or the district court realize that the CISG allows parol evidence?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page629" class="pagebreak">629</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="bold">3</span>. CISG Art. 6 provides: “The parties may … derogate from or vary the effect of any of [the Convention’s] provisions.” Presumably this is the basis for the Court of Appeals’ suggestion at p. 627 that even under the CISG: “to the extent parties wish to avoid parol evidence problems, they can do so by including a merger clause in their agreement that extinguishes any and all prior agreements and understandings not expressed in the writing.” But is this really so? What if one of the paragraphs on the back of the D’Agostino form was a merger clause? The court in <span class="italic">TeeVee Toons v. Schubert</span>, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59455 (S.D.N.Y. 2006), found that the validity of the merger clause itself was a question of the intent of the parties which could be proven by any relevant evidence notwithstanding the parol evidence rule. Only if the parties actually intended to incorporate the parol evidence rule into their agreement (based on all the evidence) would they be deemed to have exercised their right under CISG Art. 6 to opt out of Art. 11. If the parties in <span class="italic">MCC Marble</span> did not intend to include <span class="bold"><span class="italic">any</span></span> of the boilerplate in the D’Agostino form in their agreement, what difference would it make if there is an integration clause in Italian buried in the fine print?</p>

<p id="sec295" class="notes"><span class="bold">NOTE ON RECONSIDERING CONSIDERATION</span></p>
<p class="indent">This is probably a good time to pause and look back on the six chapters you have just completed. Reconsider <span class="italic">Best v. Southland</span>, p. 13, and the legal definition of enforceable promises. The doctrine you have learned from these chapters reflects the law as stated in statutes and judicial opinions. Yet the rules seem to have an exception available for just about every case in which a serious and sensible promise might not be enforced for lack of consideration. This is most obvious if promissory estoppel and similar ideas of unbargained-for action in reliance are carried to their logical extremes. It appears more subtly if one focuses on the outcomes of cases, rather than what the courts state to be the law.</p>
<p class="indent">The doctrine of consideration is often cited and saluted as a correct statement of the law, but it is only infrequently applied to throw out a serious and sensible deal. The editors of this Casebook made up <span class="italic">Best v.

Professor Andrew Kull states the matter boldly and provocatively:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">The modern literature on gratuitous noncommercial promises assumes the continued applicability of standard consideration doctrine to this class of cases. Yet to judge by the American decisions of the last several decades, courts are no longer willing to regard the absence of consideration as a sufficient reason to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page630" class="pagebreak">630</span>deny the enforceability of a promise; with the result that “want of consideration” is rarely an insuperable obstacle to enforcement of a gratuitous promise that is both unequivocal and seriously intended….</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A little over a generation ago it was still possible to decry the mischief caused by certain well-known consequences of consideration doctrine in a commercial setting: the “preexisting duty rule” that hindered contract modifications, or the requirement that a “firm offer” or option be supported by separate consideration. Given the far greater likelihood today that the good-faith modification will be enforced, and that the firm offer will be honored, anyone curious about how the law treats truly gratuitous promises must look outside the business world. The fundamental choices for a system of contract law that have always been implicated by the doctrine of consideration are accordingly debated against a background of gratuitous and unrelied-upon promises made by uncles to nephews, by grateful beneficiaries to selfless rescuers, by charitable widows to worthy causes. It is not always noticed—so secure are the assumptions about doctrines in this area—that the most visible of these promises have long been enforced.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">More recent cases involving gratuitous promises in noncommercial settings suggest that the absence of consideration, in and of itself, is unlikely to constitute a bar to legal enforceability. Promises found by the courts to have been actually made and seriously intended will typically be found either to be supported by consideration or else to have induced reliance. To meet the requirements of doctrine in the harder cases, judges will point to “consideration” that would not satisfy the usual definition or else find “reliance” despite the absence of any significant change of position on the part of the promisee. Two broad categories of gift promises, charitable subscriptions and marriage settlements, are now routinely enforced as being sui generis.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">A rule denying enforceability to gift promises might be justified if it were true that gratuitous transactions, as a class, were distinctively lacking in social importance. While an exchange of goods, according to Fuller, is “a transaction which conduces to the production of wealth and the division of labor,” a gift—here he quotes an otherwise forgotten set of nineteenth-century lectures on the French Civil Code—is merely a “‘sterile transmission.’”</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Nothing authorizes the conjecture that a gratuitous transfer produces less economic utility than an otherwise comparable transaction in a bargain context. Unless a voluntary transaction is beneficial to the parties, it will not take place. (Whether a particular gift also “conduces to the production of wealth and the division of labor” will presumably depend on the circumstances; but the same may be said of bargains.) Unsurprisingly, then, our legal system makes no discrimination against gratuitous transactions per se: the executed gift is enforced on the same terms as the completed sale. The argument that gratuitous promises <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page631" class="pagebreak">631</span>do not merit enforcement cannot depend, therefore, on the proposition that the gratuitous transfer is itself unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Kull’s critique is limited by the lesson Professor Eisenberg taught in the article excerpted on pp. 574-575: Were the common law to abandon the consideration doctrine as a limit on enforcing donative promises we would not solve, but would only shift our difficulties. For then, like the law in most of the world, typified by the French and German Civil Codes, we would have to deal under some new rubric with the possibilities of improvident donors and ungrateful recipients.</p>
<p class="indent">As is often the case, no one can say it better than Professor Corbin:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">So far as human history has gone, the fact is that we do not wish to enforce all promises and the courts have not enforced all promises. Therefore, we must continue to determine the factors that make promises enforceable; and our legal history will compel us to do this under some such title as “consideration.” Doubtless, this would not be denied by those who have suggested the abandonment of the “doctrine.” It may well be that they had in mind some specific form of doctrine that, like the present author, they knew did not explain all the cases. The American Law Institute has adopted a definition of “consideration” that limits it to something that is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise; but immediately it devotes ten sections to inform us what other factors will make a promise enforceable. The term “consideration” can be totally abandoned as well as limited; we should then instantly be obliged to consider, under other descriptions, the factors that will make a promise enforceable.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">However variable and widely or narrowly inclusive the usage of the term “consideration” may be, we shall have to struggle along with it in the process of differentiating between enforceable and non-enforceable promises.</p>

<p class="fn_txti">Testimony revealed that GM estimates the cost of, and establishes a budget reserve for, both warranty repairs and goodwill adjustments for the lifetime of every make and model of vehicle. Twice annually, GM internally audits both the cost of warranty repairs and that of the goodwill policy for each make and model of vehicle. A GM representative explained that the vehicle sales price is designed to recover all costs, including those associated with the goodwill adjustment policy, as well as to maintain profitability.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-94" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_94" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>.  We note the possibility of arbitration merely to provide a comprehensive outline of the complaint resolution procedure. In light of our analysis, it is not necessary to consider whether the possibility of arbitration is a form of “consideration” in this case.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-95" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_95" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>.  While acknowledging that a customer pays for the goodwill program, the dissent “cannot fathom” that a customer would bargain for the opportunity to have postwarranty complaints addressed. This skepticism is inconsistent with this Court’s traditional reluctance to question the sufficiency of consideration and is not justification to override the Legislature’s expression of intent in UTA § 4(1)(a) to avoid the pyramiding of the sales and use taxes.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-96" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>.  While not part of our dispositive analysis, it is noteworthy that GM audits the cost of the goodwill adjustment policy twice annually with the goal of recovering costs and maintaining profitability. A witness for the department acknowledged that GM uses the same method to account for the cost of warranty repairs and goodwill policy adjustments. It is evident that GM attempts to effectively include the cost of warranty repairs in the retail price of its vehicles. The record reflects that the cost of the goodwill adjustment policy is likewise included in the retail price of GM vehicles. A GM witness testified that “implicit in the price is the fact that we need to cover all the costs, and both policy and warranty are costs that are included….”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-97" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_97" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a>.  As stated by Professor Arthur Corbin:</p>
<p class="fn_txt1">Promissory words are not nullified by making the promise conditional on some event within the promisor’s own power, if at the same time the promisor impliedly promises to make a reasonable effort to bring the event about or to use good faith and honest judgment in determining whether or not it has in fact occurred.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-98" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_98" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a>.  Because the sale of a vehicle is the sale of a good, a contract for such a sale is subject to the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-99" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_99" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a>.  We note that this is a greater right than the inherent ability to complain possessed by consumers generally. While a customer would typically have the practical ability to bring a complaint to the attention of a manufacturer, absent a contractual or other legal duty, the manufacturer would be free to simply ignore such complaints without giving them any consideration. However, because of its contractual undertaking for the goodwill policy, GM has a duty to consider such complaints in good faith.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-100" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_100" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a>.  This point is reinforced by Professor Samuel Williston:</p>
<p class="fn_txt1">It is an elementary and oft quoted principle that the law will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration so long as the consideration is otherwise valid to support a promise. By this is meant that so long as the requirement of a bargained-for benefit or detriment is satisfied, the fact that the relative value or worth of the exchange is unequal is irrelevant so that anything which fulfills the requirement of consideration will support a promise, regardless of the comparative value of the consideration and of the thing promised. The rule is almost as old as the doctrine of consideration itself.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-101" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_101" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a>.  In concluding that the goodwill program amounted to an illusory promise, the Court of Appeals referenced <span class="italic">Barbat v. M E Arden Co.,</span> for the proposition that “[a]n unenforceable promise cannot constitute consideration.” However, that case is inapplicable because it involved a promised performance that was “unenforceable” because it was void as illegal.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-102" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_102" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a>.  The dissent asserts that “[m]erely because plaintiff proved through its accounting methods that it charges all consumers for costs associated with a program …, I cannot conclude that ‘consideration’ was paid by purchasers….” If this statement does not set forth the very essence of “consideration,” it is hard to know what the term means. Of course, we recognize that not <span class="italic">every</span> cost factored into the price of a manufacturer’s product is exempt from use tax as a form of “consideration” to a customer. Costs that do not provide a benefit to a customer could not be consideration.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-103" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_103" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>.  Contrary to the implication by the majority, plaintiff’s participation in arbitration is in no way guaranteed. While a consumer may always request arbitration, plaintiff reserves the right to refuse to participate. <span class="italic">See</span> 1990 Warranty and Owner Assistance Information for Buick New Cars (“GM will <span class="italic">generally</span> agree to be bound by the arbitrator’s decision…. [GM] reserves the right to change eligibility limitations and/or to discontinue its participation in the program” [emphasis added] ).</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-104" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_104" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>.  Like the majority, I respect the doctrine that generally prohibits courts from questioning the adequacy of consideration. Unfortunately, that doctrine is inapplicable here because absolutely no consideration for the goodwill parts passed between the parties at the retail sale. Merely because plaintiff proved through its accounting methods that it charges all consumers for costs associated with a program that results in free or discounted parts to some, I cannot conclude that “consideration” was paid by purchasers at the retail sale for goodwill parts. GM’s $82 million worth of repairs, while certainly of value, simply cannot be regarded as legal consideration.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">Further, the majority implies that any cost factored into the price of the car by GM should be exempt from use tax. If that were the case, no manufacturer would ever pay use tax because generally all costs work their way into the price of products. The statute as currently drafted does not provide an exclusion per se for all costs factored into product prices, only those for which consideration has passed at a retail sale. The majority also presumes that a customer can pinpoint the costs associated with a program it knows nothing of and buy the car in part on the basis of the promised value associated with the goodwill policy. The error lies in that assumption. We cannot assume market participants are making rationale choices when they lack sufficient knowledge of the goodwill policy. Neither GM nor the dealer bargains over this product with the consumer. GM keeps the terms and scope of the program confidential, thereby making it impossible for a consumer to pay for such a program with consideration. The majority’s attempt to rebut my position ignores the foundational principles of consideration, i.e., bargained-for consideration is absent where “the action that the promisee took was <span class="italic">not induced</span> by the promise.” Farnsworth, Contracts, (2d ed.), § 2.6, p. 52 (emphasis in original). In this case, plaintiff simply fails to give consumers an opportunity to be induced by the alleged benefit.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-105" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_105" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  In an attempt to refute my position, the majority erroneously infers the following:</p>
<p class="fn_txt1">[T]he dissent would decline to rule that GM’s promise is valid consideration in part because GM’s customers have “little if any” knowledge of the scope of GM’s discretion. That it is unknown how liberally GM will exercise its discretion does not mean there is no discretion. In fact, it means there is discretion, i.e., a benefit to the consumer.</p>
<p class="fn_txt">To clarify, I conclude that GM’s parts cannot constitute valid consideration because the consumers did not bargain for, and were not induced to act because of, the goodwill policy in general or the parts in particular. Moreover, I agree that GM has discretion. In fact, GM has so much discretion that it would be impossible for consumers to bring an action claiming that discretion was exercised without good faith. The majority errs by inferring from my statement that describes a consumer’s lack of knowledge concerning the scope of GM’s discretion that the existence of discretion is itself dispositive of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-106" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_106" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a>.  MCL 205.94(1)(c) exempts from use tax certain promotional items, which include:</p>
<p class="fn_txt1">[P]romotional merchandise transferred pursuant to a redemption offer to a person located outside this state or any packaging material, <span class="italic">other than promotional merchandise,</span> acquired for use in fulfilling a redemption offer or rebate to a person located outside this state.

The Iowa workers’ compensation act states in pertinent part that:</p>

Accordingly, we assume, even though the evidence was in conflict on the point, that the $100,000 loan was vital to the survival of the company.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-109" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_109" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>.  The question of what ethical duties apply when a client offers an attorney a gift has not been briefed and we do not address it. Passante’s entire focus has been on enforcing the promise of stock as the fruit of a bargain, not as a completed gift.</p>

A provision which would limit the termination rights of a party may be implied into the bargain under some circumstances.</p>

In 1747, Lord Hardwicke, sitting as Lord Chancellor, observed: “The meaning of the statute is to reduce contracts to a certainty, in order to avoid perjury on the one hand, and fraud on the other, and therefore, both in this court and the courts of common law, when an agreement has been reduced to such a certainty, and the substance of the statute has been complied with in the material part, the forms have never been insisted upon.” (<span class="italic">Welford v. Beazely</span> (1747) 26 Eng.Rep. 1090 (Ch.); accord, <span class="italic">Moss v. Atkinson, supra</span>, 44 Cal. 3, 16; <span class="italic">Clason’s Ex’rs v. Bailey</span> (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1817) 14 Johns 484; <span class="italic">Higdon v. Thomas</span> (Md.1827) 1 H. &amp; G. 139.)</p>

In H<span class="italic">ouse of Prayer v. Evangelical Assn. for India</span> (2003), the court reasoned that because contracts for the sale of real property are enforceable without specification of a time of performance, that term is not essential under the statute of frauds.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-121" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_121" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a>.  Defendants do not here challenge the sufficiency of Taylor’s signature on the March 15 letter to meet the subscription requirement of the statute of frauds. Both the letter and the March 13 memorandum may be considered together to satisfy the statute. The parties’ dispute concerns only the terms of the memorandum.</p>

A skillful attorney can conjure ambiguities from nearly any document, but such hypothetical difficulties often disappear when the surrounding circumstances are considered.</p>

I don’t want to make the law look ridiculous, Mr. Clause, because it is one day later, one day too much, and that one day is a Sunday, and a non working day.</p>

In such case the court may admit the evidence conditionally by either reserving its ruling on the objection or by admitting the evidence subject to a motion to strike.</p>

This statement of the rule is harmless if it is kept in mind that the ambiguity may be exposed by extrinsic evidence that reveals more than one possible meaning.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-132" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_132" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>.  The court’s exclusion of extrinsic evidence in this case would be error even under a rule that excluded such evidence when the instrument appeared to the court to be clear and unambiguous on its face. The controversy centers on the meaning of the word “indemnify” and the phrase “all loss, damage, expense and liability.” The trial court’s recognition of the language as typical of a third party indemnity clause and the double sense in which the word “indemnify” is used in statutes and defined in dictionaries demonstrate the existence of an ambiguity. (Compare Civ.Code, § 2772, “Indemnity is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties, or of some other person,” with Civ.Code, § 2527, “Insurance is a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability, arising from an unknown or contingent event.” Black’s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) defines “indemnity” as “A collateral contract or assurance, by which one person engages to secure another against an anticipated loss or to prevent him from being damnified by the legal consequences of an act or forbearance on the part of one of the parties or of some third person.” Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary (2d ed. 1903) defines it as a “Contract * * * to indemnify against a liability.* * *” One of the definitions given to “indemnify” by Webster’s Third New International Dict. (1961 ed.) is “to exempt from incurred liabilities.”)</p>
<p class="fn_txti">Plaintiff’s assertion that the use of the word “all” to modify “loss, damage, expense and liability” dictates an all inclusive interpretation is not persuasive. If the word “indemnify” encompasses only third party claims, the word “all” simply refers to all such claims. The use of the words “loss,” “damage,” and “expense” in addition to the word “liability” is likewise inconclusive. These words do not imply an agreement to reimburse for injury to an indemnitee’s property since they are commonly inserted in third party indemnity clauses, to enable an indemnitee who settles a claim to recover from his indemnitor without proving his liability. Civ.Code, § 2778, provides: “1. Upon an indemnity against liability * * * the person indemnified is entitled to recover upon becoming liable; 2. Upon an indemnity against claims, or demands, or damages, or costs * * * the person indemnified is not entitled to recover without payment thereof; * * *.”</p>
<p class="fn_txti">The provision that defendant perform the work, “at his own risk and expense” and the provisions relating to insurance are equally inconclusive. By agreeing to work at its own risk defendant may have released plaintiff from liability for any injuries to defendant’s property arising out of the contract’s performance, but this provision did not necessarily make defendant an insurer against injuries to plaintiff’s property. Defendant’s agreement to procure liability insurance to cover damages to plaintiff’s property does not indicate whether the insurance was to cover all injuries or only injuries caused by defendant’s negligence.</p>

<p class="fn_txti">(1) For the purposes of this Convention statements made by and other conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to his intent where the other party knew or could not have been unaware what that intent was.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">(2) If the preceding paragraph is not applicable, statements made by and conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to the understanding a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would have had in the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="fn_txti">(3) In determining the intent of a party or the understanding a reasonable person would have had, due consideration is to be given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices which the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties.</p>

This fact is of no assistance to MCC’s position. We find it nothing short of astounding that an individual, purportedly experienced in commercial matters, would sign a contract in a foreign language and expect not to be bound simply because he could not comprehend its terms. We find nothing in the CISG that might counsel this type of reckless behavior and nothing that signals any retreat from the proposition that parties who sign contracts will be bound by them regardless of whether they have read them or understood them.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-137" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/17_chapter06.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_137" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a>.  An example demonstrates this point. The CISG provides that a contract for the sale of goods need not be in writing and that the parties may prove the contract “by any means, including witnesses.” CISG, art. 11. Nevertheless, a party seeking to prove a contract in such a manner in federal court could not do so in a way that violated in the rule against hearsay. See Fed.R.Evid. 802 (barring hearsay evidence). A federal district court applies the Federal Rules of Evidence because these rules are considered procedural, regardless of the source of the law that governs the substantive decision.</p>
