<p class="indent">If the basic remedies described in Chapter Two were the whole story, the law of contract damages would be simple, but stringent. The basic remedies are not the whole story because when tested by real cases they produce too many unsatisfactory results both for parties planning transactions and for courts trying to reach a just resolution in a particular dispute. An aggrieved party with a legitimate claim may be left with no damages remedy (or six cents in nominal damages) notwithstanding an apparently significant loss. At the other extreme, if the grant of consequential damages becomes too liberal, the risks of contract increase and prices rise.</p>
<p class="indent">Four ways out of contract remedies problems that are worthy of note will be considered in this Chapter. First, the potential of contract damages to deny justified relief is limited by the presence of an alternative set of restitutionary remedies. Second, in aggravated cases courts may lift the matter bodily out of the conceptual framework of contract and give it the more hospitable label of tort, making new and more generous damage rules available. Third, in many situations the parties may preplan appropriate remedies by liquidated damages clauses. Finally, parties may contract out of the law courts altogether by arbitration agreements that empower a new set of tribunals applying distinct rules.</p>
<p class="indent">A characteristic of judge-made law is that principles emerge slowly as experience accretes in deciding disputes day by day. In any dispute worth fighting about, there will be two sides to the story. Sometimes one side will be more compelling and sometimes the other, and so the common law contains divergent, if not discordant, strains. Two or more lines of decision may emerge. Sometimes an appellate court will definitively decide that one is the law and the other is not. More often the courts will try to minimize the inconsistencies, reconciling the cases and distinguishing the factors that lead toward different results. Very often contradictions are resolved by announcing two separate principles, erecting a high wall between them and scoffing at naive questions that suggest that there is a connection. It is not enough, therefore, to learn the basic scheme we have described for contract damages. One must also be aware of the available alternatives should basic contract doctrine lead in undesirable directions.</p>

<h3 id="sec98" class="section"><b>I.    R<small>ESTITUTION</small></b></h3>
<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">One ancient alternative set of remedies to those provided by the rules of contract damages is known by a variety of names, including restitution, unjust enrichment, the common counts, general assumpsit, quasi-contract, or <span class="italic">quantum meruit.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Damages and specific performance in theory give the injured party the promised performance either directly (specific performance) or by substituting its financial equivalent (damages). Both seek to put the injured party in the position it would have been in had the contract been performed. But this expectancy of performance is not the only interest protected in contract transactions. A party may pay in advance or expend money, time and material in performing its part of the contract. If a breach occurs and the transaction collapses, such a party may just want its money back or compensation for what it has expended in part performance. In such a case, the injured party seeks to be restored to the position it would have been in had there never been a contract, instead of damages to provide the financial equivalent of performance of the contract. Such claims look backwards in time to the parties’ positions before entering into their contract, rather than toward their expected future positions after the contract is fulfilled by performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of these expenditures may have directly benefitted the breaching party, and the injured party will feel entitled to compensation measured by this unjust enrichment. But it may be that the injured party’s action in reliance on the promise has produced no obvious benefit to the breaching party; nonetheless, the injured party deserves compensation for its justified reliance. Although the distinctions between these three interests (expectancy, restitution and reliance) were recognized as long ago as Aristotle, the common law made no clear choice among them. Early decisions can be found that apply sometimes one and sometimes another in a promissory situation. As we have already noted, the legal measures of damages have always been vague and the computation of damages treated largely as a question of fact for the jury.</p>
<p class="indent">Modern American contract law continues to emphasize the expectancy interest, seeking to give the injured party the financial equivalent of performance. Sometimes outlays in reliance are used as a substitute measure of expectancy damages, particularly when it appears that full performance would not have yielded a profit for the plaintiff. In addition, the law has allowed the injured party to elect alternative restitutionary forms of relief if it wants to.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the confusion concerning restitution is traceable to the use of the same Latin phrase, <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>, to describe two different kinds of claims. The original use was to recover the reasonable value of goods (<span class="italic">quantum valebant</span>) or services (<span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>) delivered pursuant to defendant’s explicit request and express or <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page189" >189</span>implied in fact promise to pay the reasonable value (instead of a specific price) of what was to be delivered. A car owner’s request to the mechanic to “fix the car,” with no agreement on price, implies a promise to pay the reasonable value of the work the mechanic does on the car. In modern usage quantum meruit has come to be commonly used to include actions for both goods and for services.</p>
<p class="indent">The second meaning of quantum meruit arose when the common law courts appropriated the substance of the equitable remedy of restitution by asserting that every contract included a fictional promise that if the contract were breached, the breaching party would pay the value of any performance rendered by the nonbreaching party. Take a builder who lays the foundation and puts the frame and roof on a house before the owner wrongfully terminates the contract. The builder may sue in quantum meruit for the value of work, instead of his damages. If the job was difficult and the anticipated profits lost by the breach were low, the wronged party is likely to prefer being paid the fair value of the partial performance rather than damages. As generations passed, implied promises to pay measurable value conferred became increasingly fictitious and were used to force disgorgement in situations that were not contractual in any realistic sense. This fiction, sometimes called “quasi contract,” provided judges with a flexible tool to do justice but muddied the conceptual stream of the law to the chagrin of law professors and the dismay of students.</p>
<p class="indent">By a comparatively recent expansion of quasi contract theory, the restitutionary remedy became available in many states to breaching parties as well as innocent ones when the value of the partial performance before breach significantly exceeded the non-breaching party’s damages. Return to our example, but now suppose that the builder rather than the owner breached after the foundation, frame, and roof are in place. The homeowner never promised to pay for a foundation, frame, or roof, as such; he promised only to pay for a house. Nevertheless, the builder may be permitted to maintain a quantum meruit action for the value to the owner of the work done to the extent it exceeds the owner’s damage from the breach. To do otherwise would unjustly enrich the owner by the reduced cost of building his house that results from the builder’s abortive efforts.</p>
<p class="indent">American law has come to recognize restitution, or quasi contract, as a distinct body of legal rules. Be warned that the area is not subject to easy conceptual analysis; rules are confusing, and there are substantial inconsistencies and variations among different jurisdictions. Fortunately, casebooks do not have to be conceptually neat. This book will not attempt to reconcile the divergent positions taken by courts in various states and by scholarly authorities.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page190" >190</div>
<p class="indent">As Professor Dan Dobbs observes in his three volume treatise:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Most generalizations about restitution are trustworthy only so long as they are not very meaningful, and meaningful only so long as they are not very trustworthy. There are, however, some core ideas…. Restitution is a simple word but a difficult subject, partly because restitutionary ideas appear in many guises.</p>
<p class="noindent">D<small>AN</small> B. D<small>OBBS</small>, R<small>EMEDIES</small>: D<small>AMAGES</small>, E<small>QUITY</small>, R<small>ESTITUTION</small> 551 (2d ed. 1993).</p>
<p class="indent">At this point in your studies, a few general principles will suffice.</p>
<p class="indent">(1) In most jurisdictions, the restitutionary claim is stated by a “common count,” alleging an implied promise to pay quantum meruit separate and apart from the allegation of an express contract. This claim can stand without inevitable inconsistency alongside a claim for contract damages based on the allegation of breach of an express agreement. The two claims will be considered by the court in the same lawsuit but remain distinct in theory and practice. The “common count” or restitutionary claim usually is pleaded separately from the contract claim. A plaintiff may recover under a contract theory for damages or in restitution, but not both.</p>
<p class="indent">Restitutionary recovery and contract damages are calculated in different ways, and in a given case one may yield a significantly larger recovery for the plaintiff. Plaintiffs are likely to plead both theories and finally elect the one that promises the greatest reward. The point in the lawsuit when the election must be made varies among jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The basic measure of restitutionary recovery is the value of the benefit plaintiff conferred on defendant. But there are usually conflicting possible measures of “value.” For example, should the value of the part performance be measured by the contract price or by a fair market price? In most cases involving a plaintiff who is not in breach itself, the courts generally presume that a fair market value measure is appropriate. The question of under what circumstances the contract price may serve as a limit on restitutionary recovery for a party not in breach is controversial. The weight of judicial authority, however, denies the breaching party the protection of the contract it has violated in at least some circumstances, particularly if the innocent plaintiff would otherwise suffer a loss under the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, restitution will be attractive to a non-breaching party that has put more value into performance than is likely to be awarded as contract damages. In other words, restitution is a preferred remedy for the innocent party to a losing contract because it allows the loser to get out of the deal without the loss it would have suffered if it had performed the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that this somewhat anomalous result has been the subject of much scholarly criticism, particularly over the last 20 years. Although the Restatement <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page191" >191</span>(Second) of Contracts § 373(1), promulgated in 1979, nevertheless embraces this result, the Restatement (Third) of Restitution §§ 37-38 (2011) expressly criticizes and rejects this rule, limiting even the non-breaching party in restitution to a recovery based on contract price. It remains to be seen whether the courts will follow this newer approach. <span class="italic">See</span> William J. Woodward, Jr., <span class="italic">Restitution Without Context: An Examination of the Losing Contract Problem in the Restatement (Third) of Restitution</span>, <span class="italic">in</span> B<small>RAUCHER</small> <span class="italic">et al.</span>, R<small>EVISITING THE</small> C<small>ONTRACTS</small> S<small>CHOLARSHIP OF</small> S<small>TEWART</small> M<small>ACAULEY</small> (Hart 2013) (critiquing new approach of Restatement (Third) of Restitution and suggesting that “the proponents of change have not met their normative burden, and that the courts who have worked in the thicket of relational contracts are more likely to have got it ‘right’ than the theorists.”). Even under the older Restatement (Second) of Contracts view, however, recovery is limited in the case where restitution is sought by a non-breaching party who has fully performed its end of the bargain. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 373(2). In such a case, the plaintiff, although innocent, is not permitted to claim that the performance was worth more than the price agreed upon. The obligation of the breaching party is considered a liquidated debt which is the limit of recovery on either a contract or a restitution claim. So, for example, a seller who delivers goods and then sues for breach when the buyer fails to pay may recover only the contract price and may not claim that the goods were worth more on the market.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that under any view, when a <span class="italic">breaching</span> party is claiming, its recovery is definitely limited by the contract price. This just makes good sense, for otherwise (if prices have risen sharply) the breaching party would recover more by breaching the contract than it would by performing.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The value of the part performance may be measured in terms of the benefit received by the defendant (the extent of unjust enrichment), or by the value of what the plaintiff put out (the extent of reliance). These two measurements need not produce the same result. In a personal service contract, for example, the value of the plaintiff’s services on the labor market may be much more than the benefit received by the defendant in respect of those services, particularly if the performance was not satisfactory. The market value of home renovation services, for example, commonly exceeds any resulting increase in the market value of the home renovated. Less commonly, services may in particular cases result in a windfall profit from the perspective of the employer greatly exceeding the market wage when viewed. While there is less uniformity than might be wished, a sound general statement is that courts take into account which party has breached. When restitution in a contract transaction is sought by a non-breaching plaintiff, the value will generally be measured by the market value of the goods or services provided by the plaintiff. When restitution is sought by a party in breach, the value will generally be limited to the lesser of the benefit received by the defendant and the market value of the services.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page192" >192</div>
<p class="indent">(4) The use of the term <span class="italic">value</span> covers and frequently obscures a number of issues that lie in the borderland between law and accounting. For example, is the value of a plaintiff’s past performance to be limited by its out of pocket costs? What allowance, if any, is to be made for direct and indirect overhead, profit, or return on invested capital? To the extent that market value is used, which market is referred to? Remember that restitution is sought after <span class="italic">part</span> performance. On what market are partially excavated cellars, houses without walls or roofs, or two-thirds of a well-drafted will sold? Judges tend to become very confused by such issues, and the few opinions that are reported provide little reliable guidance.</p>

<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 370. Requirement That Benefit Be Conferred.</span></h4>
<p class="blockquote">A party is entitled to restitution under the rules stated in this Restatement only to the extent that he has conferred a benefit on the other party by way of part performance or reliance.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1"><span class="italic">a. Meaning of Requirement.</span> A party’s restitution interest is his interest in having restored to him any benefit that he has conferred on the other party. See § 344(2). Restitution is, therefore, available to a party only to the extent that he has conferred a benefit on the other party. The benefit may result from the transfer of property or from services, including forbearance. See Restatement of Restitution § 1, Comment <span class="italic">b.</span> The benefit is ordinarily conferred by performance by the party seeking restitution, and receipt by the other party of performance that he bargained for is regarded as a benefit. However, a benefit may also be conferred if the party seeking restitution relies on the contract in some other way, as where he makes improvements on property that does not ultimately become his. However, a party’s expenditures in preparation for performance that do not confer a benefit on the other party do not give rise to a restitution interest…. If, for example, the performance consists of the manufacture and delivery of goods and the buyer wrongfully prevents its completion, the seller is not entitled to restitution because no benefit has been conferred on the buyer…. The injured party may, however, have an action for damages, including one for recovery based on his reliance interest (§ 349). The requirement of this Section is generally satisfied if a benefit has been conferred, and it is immaterial that it was later lost, destroyed or squandered….</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page193" >193</div>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 371. Measure of Restitution Interest.</span></h4>
<p class="blockquote">If a sum of money is awarded to protect a party’s restitution interest, it may as justice requires be measured by either</p>
<p class="list">(a) the reasonable value to the other party of what he received in terms of what it would have cost him to obtain it from a person in the claimant’s position, or</p>
<p class="list">(b) the extent to which the other party’s property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1"><span class="italic">a. Measurement of Benefit.</span> Under the rules stated in §§ 344 and 370, a party who is liable in restitution for a sum of money must pay an amount equal to the benefit that has been conferred upon him. If the benefit consists simply of a sum of money received by the party from whom restitution is sought, there is no difficulty in determining this amount. If the benefit consists of something else, however, such as services or property, its measurement in terms of money may pose serious problems….</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1">An especially important choice is that between the reasonable value to a party of what he received in terms of what it would have cost him to obtain it from a person in the claimant’s position and the addition to the wealth of that party as measured by the extent to which his property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced. In practice, the first measure is usually based on the market price of such a substitute. Under the rule stated in this Section, the court has considerable discretion in making the choice between these two measures of benefit. Under either choice, the court may properly consider the purposes of the recipient of the benefit when he made the contract, even if those purposes were later frustrated or abandoned.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1"><span class="italic">b. Choice of Measure.</span> The reasonable value to the party against whom restitution is sought (Paragraph (a)) is ordinarily less than the cost to the party seeking restitution, since his expenditures are excluded to the extent that they conferred no benefit. See Comment <span class="italic">a</span> to § 344. Nor can the party against whom restitution is sought reduce the amount for which he may himself be liable by subtracting such expenditures from the amount of the benefit that he has received…. The reasonable value to the party from whom restitution is sought (Paragraph (a)), is, however, usually greater than the addition to his wealth (Paragraph (b)). If this is so, a party seeking restitution for part performance is commonly allowed the more generous measure of reasonable value, unless that measure is unduly difficult to apply, except <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page194" >194</span>when he is in breach (§ 374)…. In the case of services rendered in an emergency or to save life, however, restitution based on addition to wealth will greatly exceed that based on expense saved and recovery is invariably limited to the smaller amount…. In the case of services rendered to a third party as the intended beneficiary of a gift promise, restitution from the promisee based on his enrichment is generally not susceptible of measurement and recovery based on reasonable value is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="secsub1a"><span class="italic">§ 373. Restitution When Other Party Is in Breach.</span></h4>
<p class="list">(1) Subject to the rule stated in Subsection (2), on a breach by nonperformance that gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach or on a repudiation, the injured party is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance.</p>
<p class="list">(2) The injured party has no right to restitution if he has performed all of his duties under the contract and no performance by the other party remains due other than payment of a definite sum of money for that performance.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">C<small>OMMENT</small>:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1">…</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1"><span class="italic">b. When Contract Price Is a Limit.</span> The rule stated in Subsection (1) is subject to an important exception. If, after one party has fully performed his part of the contract, the other party then refuses to pay a definite sum of money that has been fixed as the price for that performance, the injured party is barred from recovery of a greater sum as restitution under the rule stated in Subsection (2). Since he is entitled to recover the price in full together with interest, he has a remedy that protects his expectation interest by giving him the very thing that he was promised. Even if he asserts that the benefit he conferred on the other party exceeds the price fixed by the contract, justice does not require that he have the right to recover this larger sum in restitution. To give him that right would impose on the court the burden of measuring the benefit in terms of money in spite of the fact that this has already been done by the parties themselves when they made their contract…. If, however, the performance to be rendered by the party in breach is something other than the payment of a definite sum in money, this burden is less of an imposition on the court since, even if damages were sought by the injured party, the court would have to measure the value to him of the performance due from the party in breach. The clearest case occurs where the injured party has paid the full price in money for the performance that the party in breach has subsequently failed to render. To <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page195" >195</span>allow restitution of the sum paid in that case imposes no burden of measurement on the court and relieves it of the burden that it would have if damages were awarded of measuring the value to the injured party of the performance due from the party in breach….</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind1"><span class="italic">d. Losing Contracts.</span> An injured party who has performed in part will usually prefer to seek damages based on his expectation interest (§ 347) instead of a sum of money based on his restitution interest because such damages include his net profit and will give him a larger recovery. Even if he cannot prove what his net profit would have been, he will ordinarily seek damages based on his reliance interest (§ 348), since this will compensate him for all of his expenditures, regardless of whether they resulted in a benefit to the party in breach. See Comment <span class="italic">a</span> to § 344. In the case of a contract on which he would have sustained a loss instead of having made a profit, however, his restitution interest may give him a larger recovery than would damages on either basis. The right of the injured party under a losing contract to a greater amount in restitution than he could have recovered in damages has engendered much controversy. The rules stated in this Section give him that right. He is entitled to such recovery even if the contract price is stated in terms of a rate per unit of work and the recovery exceeds that rate. There are, however, two important limitations. The first limitation is one that is applicable to any claim for restitution: the party in breach is liable only to the extent that he has benefitted from the injured party’s performance. If he has, for example, taken advantage of the injured party’s part performance by having the rest of the work completed after his breach, the extent of his benefit is easy to measure in terms of the reasonable value of the injured party’s performance…. If, however, he has abandoned the project and not completed the work, that measurement will be more difficult…. In that situation, the court may exercise its sound discretion in choosing between the two measures stated in § 371. In doing so it will take account of all the circumstances including the observance by the parties of standards of good faith and fair dealing during any negotiations leading up to the rupture of contractual relations (§ 208)….</p>

<p id="sec100" class="sectiona"><b>Mooney v. York Iron Co.</b></p>
<p class="sectionb">Michigan Supreme Court, 1890.</p>
<p class="sectionb">82 Mich. 263, 46 N.W. 376.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ C<small>AHILL</small>, J. The plaintiffs brought an action in justice court to recover an amount claimed to be due them for work and labor performed in sinking a mining shaft for the defendant. The plaintiffs recovered a judgment in justice court, and the defendant appealed, when the plaintiffs again had judgment, and the case is brought to this court on writ of error.</p>
<p class="indent">The case made by the plaintiffs is that they made a contract with defendant through Capt. Florada, who was at the time superintendent of the defendant company, by which they were to sink a shaft 8 by 11 feet, down to the “ledge,” and timber the same up; plaintiffs to furnish everything, and to be paid $10 per foot. They claimed that they sunk the shaft to the “ledge,” and had timbered it to within 8 or 10 inches of the “ledge,” when they were stopped in their work by Capt. Carlin, who, as they claim, had immediate charge of the mining operations for the defendant. They claim the right to recover for the work actually done by them under the <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> on the ground that they were prevented by the defendant, without fault on their part, from performing the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The case was submitted to the jury by the circuit judge upon this theory, and the jury were instructed as follows: “It is the law that if an employer terminates a contract without any fault on the part of the employee or contractor, that then the employee or contractor may sue upon the contract to recover damages, or he may sue in <span class="italic">assumpsit</span> upon the common counts, as they are called—the <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>–to recover what his services were worth. That does not mean what they were worth to the employer. It is the fair value; that is, the value of work and labor. Of course, the main question is first as to whether the contract was performed up to that time by the plaintiffs. If it was not, then the defendant had the right to stop the work, and discharge them, and they could not recover.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now comes the question as to the discharge. That depends upon two witnesses, as I remember the testimony; that is, Capt. Carlin and the plaintiff Mooney. I understand all the testimony there is upon that point is given by these two men. Mooney says that Capt. Carlin “told us to stop and take the timbers up.” Mr. Carlin denies it. The burden of proof is upon the plaintiffs in the case, so that if you find that the contract was performed up to that time by the plaintiffs but still that they were not discharged, but stopped the contract without being discharged, then they cannot recover in this case at all. If that were the case, then the plaintiffs could recover only upon the ground that their work had been of value to the defendant.</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel for defendant objects to that part of the above charge in which the court said “the plaintiffs might recover upon a <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> what their services were <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page197" >197</span>worth; that this does not mean what they were worth to the defendant, but the fair value of the work and labor”; and it is claimed that the true basis of recovery in such cases is not the value of the work and labor, but of the product of the work and labor. We think the circuit judge adopted the correct rule. If the plaintiffs had abandoned the work, without being directed to do so by the defendant, and the defendant had appropriated the work to its own use, the rule contended for by defendant’s counsel would have been correct. That rule was recognized, and clearly stated by the circuit judge in his charge. But where, as in this case, the plaintiffs are prevented from performing the contract, they are entitled to recover if at all what their work and labor is worth, whether it was of value to the defendant or not.</p>
<p class="indent">… The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p id="sec101" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p class="indent">Assume that the ledge to which Mooney was to dig was fifty feet down, so that the contract price was $500 at ten dollars per foot. Further assume that it cost Mooney a uniform amount to dig each foot and that his costs were seven dollars per foot. Finally, assume that there is a market for holes in Michigan in 1890 and that the current price for holes of this sort on the Michigan Hole Exchange, where lots of holes are traded every day, is twelve dollars per foot.</p>
<p class="indent">a. Suppose Mooney never shows up for the job. What would York Iron’s damages be? Would York Iron have a claim for restitution?</p>
<p class="indent">b. Suppose Mooney shows up to do the job, but York won’t let him dig. What are Mooney’s damages? Would Mooney have a claim for restitution?</p>
<p class="indent">c. Suppose instead that Mooney digs down forty feet and then is thrown off the job wrongfully. What are Mooney’s damages? Would Mooney have a claim for restitution? How would it be measured?</p>
<p class="indent">d. Suppose that the contract was a loser for Mooney; that is, the contract price is ten dollars a foot, but his costs turn out to be higher than expected, and it is costing him eleven dollars a foot to dig through heavy clay. After Mooney digs forty feet down, York wrongfully throws him off the job. Now what are Mooney’s damages? What would the restitutionary recovery be?</p>
<p class="indent">e. Now suppose that after digging down forty feet, Mooney walks off the job in frustration but without legal excuse. Would Mooney be able to maintain a successful action for contract damages? Might Mooney have a good claim for restitution? How would that claim be measured? Does Mooney’s recovery depend on whether York completes the project or just lets Mooney’s hole sit there? If Mooney recovers in these circumstances, won’t that encourage people with losing contracts to walk off after partial performance and then sue for restitution?</p>

<p class="sectionb">Alaska Supreme Court, 1988.</p>
<p class="sectionb">750 P.2d 338.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ M<small>ATTHEWS</small>, J.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>F<small>ACTS AND</small> P<small>ROCEEDINGS</small></b></p>
<p class="indent">The decedent, Robert Sparks, Sr., and the plaintiff, Ernie Gustafson, were personal friends and business associates for many years. In 1980 Sparks purchased a one-half interest in the Nome Center Building. Gustafson managed the building for Sparks without charge until Sparks died on March 1, 1981. Thereafter Gustafson continued to manage the building and collect rents on behalf of Sparks, Sr.’s estate, with the knowledge and approval of the executor, Robert Sparks, Jr. Gustafson did not request any compensation for his services.</p>
<p class="indent">Under Gustafson’s management, Nome Center operated at a loss. The Estate deposited $10,000 in a Nome Center account to cover operating expenses, but the amount was not sufficient to meet the necessary costs of insurance, mortgage payments, utility bills, and repairs. Gustafson often paid Nome Center expenses out of his own pocket. Maintenance and remodeling work were performed by Gustafson, using in part his own funds. Although he mailed monthly reports of the Nome Center’s income and expenses, these reports did not include all of his own expenditures.</p>
<p class="indent">In February, 1982, the Estate signed a document entitled “purchase agreement” which indicated that Gustafson had purchased the building from the Estate, and would assume the deed of trust as soon as the purchase details could be worked out. However, no purchase details were ever agreed upon. The Estate sold the building to a third party in February, 1983, and Gustafson ceased to manage the property at that time.</p>
<p class="indent">On July 14, 1983, Gustafson and his business corporation, Nome Business Venture, Inc., filed suit against the Estate and the executor in Nome, claiming that the defendants breached an oral agreement to sell the Nome Center Building to Gustafson. Plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint which further alleged that Gustafson was entitled to recover for funds and services that he expended on the building under a statutory or equitable lien theory. Defendants filed an answer and counterclaimed for an accounting of all monies collected and expended on the building.</p>
<p class="indent">At trial the superior court found that Gustafson had no enforceable lien. The court also concluded that it would be inequitable to allow the Estate to retain the benefits that Gustafson had conferred upon Nome Center at his own expense. The court ordered the Estate to pay Gustafson $65,706.07 in compensation for the services and improvements that he conferred upon the Estate during his two years of managing the Nome Center Building. This appeal followed.</p>

<p class="center_hd"><b>II. D<small>ISCUSSION ON THE</small> M<small>ERITS</small>: U<small>NJUST</small> E<small>NRICHMENT</small></b></p>
<p class="indent">Unjust enrichment exists where the defendant has received a benefit from the plaintiff and it would be inequitable for defendant to retain the benefit without compensating plaintiff for its value. Sparks claims that plaintiffs failed to prove either element of unjust enrichment: first, that the Estate received any benefit from plaintiffs, and second, that if a benefit was received then its retention would be unjust.</p>
<p class="indent">A person confers a benefit upon another if he gives the other some interest in money, land or possessions; performs services beneficial to or at the request of the other; satisfies a debt of the other; or in any way adds to the other’s advantage. In this case Gustafson made substantial repairs and improvements to the Nome Center, provided management services that kept Nome Center operating, and paid debts incurred by Nome Center, all arguably on the Estate’s behalf. There is no question that Gustafson conferred a benefit upon the Estate.</p>
<p class="indent">Even where a person has conferred a benefit upon another, however, he is entitled to compensation only if it would be just and equitable to require compensation under the circumstances. Courts will allow the defendant to retain a benefit without compensating plaintiff in several situations, one of which is relevant to the case at hand: where the benefit was given gratuitously without expectation of payment. Appellants argue that this situation is present in the case before us.</p>
<p class="indent">This court has not yet addressed the circumstances which give rise to a finding of gratuitous intent. A good discussion of this issue in the context of a decedent’s estate can be found in <span class="italic">Kershaw v. Tracy Collins Bank &amp; Trust Co.</span> (Utah 1977). In that case the decedent’s best friend provided a variety of services to the decedent’s widow, including chauffeuring, buying groceries, running errands, and performing minor repair work. The court looked at the extent of the services provided to the widow, the closeness of the relationship between the parties, and the fact that the plaintiff never sought compensation until after the widow died. The court found that the widow had not been unjustly enriched, since plaintiff’s services were not necessary for the widow’s existence and were of the sort which could reasonably be expected from a long time friend.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case there was a similarly close relationship between the plaintiff and the decedent. It appears that Gustafson managed the Nome Center Building for the decedent without requesting compensation, in recognition of many long years of friendship and business association together. At trial, the executor testified that he thought Gustafson would continue to manage the building for two years after Sparks’ death out of the goodness of his heart, without expectation of payment. Gustafson never requested compensation for his services during his tenure as the Nome Center manager for the Estate. The closeness of the parties’ relationship and <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page200" >200</span>Gustafson’s failure to request compensation in a timely manner suggest that Gustafson offered his services to the Estate gratuitously.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the services that Gustafson performed for the Estate were not the sort which one would ordinarily expect to receive from a friend as a mere gratuity. Gustafson spent approximately five hours a day for two years collecting rents for Nome Center, soliciting new tenants, making repairs and improvements, paying utility, insurance and mortgage bills out of his own pocket when rental income fell short of expenses, and performing other general maintenance and management services for the Estate. These are the types of extensive business services for which one would ordinarily expect to be paid. We therefore agree with the trial court that Gustafson’s services were not offered gratuitously.</p>
<p class="indent">Sparks argues that a distinction should be made between remodeling expenses and those which were for maintenance and general management. He argues that the remodeling expenditures were made solely to benefit Gustafson. This argument, however, was not raised below. Indeed, Sparks argued that if Gustafson had established any claim for relief his damages should be limited to $62,706.07. “If the court finds any of Plaintiff’s theories supported by evidence, Defendant’s damage theory [that damages are limited to $62,506.07] is the only correct basis for an award of damages.” The court followed this suggestion, adding only one $3,200 item which is not presently in dispute. Since Sparks’ damage theory was accepted by the trial court (with the exception of $3,200), Sparks has waived his right to contend that a further breakdown of damages should have been made. While “plain error” is an exception to the rule of waiver, it does not exist here. Sparks’ argument that the remodeling expenses did not benefit the Estate is facially incorrect since at least some of the rental income which the Estate received is directly related to the remodeling expenditures.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment of the superior court is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p id="sec103" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. Would the court come to the same conclusion if there were no evidence of a Purchase Agreement between Gustafson and the Sparks Estate?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. Was there a contract to provide services in this case? What if Gustafson had stopped managing the building? Could the Sparks Estate have obtained damages? What if Gustafson had failed to properly maintain the roof and it collapsed under the weight of the first snowfall in 1982?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. In <span class="italic">Chodos v. West Publishing Co.</span>, 292 F.3d 992 (9th Cir. 2002) (<span class="italic">Chodos I</span>), the court faced a claim from Rafael Chodos, a well-regarded California lawyer, who, <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page201" >201</span>pursuant to a standard Author Agreement similar to that in <span class="italic">Freund,</span> p. 124, had labored for 3600 hours over three years on a 1247 page legal treatise that the publisher subsequently determined it would not publish because of weak projected sales and other commercial criteria. The publisher admitted that the quality and literary merit of the treatise were otherwise satisfactory. The court found that the publisher’s termination rights under the Author Agreement were limited to good faith determinations that the work was unworthy of publication for quality or literary reasons, but not commercial considerations. Chodos’s claim for lost future royalties, the only compensation provided for in the Author Agreement, however, was disallowed as speculative. The court nevertheless permitted Chodos to pursue a claim “off the contract” in restitution for the <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> of his services as an author. The Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed a jury award of $300,000 to Chodos on this theory, but rejected Chodos’s claim to be compensated at his standard hourly rate as an attorney for the 3600 hours of work on the manuscript. <span class="italic">Chodos v.

<p id="sec104" class="sectiona"><b>Britton v. Turner</b></p>
<p class="sectionb">New Hampshire Supreme Court of Judicature, 1834.</p>
<p class="sectionb">6 N.H. 481.</p>
<p class="indent">Assumpsit, for work and labor, performed by the plaintiff, in the service of the defendant, from March 9, 1831, to December 27, 1831.</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration contained the common counts, and among them a count in quantum meruit, for the labor, averring it to be worth $100.</p>
<p class="indent">At the trial in the C.C. Pleas, the plaintiff proved the performance of the labor as set forth in the declaration.</p>
<p class="indent">The defense was that it was performed under a special contract; that the plaintiff agreed to work one year, from some time in March, 1831, to March, 1832, and that the defendant was to pay him for said year’s labor the sum of $120; and the defendant offered evidence tending to show that such was the contract under which the work was done. Evidence was also offered to show that the plaintiff left the defendant’s service without his consent, and it was contended by the defendant that the plaintiff had no good cause for not continuing in his employment. There was no evidence offered of any damage arising from the plaintiff’s departure, farther than was to be inferred from his nonfulfillment of the entire contract.</p>
<p class="indent">The court instructed the jury that, if they were satisfied from the evidence that the labor was performed under a contract to labor a year, for the sum of $120, and if <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page202" >202</span>they were satisfied that the plaintiff labored only the time specified in the declaration, and then left the defendant’s service, against his consent, and without any good cause, yet the plaintiff was entitled to recover, under his quantum meruit count, as much as the labor he performed was reasonably worth, and under this direction the jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of $95.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant excepted to the instructions thus given to the jury.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>ARKER</small>, J., delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be assumed that the labor performed by the plaintiff, and for which he seeks to recover a compensation in this action, was commenced under a special contract to labor for the defendant the term of one year, for the sum of $120, and that the plaintiff has labored but a portion of that time, and has voluntarily failed to complete the entire contract.</p>
<p class="indent">It is clear then, that he is not entitled to recover upon the contract itself, because the service, which was to entitle him to the sum agreed upon, has never been performed.</p>
<p class="indent">But the question arises: Can the plaintiff, under these circumstances, recover a reasonable sum for the service he has actually performed, under the count in quantum meruit? Upon this, and questions of a similar nature, the decisions to be found in the books are not easily reconciled. It has been held, upon contracts of this kind for labor to be performed at a specified price, that the party who voluntarily fails to fulfil the contract by performing the whole labor contracted for, is not entitled to recover anything for the labor actually performed, however much he may have done toward the performance; and this has been considered the settled rule of law upon this subject.</p>
<p class="indent">That such rule in its operation may be very unequal, not to say unjust, is apparent. A party who contracts to perform certain specified labor, and who breaks his contract in the first instance, without any attempt to perform it, can only be made liable to pay the damages which the other party has sustained by reason of such nonperformance, which in many instances may be trifling; whereas a party who in good faith has entered upon the performance of his contract, and nearly completed it, and then abandoned the further performance,—although the other party has had the full benefit of all that has been done, and has perhaps sustained no actual damage,—is in fact subjected to a loss of all which has been performed, in the nature of damages for the nonfulfilment of the remainder, upon the technical rule, that the contract must be fully performed in order to [support] a recovery of any part of the compensation.</p>
<p class="indent">By the operation of this rule, then, the party who attempts performance may be placed in a much worse situation than he who wholly disregards his contract, and<span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page203">203</span> the other party may receive much more, by the breach of the contract, than the injury which he has sustained by such breach, and more than he could be entitled to were he seeking to recover damages by an action.</p>
<p class="indent">The case before us presents an illustration. Had the plaintiff in this case never entered upon the performance of his contract, the damage could not probably have been greater than some small expense and trouble incurred in procuring another to do the labor which he had contracted to perform. But having entered upon the performance, and labored nine and a half months, the value of which labor to the defendant as found by the jury is $95, if the defendant can succeed in this defence, he in fact receives nearly five sixths of the value of a whole year’s labor, by reason of the breach of contract by the plaintiff, a sum not only utterly disproportionate to any probable, not to say possible damage which could have resulted from the neglect of the plaintiff to continue the remaining two and a half months, but altogether beyond any damage which could have been recovered by the defendant, had the plaintiff done nothing towards the fulfilment of his contract.</p>
<p class="indent">… It is said that where a party contracts to perform certain work, and to furnish materials, as, for instance, to build a house, and the work is done, but with some variations from the mode prescribed by the contract, yet if the other party has the benefit of the labor and materials he should be bound to pay so much as they are reasonably worth….</p>
<p class="indent">Those cases are not to be distinguished, in principle, from the present, unless it be in the circumstance that where the party has contracted to furnish materials, and do certain labor, as to build a house in a specified manner, if it is not done according to the contract, the party for whom it is built may refuse to receive it,—elect to take no benefit from what has been performed; and therefore if he does receive, he shall be bound to pay the value—whereas in a contract for labor, merely, from day to day, the party is continually receiving the benefit of the contract under an expectation that it will be fulfilled, and cannot upon the breach of it have an election to refuse to receive what has been done, and thus discharge himself from payment. But we think this difference in the nature of the contracts does not justify the application of a different rule in relation to them.</p>
<p class="indent">The party who contracts for labor merely, for a certain period, does so with full knowledge that he must, from the nature of the case, be accepting part performance from day to day, if the other party commences the performance, and with knowledge also that the other may eventually fail of completing the entire term.</p>
<p class="indent">If under such circumstances he actually receives a benefit from the labor performed, over and above the damage occasioned by the failure to complete, there is as much reason why he should pay the reasonable worth of what has thus been done for his benefit, as there is when he enters and occupies the house which has been built for him, but not according to the stipulations of the contract, and which he <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page204" >204</span>perhaps enters, not because he is satisfied with what has been done, but because circumstances compel him to accept it such as it is, that he should pay for the value of the house.</p>
<p class="indent">… If then the party stipulates in the outset to receive part performance from time to time, with a knowledge that the whole may not be completed, we see no reason why he should not equally be holden to pay for the amount of value received, as where he afterwards takes the benefit of what has been done, with a knowledge that the whole which was contracted for has not been performed. In neither case has the contract been performed. In neither can an action be sustained on the original contract. In both the party has assented to receive what is done. The only difference is, that in the one case the assent is prior, with a knowledge that all may not be performed, in the other it is subsequent, with a knowledge that the whole has not been accomplished.</p>
<p class="indent">We have no hesitation in holding that the same rule should be applied to both classes of cases, especially as the operation of the rule will be to make the party who has failed to fulfill his contract liable to such amount of damages as the other party has sustained, instead of subjecting him to an entire loss for a partial failure, and thus making the amount received in many cases wholly disproportionate to the injury. It is as “hard upon the plaintiff to preclude him from recovering at all, because he has failed as to part of his entire undertaking,” where his contract is to labor for a certain period, as it can be in any other description of contract, provided the defendant has received a benefit and value from the labor actually performed.</p>
<p class="indent">We hold, then, that where a party undertakes to pay upon a special contract for the performance of labor, or the furnishing of materials, he is not to be charged upon such special agreement until the money is earned according to the terms of it, and where the parties have made an express contract the law will not imply and raise a contract different from that which the parties have entered into, except upon some further transaction between the parties.</p>
<p class="indent">In case of a failure to perform such special contract, by the default of the party contracting to do the service, if the money is not due by the terms of the special agreement he is not entitled to recover for his labor, or for the materials furnished, unless the other party receives what has been done, or furnished, and upon the whole case derives a benefit from it.</p>
<p class="indent">But if, where a contract is made of such a character, a party actually receives labor, or materials, and thereby derives a benefit and advantage, over and above the damage which has resulted from the breach of the contract by the other party, the labor actually done, and the value received, furnish a new consideration, and the law thereupon raises a promise to pay to the extent of the reasonable worth of such excess. This may be considered as making a new case, one not within the original <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page205" >205</span>agreement, and the party is entitled to “recover on his new case, for the work done, not as agreed, but yet accepted by the defendant.” 1 Dane’s Abr. 224.</p>
<p class="indent">If on such failure to perform the whole, the nature of the contract be such that the employer can reject what has been done, and refuse to receive any benefit from the part performance, he is entitled so to do, and in such case is not liable to be charged, unless he has before assented to and accepted of what has been done, however much the other party may have done towards the performance. He has in such case received nothing, and having contracted to receive nothing but the entire matter contracted for, he is not bound to pay, because his express promise was only to pay on receiving the whole, and having actually received nothing the law cannot and ought not to raise an implied promise to pay. But where the party receives value—takes and uses the materials, or has advantage from the labor, he is liable to pay the reasonable worth of what he has received. And the rule is the same whether it was received and accepted by the assent of the party prior to the breach, under a contract by which, from its nature, he was to receive labor from time to time until the completion of the whole contract; or whether it was received and accepted by an assent subsequent to the performance of all which was in fact done. If he received it under such circumstances as precluded him from rejecting it afterward, that does not alter the case—it has still been received by his assent.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact we think the technical reasoning, that the performance of the whole labor is a condition precedent, and the right to recover anything dependent upon it; that the contract being entire there can be no apportionment; and that there being an express contract no other can be implied, even upon the subsequent performance of service,—is not properly applicable to this species of contract, where a beneficial service has been actually performed; for we have abundant reason to believe, that the general understanding of the community is that the hired laborer shall be entitled to compensation for the service actually performed, though he does not continue the entire term contracted for, and such contracts must be presumed to be made with reference to that understanding, unless an express stipulation shows the contrary.</p>
<p class="indent">Where a beneficial service has been performed and received, therefore, under contracts of this kind, the mutual agreements cannot be considered as going to the whole of the consideration, so as to make them mutual conditions the one precedent to the other, without a specific proviso to that effect.</p>
<p class="indent">It is easy, if parties so choose, to provide by an express agreement that nothing shall be earned, if the laborer leaves his employer without having performed the whole service contemplated, and then there can be no pretence for a recovery if he voluntarily deserts the service before the expiration of the time.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page206" >206</div>
<p class="indent">The amount, however, for which the employer ought to be charged, where the laborer abandons his contract, is only the reasonable worth or the amount of advantage he receives upon the whole transaction; and, in estimating the value of the labor, the contract price for the service cannot be exceeded.</p>
<p class="indent">If a person makes a contract fairly he is entitled to have it fully performed; and if this is not done he is entitled to damages. He may maintain a suit to recover the amount of damages sustained by the nonperformance.</p>
<p class="indent">The benefit and advantage which the party takes by the labor, therefore, is the amount of value which he receives, if any, after deducting the amount of damage; and if he elects to put this in defense he is entitled so to do, and the implied promise which the law will raise, in such case, is to pay such amount of the stipulated price for the whole labor, as remains after deducting what it would cost to procure a completion of the residue of the service, and also any damage which has been sustained by reason of the nonfulfillment of the contract. If in such case it be found that the damages are equal to or greater than the amount of the labor performed, so that the employer, having a right to the full performance of the contract, has not upon the whole case received a beneficial service, the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
<p class="indent">This rule, by binding the employer to pay the value of the service he actually receives, and the laborer to answer to damages where he does not complete the entire contract, will leave no temptation to the former to drive the laborer from his service, near the close of his term, by ill treatment, in order to escape from payment, nor to the latter to desert his service before the stipulated time, without a sufficient reason; and it will in most instances settle the whole controversy in one action, and prevent a multiplicity of suits and cross-actions.</p>
<p class="indent">… Judgment on the verdict.</p>
<p id="sec105" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. In early agricultural economies, labor contracts were commonly seasonal or annual. Both the worker and the farmer only see cash at harvest time when the crop is sold. The worker must stay on the job through harvest to earn cash compensation. The contract is entire in the sense that it is a single contract for service for the whole agricultural season from planting through harvest, not a series of divisible claims for each hour, week, or month worked. Modern labor codes create a statutory claim for the worker to compensation for time worked before quitting. This case imaginatively expanded restitutionary concepts to work social justice a century before those labor codes were enacted and before the industrial revolution caused labor markets generally to shift away from annual or seasonal contracts to an employment-at-will structure. For a fascinating historical look at how these legal, social and economic <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page207" >207</span>changes were presaged by <span class="italic">Britton,</span> see Robert W. Gordon, Britton v. Turner<span class="italic">: A Signpost on the Crooked Road to “Freedom” in the Employment Contract</span>, 26 H<small>AWAII</small> L. R<small>EV</small>. 423 (2004) <span class="italic">expanded and reprinted in</span> C<small>ONTRACT</small> S<small>TORIES</small> (Baird, ed. Foundation Press 2007).</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. We aren’t told in this case what kind of labor Britton performed. The jury returned a verdict that awarded him very close to the pro rata portion of the annual contract rate for the nine months worked. But one imagines that if we are talking about agricultural labor in New England that almost all the employee’s effort would be expended between April and October and in particular in August and September during the Fall harvest. Should that affect the proper restitutionary recovery? Justice Parker limits restitutionary recovery to the amount that the injured employer benefitted over and beyond the damages suffered by the employee’s breach in quitting in the middle of the job. How would the worker show that value other than by hours of labor expended in his employer’s service? Is it enough for the worker to show that he came to work every day, or would he have to show that his work was productive?</p>

<p class="list">(1) Subject to the rule stated in Subsection (2), if a party justifiably refuses to perform on the ground that his remaining duties of performance have been discharged by the other party’s breach, the party in breach is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred by way of part performance or reliance in excess of the loss that he has caused by his own breach.</p>
<p class="list">(2) To the extent that, under the manifested assent of the parties, a party’s performance is to be retained in the case of breach, that party is not entitled to restitution if the value of the performance as liquidated damages is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the difficulties of proof of loss.</p>

<p class="blockquote_ind1">A party who intentionally furnishes services or builds a building that is materially different from what he promised is properly regarded as having acted officiously and not in part performance of his promise and will be denied recovery on that ground even if his performance was of some benefit to the other party.

<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, 1991.</p>
<p class="sectionb">940 F.2d 1260.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ F<small>ERNANDEZ</small>, J. This case presents a clash of principles at the interface between the law of expressed contracts and the law of quasi contracts. Here, Cal State Electric, Inc. (CSE) entered into a contract with Palmer Construction, Inc. (Palmer). Palmer breached its contract, and after a trial the district court found that CSE should pay damages and attorneys fees to Palmer. CSE appealed the final judgment arising out of that somewhat jarring result. We agree that the judgment is in error and reverse.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>B<small>ACKGROUND</small> F<small>ACTS</small></b></p>
<p class="indent">CSE entered into a prime contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct the STS Power Plant at Vandenburg Air Force Base in California. CSE then entered into a contract with Palmer in which a portion of the work was subcontracted to the latter entity. The contract price for Palmer’s work was to be $220,162. Due to agreed extra work, an additional $14,975 was added to the contract price for a total of $235,137.</p>
<p class="indent">Palmer commenced work but, after completing a portion of the job, Palmer breached. There is no doubt about that. By the time of the breach Palmer had supplied some goods and services which the district court found to have a value of $204,845.26. Against the sum, CSE had already paid Palmer a total of $114,758.98, and after Palmer’s breach CSE was required to expend the further sum of $126,673.56 in order to complete the work that Palmer had contracted to do.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page209" >209</div>
<p class="indent">CSE had, thus, paid out a total of $241,432.54 in order to obtain a job that it had contracted to get from Palmer at a price of $235,137. Therefore, CSE had suffered damages in the amount of $6,295.54. The district court so found.</p>
<p class="indent">However, rather than leaving matters where they stood, the district court went on to reflect on the fact that since the value of Palmer’s work was $204,845.26 and it had only received $114,758.98, it was entitled to reimbursement for the rest of those services, less the “damage” done to CSE. The result of that calculation, after also giving CSE prejudgment interest of $1,468.88, was a net sum due to Palmer of $82,321.86 plus attorneys fees.</p>
<p class="indent">Not surprisingly, CSE, the innocent party, expressed its chagrin at a result that required it to pay additional sums to Palmer plus attorneys fees. It argues that this was caused by a misapplication of legal principles. We agree.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>D<small>ISCUSSION</small></b></p>
<p class="left_hd"><b>A. The Measure and Allocation of Damages.</b></p>
<p class="indent">The question which faces us on this appeal is one of some jurisprudential complexity. It has engaged the attention of commentators for many years. As a matter of pure contract law it is generally true that if two individuals enter into a contract and one breaches, the breaching party cannot obtain a recovery from the innocent party. Rather, if the innocent party has suffered, a recovery against the party in breach is generally accorded. In building contracts “[t]he measure of damages * * * is the reasonable cost * * * to finish the work in accordance with the contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, if the breaching party has conferred a benefit upon the innocent party rather than a detriment, it would unjustly enrich the innocent party and unduly punish the breaching party if the latter received nothing for its services. Quasi contract principles will supply the remedy for that.</p>
<p class="indent">These policies appear to conflict to some extent, so anyone who considers them must reconcile their opposing tendencies. When faced with these propositions, the commentators have resolved them by stating that the breaching party is entitled to the reasonable value of its services less any damages caused by the breach. They have added that the breaching party should not, in any event, be able to recover more than the contract price, or perhaps even a ratable part of that contract price. Williston puts it as follows: The true measure of quasi contractual recovery, where the performance is incomplete but readily remediable, is the unpaid contract price less the cost of completion and other additional harm to the defendant except that it must never exceed the benefit actually received by him. This is the net benefit by which the defendant is enriched.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page210" >210</div>
<p class="indent">While this phraseology is somewhat more complex, it can readily be seen that the effect is to preclude a recovery by the breaching party which will cause the innocent party to pay more than the contract price itself.<sup><b><a id="fn_30" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-30" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></b></sup> The Restatement is in accord with this approach, for while it, too, allows for recovery for part performance, it indicates that the amount of that recovery is not only limited to the extent that the innocent party’s gain exceeded its loss, but is also limited to no more than a ratable portion of the total contract price.</p>
<p class="indent">It is interesting to observe that treatise illustrations of the application of these principles demonstrate that the innocent party never winds up paying a total that is more than the contract price itself. That is sensible. Were it otherwise, there would be a powerful inducement to breach rather than complete any contract which did not turn out to be profitable. By doing so, the ultimate loss of the bargain would be shifted from the breaching party to the innocent party, which is precisely what would occur in the case at hand if the district court’s judgment stands.</p>
<p class="indent">Palmer has referred us to cases from our and other circuits but not one of them stands for the proposition that an innocent party must pay more than the contract price for the goods or services it sought.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, if the breaching party were permitted to recover an amount that leaves the innocent party paying more than the contract price for the goods and services contracted for, that would cause an increase in the loss to the innocent party on account of the breach and would offset the additional amount demanded by the breaching party. However, no such paraphrastic principles are needed if the cost to the innocent party for the goods and services contracted for is limited to the contract price itself. The breaching party would then be required to pay damages for excess costs imposed upon the innocent party.</p>
<p class="indent">It is, therefore, apparent that the district court erred when it offset the damages to CSE against the raw value of the work done by Palmer, with the result that CSE was ordered to absorb the loss that Palmer incurred by entering into a contract which turned out to be unprofitable to it. Instead, when it became apparent that Palmer’s breach actually cost CSE $6,295.54 more than the contract price, CSE should have been awarded its damages and Palmer should have recovered nothing.<sup><b><a id="fn_31" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-31" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></b></sup></p>

<p class="left_hd"><b>B. Attorneys Fees.</b></p>
<p class="indent">The contract between CSE and Palmer provided for an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party. Given that, we apply the law of California to the contract. That law approves of the enforcement of attorneys fee provisions. Cal.Civ.Code § 1717. The district court recognized that but, because it considered Palmer to be the prevailing party, fees were awarded to Palmer. In light of our decision on the merits, that was an error. On the contrary, fees should have been awarded to CSE. On remand, the amount of those fees must be determined.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>C<small>ONCLUSION</small></b></p>
<p class="indent">It is possible to syncretize the principles which require people to carry out their contracts and those which prevent people from unjustly retaining benefits conferred upon them. In other words it is possible to reach a just result in cases which involve both principles. We hold that where, as here, the innocent party has paid more than the contract price for the goods and services ordered from the breaching party, the innocent party may recover the overage from the breaching party. The breaching party may not obtain a quasi contractual recovery from the innocent party. In short, the innocent party is not unjustly enriched when it receives what it bargained for and pays no more than the contract price.</p>
<p class="indent">CSE is therefore entitled to recover the sum of $6,295.24 plus prejudgment interest of $1,478.88 from Palmer. CSE is also entitled to recover attorneys fees and costs for its litigation expenses in the district court, as well as its costs on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ R<small>EINHARDT</small>, J., concurring:</p>
<p class="indent">I concur in Judge Fernandez’s fine opinion harmonizing various principles of law. However, I do not think the problem is nearly as complicated as it appears. All that is required is a little common sense.</p>
<p class="indent">In the rush of dealing with an overwhelming daily calendar, the district judge made a simple error, as we all do from time to time. She could have applied the two formulas that she utilized and reached the right result. The error occurred because she applied them in the wrong order. These things happen.</p>
<p class="indent">Conceptually, it is easy to see the error that results when the damages formula is applied first and the quantum meruit formula second. Under that approach, the damages included in the damage formula are not the total damages CSE will incur—they fail to include the quantum meruit payment, which has not yet been calculated, but which it will be required to pay. Thus, if both formulas are to be utilized, CSE’s damages cannot properly be determined until after the quantum meruit calculation is performed. Otherwise, we may end up, as we did here, with the non-breaching party having to pay more than the contract price.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page212" >212</div>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, when the quantum meruit theory is applied first, we determine at the outset that Palmer would be entitled to an additional payment of $90,086.28 for the work actually performed. If we then required that the additional amount be paid, Palmer’s total payment would be $204,845.26. Instead, however, we proceed to step 2—the determination of CSE’s actual damages. We then find that if CSE is required to pay Palmer the unpaid amount of $90,086.28, and thus the total amount of $204,845.26, the total cost to CSE for the job would be $331,521.82—since CSE was also required to pay a third party the sum of $126,673.56 to finish the job. Because the contract price was only $235,137.00, the damages to CSE would be $96,384.82. However, we next subtract from CSE’s damages the $90,086.28 that it theoretically owes Palmer in quantum meruit (but need not pay because it is less than Palmer owes). As a result, we find that CSE’s actual damages are reduced to the correct amount—$6,295.54. Voilà!</p>
<p class="indent">All this mathematical exercise proves is that if the district judge had applied the two theories in the proper order, she would have come to the correct result. Thus express contract law and quantum meruit doctrines can be harmonized and live together happily ever after.</p>
<p class="indent">Judge Fernandez’s learned approach certainly provides a more intellectual explanation of clashing legal principles. It also provides a simpler and preferable method of calculating damages. The only purpose of this concurrence is to show that from a practical and mathematical standpoint the two legal principles discussed in Judge Fernandez’s opinion are not in conflict.</p>
<p class="indent">The elementary rules that emerge from both of our analyses are relatively simple. When the party performing the work breaches the contract, it may nevertheless recover all or a portion of the value of the services it has actually rendered, but only under certain circumstances. The breaching party may not recover any amount which, when added to the amount previously paid it, and the amount paid or owing to any party whose services are used to complete the job, would cause the contract price to be exceeded. As Judge Fernandez’s opinion clearly states, the contract price represents a ceiling on the amount the non-breaching party may be required to pay—in toto. Similarly, regardless of the value of the work performed by the breaching party, if the amount the non-breaching party must pay to a third party to finish the job, when added to the amount it has already paid to the breaching party, exceeds the contract price, the non-breaching party may recover the excess amount from the breaching party as damages. Thus, depending on the amount already paid the breaching party, the value of the labors it has performed, and the amount required to finish the job, the same breach may result in a recovery by either the breaching or non-breaching party. Who recovers is not a function of who breaches—what matters is who has already paid how much to whom for what.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page213" >213</div>
<p class="indent">Finally, I want to emphasize that it is not necessary to utilize the two-step process illustrated at the beginning of this separate opinion. One step will do. However, all the figures must be calculated first. It will then be possible to apply the applicable legal principles to that set of figures and determine who owes how much to whom.</p>
<p id="sec108" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. Note the apparent confusion judges experience in computing contract damages and <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>. Absurdly, the trial judge became sufficiently confused to reach the conclusion that the non-breaching party should be required to pay $323,754.40 ($241,432.54 in payments to contractors plus $82,321.86 “quantum meruit”) to get the job done (even though the total contract price was $235,137) and be required to pay the defaulting subcontractor’s attorney’s fees to boot! Part of the problem here is that many of those who go to law school and go on to become judges are arithmetically challenged. Part of the problem is that the judges are trying to juggle damages and restitutionary relief in one calculation.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. In this case the plaintiff, Palmer, was clearly in breach, and the court found that its recovery should be limited to “the contract price, or perhaps a ratable part of that contract price.” Suppose that Palmer was not the breaching party and that, despite the problems with this job, it stuck to its promise and carried the project almost to completion at a cost of over $350,000 before CSE threw it off the job. In that circumstance should the contract price be a ceiling on Palmer’s claim to recover the reasonable value of its performance? <span class="italic">See</span> Note, pp. 190-195.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. Note that the court awarded CSE attorney’s fees. The usual “American rule” is that each party must bear its own attorney’s fees. But the American rule has been changed by statute in some situations, notably in certain civil rights cases under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Moreover, many contracts provide that the prevailing party is entitled to collect its attorney’s fees from the breaching party in any action on the contract. Attorney’s fees may be very substantial indeed and must have greatly exceeded the $6,295.54 in damages ultimately awarded in <span class="italic">Palmer Construction</span>. When a party in breach successfully persuades a court that it is entitled to compensation despite its breach, should it be awarded attorney’s fees as the prevailing party under a contractual attorney’s fees provision in a contract which it has itself breached? In this case the ultimate outcome was determined by recognizing substantial claims each side had against the other. In such a case how does a court determine who the prevailing party is?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>4</b>. Plaintiffs in restitution that are not breaching parties are entitled to more generous damage rules than the plaintiff in <span class="italic">Palmer Construction.</span> When, in relatively rare cases, restitution is measured by the defendant’s benefit rather than the plaintiff’s <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page214" >214</span>loss, plaintiffs may recover an element of profit. More commonly, however, plaintiff’s restitutionary recovery is measured by the value that the plaintiff gave. D<small>AN</small> B. D<small>OBBS</small>, R<small>EMEDIES</small>: D<small>AMAGES</small>, E<small>QUITY</small>, R<small>ESTITUTION</small> § 12.1 (2d ed. 1993). The traditional rule disallows recovery of profits in <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> measured in this way, although all direct and indirect costs, including “overhead,” may properly form part of the recovery. The line between profits and costs can often be very fuzzy. In practice, “profits” may sometimes be awarded in recognition of the fact that market values may include an element of profit for the seller or as a surrogate for indirect costs that may be difficult to quantify otherwise. <span class="italic">Aniero Concrete Co. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co.</span>, 301 F. Supp. 2d 302 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“Under a <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span> claim, a building contractor may recover its actual job costs for work, labor and services performed and material furnished, plus an allowance for overhead and profit.”). <span class="italic">See also U.S. ex rel.

<p class="sectionb">California Court of Appeal, 1989.</p>
<p class="sectionb">209 Cal.App.3d 1359, 257 Cal.Rptr. 816.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ S<small>ONENSHINE</small>, J. Wood Dimension, Inc. (WDI), appeals an adverse judgment awarding L. Dale Watson $155,955.85 in damages plus interest, costs and attorney fees….</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>I</b></p>
<p class="indent">WDI manufactures stereo speakers for resale by sound system companies. A major customer for several years, Fisher Corporation was an enormous asset, its orders accounting for 30 to 50 percent of WDI’s business. Fisher ceased purchasing from WDI in early 1982. The loss was a serious financial detriment for WDI; regaining Fisher as a customer, which it was unable to do by itself, was of vital importance.</p>
<p class="indent">Gene Hedlund, president of WDI, and Dale Watson had known each other for many years. In early 1983, Hedlund’s desire to reacquire Fisher’s business surfaced in conversation with Watson. Watson was socially acquainted with Ira Horon, Fisher’s general manager and vice president.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page215" >215</div>
<p class="indent">The possibility arose of utilizing Watson’s relationship with Horon to reacquire Fisher’s business. WDI might indeed double its production if Fisher were to require the same volume of components as it had earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">Realizing the potential if Watson were successful, WDI originally offered him five percent of all Fisher orders. However, as conceded by the parties, they eventually orally agreed upon a three percent commission.</p>
<p class="indent">WDI and Watson were unable to agree on specific terms for a written version of their agreement, in particular the termination provision. When Hedlund announced, “I wouldn’t cheat you out of your commission—Let’s shake hands,” they did just that and agreed a writing was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Horon came to Palm Springs approximately once a month for relaxation. Watson frequently met him at the airport and joined him for golf and dinner. Pursuant to his agreement with Hedlund, Watson was to maintain these activities, generally wining and dining Horon with a view to introducing him to Hedlund at the propitious moment. All went well and, in April, the [alliance] was cemented; Fisher again became a customer of WDI. Watson continued to entertain Horon and to collect his three percent commission on Fisher orders through 1983.</p>
<p class="indent">In early 1984, WDI unilaterally attempted to reduce Watson’s commission to two percent and, on May 15, Watson was summarily terminated. Watson’s friendship with Horon endured until the latter’s death in January 1985; his commissions did not. Fisher continued to place orders with WDI, accounting for almost $10,000,000 in business to WDI through July 1985.</p>
<p class="indent">Watson filed a complaint for damages based on oral contract, open book account, quantum meruit, and fraud. At trial, the court indicated it would probably be necessary to appoint a referee to assess the voluminous accounting records should a determination of commissions due after date of termination become necessary. Evidence was presented on liability first, although the court later announced it would not rule on the issue until after receipt of the referee’s report. Extensive argument ensued concerning the “cutoff” date applicable for payment of commissions to Watson. The court ordered additional briefing and set another hearing date.</p>
<p class="indent">Thereafter, the court appointed Judicial Arbitration Service to examine the relevant documents and to make specified determinations. Watson had compiled, from the WDI invoices, a listing of all Fisher invoices from April 1983 through July 1985, including total dollar amounts, commissions due to Watson, and amounts received against those totals. Hedlund objected to those documents being included in the referee’s “packet.” The court stated, “Then I’ll revise my ruling. Just provide the invoices and the other records which you have produced to the referee.”</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page216" >216</div>
<p class="indent">The referee held a hearing, examined the records and produced his report, which embraced the summaries presented by Watson. He found $241,314.34 due and owing to Watson through July 15, 1985. This amount was the cumulative total of the monthly commissions payable to Watson beginning on the date of his termination.</p>
<p class="indent">Following receipt of the referee’s report, the court entertained argument, accepted a further brief from WDI, and took the matter under submission. In its statement of decision, the court awarded Watson $155,955.84, the amount appearing on the referee’s report as cumulative commissions due as of December 15, 1984. The court found the parties agreed to an employment relationship requiring Watson to “regain the previously lost Fisher account for [WDI] in exchange for 3 percent of the sales.” The attempt to reduce their arrangement to writing, the failure to agree on termination provisions, and the eventual “handshake” treatment of the dilemma were outlined. The court then stated: “Absent an agreement on termination and attendant compensation, the Court has concluded that under the circumstances of this case, plaintiff is entitled to the reasonable value of the services he performed.” The statement noted there was no discussion of reduction of the percent to be paid, the length of time the commission would be paid, or when it would be paid, i.e., “on orders placed, orders shipped or orders paid. The only testimony bearing on the subject was to the effect that orders were anticipated by defendants up to four months prior to receipt.”</p>
<p class="indent">In determining the reasonable value of Watson’s services, the court weighed the factors favoring each party. It then concluded awarding commissions through December 15, 1984, provided Watson “with reasonable compensation for placing the account with Wood Dimension and yet does not compensate him beyond a point when he could no longer influence placement of the account.” WDI’s motion for new trial was denied.</p>
<p class="noindent">…</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>III</b></p>
<p class="indent">There is no dispute the parties had a valid oral agreement for a three percent commission to Watson on all Fisher orders. However, there was no meeting of the minds regarding compensation at the time of a cessation of Watson’s relationship with WDI; because they could not agree on a termination plan, they essentially ignored the possibility. When the possibility became a reality, there was no formula for terminating the right to commissions as well as the employment.</p>
<p class="indent">WDI objects to any award of commissions based on sales made to Fisher after Watson’s termination. Watson argues because he was the procuring cause of the Fisher involvement with WDI, he is essentially entitled to commissions for the life of that relationship. Recognizing the inequity inherent in either extreme, the court <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page217" >217</span>balanced the factors favoring each party and awarded post-termination commissions for a reasonable period of time based on quantum meruit.</p>
<p class="indent">Although California sanctions the payment of commissions, after termination and pursuant to an oral agreement where the salesperson is the procuring cause of a particular sale, we are not cited to a California case dealing with the precise issue presented here. Watson was not the usual commissioned salesperson; he did not solicit customers or place orders for specific products. His value to WDI was his relationship with Horon and the possibility of reacquiring and maintaining the lucrative Fisher business. Thus, it is the business relationship in its entirety which Watson delivered to WDI, not merely one or more orders.</p>
<p class="indent">Federal appellate courts have relied on quantum meruit to find that one who procures an ongoing business relationship, as opposed to single order transactions, is entitled to compensation for a “reasonable” time after termination. In <span class="italic">U.S. Controls Corp. v. Windle</span> (7th Cir.1975), Windle met with two other men, Rose and Schantz, to discuss forming a new business. Windle had important connections at Whirlpool Corporation to whom he introduced the other two men. Rose and Schantz incorporated U.S. Controls and, without notice to Windle, eventually designed and marketed an item desired by Whirlpool and for which it issued purchase orders. The court awarded Windle reasonable compensation for his earlier services on the basis of quantum meruit. Because the majority of the U.S. Controls business was furnishing its products to Whirlpool, the court examined the profits over a period of time and awarded two and one-half percent of those profits for two years. The reviewing court agreed the majority of U.S. Control’s business arose from “initial contacts and introductions” made by Windle; and Windle was entitled to reasonable compensation for his services. “Further, the trial court limited Windle’s compensation to the sales for the first two years. This appears to have been a reasonable cutoff date, although Controls had additional sales * * *.”</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Richer v. Khoury Bros., Inc</span>. (7th Cir.1965), the court determined “[p]laintiff as the procuring cause of the sales, under the agreement of the parties * * * [was] entitled to commissions notwithstanding the fact that the sales were made or consummated subsequent to the termination of the plaintiff’s services.” There, plaintiff induced certain mail order companies to insert descriptions of his employer’s furniture and then received commissions on orders from the catalogue. After he had procured advertisements in several yet-to-be issued catalogues, he was terminated. The court found him entitled to commissions through the life of the catalogues.</p>
<p class="indent">In each instance, it was necessary to compensate plaintiff for a reasonable period of time beyond his termination or alliance with the defendant. And it mattered not whether the plaintiff personally obtained or “wrote” the orders. That is clearly what the court attempted to accomplish here. It considered the earlier and devastating <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page218" >218</span>loss of the Fisher account, WDI’s strong desire to reinstate the account and demonstrated inability to do so itself, Watson’s relationship with Horon which he used for WDI’s advantage, and WDI’s realization of over $9,000,000 in new business after Watson delivered the Fisher account. On the other side of the balance was WDI’s retention of the account without assistance from Watson coupled with the death of Horon in January 1985, removing his ability to influence Fisher. The court concluded Watson was entitled to compensation after termination until mid-December 1984. We find the quantum meruit standard applied by the court eminently fair.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to WDI’s contention, use of the commission totals calculated at three percent was not an impermissible use of a contract term for quantum meruit recovery. The court may consider the price agreed upon by the parties “as a criterion in ascertaining the reasonable value of services performed.”</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, the amount of the damages relates to the three percent commission agreed upon, but only in the context of what the reasonable value of Watson’s services was to WDI for procuring the WDI/Fisher relationship. The reasonable value of those services was not a daily dollar amount for taking Horon golfing—it was the value of the benefit received by WDI. “California law allows evidence of the value of a benefit conferred to prove reasonable value.”<sup><b><a id="fn_32" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-32" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></b></sup> And evidence of the benefit to WDI was voluminous—regaining and continuing to receive Fisher’s business which accounted for up to one-half of WDI’s production and almost $10,000,000 through July 1985….</p>

<p class="center_hd"><b>VI</b></p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>W<small>ATSON</small>’<small>S</small> A<small>PPEAL</small></b></p>
<p class="indent">Watson argues he should have been awarded, at a minimum, three percent of the orders generated from Fisher through the entire accounting period, i.e., through July 1985, because he was the “procuring cause” of the ongoing relationship established between Fisher and WDI. He suggests we modify the judgment to reflect this amount or, in the alternative, remand the matter to the trial judge and/or a referee for this determination.<sup><b><a id="fn_33" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-33" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></b></sup></p>

<p class="indent">As discussed in Section III, <span class="italic">ante</span>, we agree the compensation awarded was reasonable under the circumstances. The trial court strived for a fair determination of the “cutoff” point—that point in time when Watson no longer had any influence over Fisher’s procurement policies and Fisher’s continued reordering, while set in motion by Watson, would depend upon WDI’s product and service.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment affirmed. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>
<p id="sec110" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. The uncertainty in this case did not concern the sales that formed the basis of the claim for commissions. The referee examined voluminous records and calculated WDI’s sales to Fisher quite precisely. The uncertainty concerned the term of the agreement between the parties, that is, how long Watson was to receive a commission on WDI’s sales to Fisher. Did the parties intend that Watson would collect commissions so long as Fisher ordered, so long as Watson played golf with Fisher’s general manager, or so long as Fisher’s orders were fairly traceable to Watson’s efforts? If the parties failed to reach agreement on this crucial matter, what can the court do?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. In what sense is the court’s decision here one in <span class="italic">quantum meruit</span>? Can three percent of the revenues from the Fisher business be the fair market value of Watson’s “services”? Is playing golf and happily sharing meals with your buddy “worth” upwards of $300,000? Is awarding Watson this sum placing the parties back in the position they were in before making this contract, or is it the financial equivalent of performance?</p>

<p class="indent">If contract remedies produce unacceptably low recovery courts may sometimes label the matter a “tort” and then award damages they think just in the circumstances. We observe this happening in a variety of situations. Claims by consumers against sellers that may be problematic on a warranty theory become “products liability” suits; claims against health care providers are commonly brought on “medical malpractice” rather than on contract theories; and suits against insurance companies that fail to provide the insured with the protection provided in the insurance contract become “bad faith” claims.</p>
<p class="indent">All complex legal systems divide problems into conventional analytic categories. Books are indexed, cases catalogued, and law school class hours subdivided in terms of conventional categories. You have one course in Contracts, another in Torts, and a third in Procedure. By the end of this year you will have a sense of the slot in which a particular problem belongs.</p>
<p class="indent">Civil justice requires persons who harm others by breaking legal obligations to compensate the injured party. This is both simple justice and necessary for social peace. Our legal system, like most others, distinguishes between injuries flowing from breach of an obligation specially assumed through a promise (contract) and those from breach of an obligation generally imposed by society without regard to any agreement (tort). These categories do not describe islands in the law; tort and contract often overlap. If the two overlap, why care whether liability is based in tort or contract? Indeed contracts and torts are separate legal categories in the common law largely on account of procedural considerations in earlier times that have little continuing relevance. Nevertheless, the distinction has stuck. Part of the reason is that the available remedies and the measure of damages are quite different in tort than they are in contract. Similarly, the process of proof at trial and the evidence that must be produced are likely to differ in the two classes of cases. An understanding of the relationship between tort and contract is illuminated by an appreciation of the past, and it helps to anticipate the future development of the law. Many of the most significant contract law problems seem to involve the gray area between tort and contract. Consumer warranties, socially regulated contracts, and form and mass contracts, to name just a few, are situations in which the law in the long run seems likely to move away from emphasis on the agreement aspects of the transaction to put greater weight on the general obligations of persons who enter those sorts of transactions.</p>

<p id="sec112" class="sectiona"><b>Hargrave v. Oki Nursery</b></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 1980.</p>
<p class="sectionb">636 F.2d 897.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ N<small>ICKERSON</small>, D<small>ISTRICT</small> J<small>UDGE</small>….</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff Long Island Vineyards, Inc., is a New York corporation of which plaintiff Hargrave is president. Plaintiffs operate a vineyard in Suffolk County, New York, and make wine from the grapes they produce. Oki is a California corporation with its main office in Sacramento and grows and sells nursery stocks including wine grape vines. The complaint, brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County, asserts six claims against Oki. The first alleges that during 1973 and 1974 Oki represented to plaintiffs that vines purchased from Oki would be healthy, free of disease, and suitable for wine production, that plaintiffs relied on the representations and in May 1974 purchased vines from Oki, that the representations were knowingly false, and that the vines sold to plaintiffs were diseased and incapable of bearing fruit of adequate quality or quantity for plaintiffs’ commercial wine production.</p>
<p class="indent">… Oki argues that no “tortious act” has been alleged in the complaint since plaintiffs, by applying the fraud label, may not convert a claim for breach of a contractual representation into a tort claim….</p>
<p class="indent">The law of torts and the law of contracts are said to protect different interests. A plaintiff may recover in contract because the defendant has made an agreement, and the law thinks it desirable that he be held to that agreement. Tort liability is imposed on the basis of some social policy that disapproves the infliction of a specific kind of harm irrespective of any agreement. Specifically the law of fraud seeks to protect against injury those who rely to their detriment on the deliberately dishonest statements of another.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, it does not follow that because acts constitute a breach of contract they cannot also give rise to liability in tort. Where the conduct alleged breaches a legal duty which exists “independent of contractual relations between the parties” a plaintiff may sue in tort…. If the only interest at stake is that of holding the defendant to a promise, the courts have said that the plaintiff may not transmogrify the contract claim into one for tort…. But if in addition there is an interest in protecting the plaintiff from other kinds of harm, the plaintiff may recover in tort whether or not he has a valid claim for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case the complaint sets forth all the elements of an action in tort for fraudulent representations, namely, “representation of a material existing fact, falsity, <span class="italic">scienter,</span> deception and injury.” Oki is alleged to have knowingly misrepresented the material existing fact that the vines were healthy. Plaintiffs assert they relied on the misrepresentations, paid for the vines, and sustained injury because <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page222" >222</span>they were in fact diseased. These allegations state a claim for fraud, and if Oki indeed made the fraudulent representations it “is subject to liability <span class="italic">in tort</span> whether the agreement is enforcible or not.”</p>
<p class="indent">The court need not consider plaintiffs’ other contentions.</p>
<p class="indent">The order is reversed.</p>
<p id="sec113" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. If the complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of New York (Suffolk County), how did the appeal end up in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit before a federal district judge?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. Does the distinction made by Judge Nickerson between the law of torts and the law of contracts explain why punitive damages are available for tort claims but not for contract claims? Does this case suggest that tort, like restitution, provides an alternative that is not necessarily exclusive of familiar contract recovery?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. In what sense is the harm which tort law redresses “irrespective of any agreement” if, as the opinion indicates, fraud focuses ultimately on the “statements of another”? To put the question differently, how can the legal duty that is a predicate to tort liability exist “independent of contractual relations between the parties” when the duty seems to arise out of the promissory relationship?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>4</b>. Did the Benkowskis have a legal duty “irrespective of any agreement” to provide uninterrupted water service to the Whites? S<span class="italic">ee</span> p. 91. Was there a legal duty grounded in tort that arose out of the promissory relationship?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>5</b>. The elements of proof will be different for fraud and for breach of contract. How will Hargrave show, for example, that Oki intended at the time the contract was made to sell inferior vines? Will such proof be needed to show contract breach? Will it be needed to show fraud? Suppose Oki learned of the vines’ deficiencies after the contract was formed but before it was performed. Finally, suppose all Hargrave can prove is that the vines as delivered were inferior.</p>

<p class="sectionb">931 P.2d 436.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ J<small>USTICE</small> K<small>IRSHBAUM</small> delivered the Opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indentn">In <span class="italic">Decker v. Browning–Ferris Industries of Colorado, Inc.</span>, and <span class="italic">Castillo v. Browning–Ferris Industries of Colorado, Inc.</span>, the court of appeals determined, inter alia, that <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page223" >223</span>plaintiffs-petitioners Thomas H. Decker (Decker) and Jose Castillo (Castillo) could not recover damages in tort from their employer, defendant-respondent Browning-Ferris Industries of Colorado, Inc. (BFI), for breach of an express covenant of good faith and fair dealing because no such tort exists in Colorado in the employment context. The court of appeals also remanded both cases to the trial court for new trials on damages because it could not determine from the special verdict forms and instructions on damages whether the juries had based their awards on the tort claims. Having granted certiorari to review the propriety of the court of appeals’ decisions, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the cases to the court of appeals with directions.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>I</b></p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>A</b></p>
<p class="indent">In June 1985, Decker obtained a position as a trash removal truck driver’s helper with BFI. Decker was hired by Anthony Vagneur (Vagneur), the manager of BFI’s Aspen, Colorado, district (the Aspen District), and was assigned to work in that district. In 1985, Decker earned a wage of $7.75 per hour.</p>
<p class="indent">Decker was subsequently promoted to the position of trash removal truck driver, which position Decker held for approximately five years. Decker received each pay increase for which he was eligible during his employment with BFI. In 1990, Vagneur wrote a letter to Decker informing Decker that he would receive a “discretionary” $400 bonus, congratulating Decker “on having a successful winter season with BFI,” and stating that BFI appreciated Decker’s work. The letter contained a statement that BFI “look[ed] forward to a long and lasting relationship” with Decker.</p>
<p class="indent">Vagneur was Decker’s immediate supervisor until January 1991, when BFI discharged Vagneur and replaced him with Gerald P. Vandervelde (Vandervelde). In August 1991, Vandervelde terminated Decker’s employment for the stated reason that Decker worked too slowly. At this time Decker earned a wage of $11.50 per hour. After his discharge from BFI, Decker obtained employment for a period of time as a truck driver for a newspaper company, earning $95 per day without benefits. Decker subsequently opened a restaurant using retirement funds accumulated during his employment at BFI as well as money borrowed from family members. At the time of trial, the restaurant was not profitable.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>B</b></p>
<p class="indent">Castillo was hired by Vagneur in 1989 as a trash removal truck driver’s helper for BFI in BFI’s Aspen district. During the course of his employment, Castillo was promoted to the position of driver and received approximately five pay raises. In 1990 Castillo received a letter from Vagneur congratulating Castillo on a “successful winter season with BFI,” expressing BFI’s appreciation for Castillo’s work, <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page224" >224</span>informing Castillo of his entitlement to a “discretionary” $400 bonus, and containing a statement that BFI looked forward to a “long and lasting relationship” with Castillo. In May 1991, Castillo broke his ankle while performing duties at BFI and reported the injury to BFI’s workers’ compensation physician. Castillo ultimately received workers’ compensation benefits for this injury. In June 1991, Castillo obtained permission from his physician to return to BFI with the restriction that he perform only light duties. In August 1991 Vandervelde terminated Castillo’s employment on the stated ground that Castillo was working too slowly. After his employment at BFI was terminated, Castillo twice underwent surgery on his ankle. In December 1992, he worked for ten days as a dishwasher at a restaurant. He obtained a full-time position with another company in March 1993, earning a wage of $8.00 per hour with no benefits. At the time of trial, Castillo was still employed by that company.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>C</b></p>
<p class="indent">In early 1992, Decker and Castillo filed separate civil actions in the trial court against BFI. Because both Decker and Castillo were represented by the same counsel and had been discharged under similar circumstances from their employment with BFI, their complaints were identical in many respects. Decker and Castillo alleged, inter alia, that they had been discharged in violation of a progressive disciplinary policy adopted by Vagneur—a claim for wrongful discharge which sounded in contract. Decker and Castillo subsequently filed amended complaints against BFI which contained an additional claim of “breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing” based on alleged express promises by BFI management that they would be treated fairly. Although the amended complaints characterized this as a contract claim, the amended complaints requested compensatory, noneconomic and punitive damages with respect to this claim.</p>
<p class="indent">Castillo’s action was tried first. At trial, Vagneur testified that he had personally promised to treat Castillo fairly. During the instruction conference, BFI objected to the instructions and special verdict forms which would permit the jury to award punitive damages on the breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim. BFI argued that this claim sounded in contract, and punitive damages are not available for a breach of contract. The trial court held that while the covenant of good faith and fair dealing may have had its origins in contract law, its breach constituted a tort and could thus properly support an award of punitive damages. Aside from this one objection to the submission of punitive damages, BFI raised no other objection concerning the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, either as to the instruction defining its elements or to the special verdict form which permitted the jury to award damages for “inconvenience and emotional stress” in the event of its breach. At closing arguments, neither party made any distinction between contract and tort theories concerning the claim for breach of express covenant of good faith and fair <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page225" >225</span>dealing, but merely discussed whether BFI had breached its promises of fair treatment to Castillo. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Castillo and against BFI. The jury determined that BFI had adopted a personnel policy concerning discipline and termination and had breached that policy. The jury also determined that BFI had promised fair treatment to Castillo in its employment decisions and had breached that promise as well. The jury awarded Castillo $33,500 in damages for lost income, determined that BFI’s breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing was attended by circumstances of willful and wanton conduct by BFI, and awarded Castillo punitive damages in the amount of $11,500. The jury did not award Castillo damages for inconvenience or emotional stress. BFI did not file any post-trial motions. With respect to Decker’s claims, BFI expressly stipulated at trial that it had promised to treat Decker fairly. BFI also raised the same objections concerning punitive damages that it had raised in Castillo’s case, and the trial court likewise denied them for the same reasons. The parties similarly never raised the contract/tort distinction before the jury, but merely discussed whether BFI had breached its promises of fair treatment to Decker. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Decker and against BFI on the breach of disciplinary policy and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims. As in Castillo’s case, the jury found that BFI had terminated Decker in violation of both its progressive disciplinary policy and its express promise of fair treatment. The jury also found that BFI had willfully and wantonly breached its promises of good faith and fair dealing. The jury awarded Decker $600,000 in damages for lost income, $80,000 in damages for inconvenience and emotional stress, and an additional $680,000 in punitive damages on the claim of breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. BFI filed post-trial motions which focused largely on the matter of the punitive damage award. BFI adopted the trial court’s characterization of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim as a tort, and stipulated that the claim had been tried as a tort. BFI argued that Colorado did not recognize a tort claim for breach of an express covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the employment context.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>D</b></p>
<p class="indent">BFI appealed both cases. Throughout the appellate proceedings before this court and the court of appeals, the parties have referred to the breach of disciplinary policy claim as the “contract” claim, and the breach of express covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim as the “tort” claim. The primary issue presented which the parties framed for the court of appeals was whether Colorado recognized a tort claim for breach of an express covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the employment context. In Decker’s case, the court of appeals accepted the parties’ characterizations of the breach of disciplinary policy claim as a contract claim and the breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim as a tort claim. The court of appeals affirmed the jury’s determination of liability on the breach of contract <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page226" >226</span>claim, but determined that because Colorado does not recognize a tort claim in the employment context for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the trial court erroneously allowed the jury to consider that claim. The court of appeals concluded that in the absence of a viable tort claim, the awards for punitive damages and noneconomic damages must be vacated. The court of appeals held that the punitive damage award could not be based upon the breach of the progressive disciplinary policy claim because it was a contract claim. With respect to the award of noneconomic damages, the court observed that while damages for “mental suffering” are sometimes recoverable for willful and wanton breach of contract, the jury in this case was not requested to find willful and wanton breach of the progressive disciplinary policy. The court of appeals also determined that the award of noneconomic damages was improper because noneconomic damages may be awarded in a breach of contract action only for “mental suffering,” and the jury instructions allowed the jury to consider future noneconomic losses as well as inconvenience and emotional stress. The court of appeals noted that Decker could on retrial seek damages for mental suffering for breach of contract if he proved that BFI’s breach of the progressive disciplinary policy was willful or wanton. In setting aside the award of $600,000 for lost income, the court of appeals concluded that it was impossible to discern from the special verdict form under which theory the lost income was awarded, and that it must be presumed that BFI had been prejudiced by the special verdict form.</p>
<p class="indent">The court of appeals employed an identical analysis in Castillo’s appeal. It held that Colorado does not recognize a tort claim for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the context of employment relations, and set aside the jury’s award of punitive damages based on that claim. It also affirmed the jury’s verdict on liability for breach of the progressive disciplinary policy, but held that the award of economic damages had to be vacated because it was impossible to determine whether it had been awarded under the proper contract theory or the improper tort theory. The court of appeals thus remanded both cases for new trials on damages.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>II</b></p>
<p class="indent">Decker and Castillo argue that tort claims for breach of express covenant of good faith and fair dealing are cognizable in Colorado in the employment context. We reject this argument.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>* * *</b></p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>2</b></p>
<p class="indent">We have recognized in the context of insurance contracts that a party to such an agreement may recover damages in tort for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. An insurer’s tort liability for breach of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing arises from the nature of the insurance contract as well as from <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page227" >227</span>the relationship between the insurer and the insured. In contrast to a party who seeks to secure commercial advantage in the context of a general commercial contract, an insured who enters into a contract of insurance seeks to obtain “financial security and protection against calamity.” Because an insurer’s bad faith refusal to pay valid claims defeats the very purpose of the insurance contract, a special duty is imposed upon an insurer to deal in good faith with an insured. This “quasi-fiduciary” relationship between an insurer and an insured is thus based in part on this special contract. In addition, when an insured suffers a loss, the insured becomes “particularly vulnerable” to the insurer. For example, an insurer may delay payment of a claim to the insured in the hope of settling for an amount less than what might be due under the contract. Thus the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the context of insurance contracts also arises from the heightened reliance necessarily placed by an insured on the insurer.</p>
<p class="indent">Decker and Castillo suggest that an employment relationship possesses many of the characteristics found in the relationship between an insurer and an insured in support of their argument that a covenant of good faith and fair dealing should be imposed in the former context. The insurance analogy has been rejected by several courts.</p>
<p class="indent">There are certain parallels between insurance and employment contexts. An insurance contract protects the insured from such calamities as medical emergencies and accidental property damage. An employment contract is of even greater significance to an employee because it provides the means for the employee to meet his or her basic needs. Thus both insurance and employment contracts afford financial security to the insured and the employee, respectively. However, the positions of insureds and of employees who suffer harm as a result of unreasonable conduct are not always similar. A wrongfully discharged employee may be able to obtain alternative employment and must make reasonable attempts to do so to mitigate damages. Unreasonably discharged employees who are not able to secure alternative employment may recover damages for lost income.<sup><b><a id="fn_34" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></b></sup> In contrast, an insured whose valid claim for coverage has been denied in bad faith has no recourse in the marketplace. No other insurance company will assume responsibility for the insured’s losses. It is also noteworthy that the interests of insureds and insurers may conflict. An insurer has an incentive to delay payment of a valid claim in the hope of settling for an amount less than the sum owed pursuant to the policy. In contrast, employees as well as employers generally seek to promote the business interests of the employer. Of course, the possibility of arbitrary and unreasonable treatment by an employer <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page228" >228</span>always exists—a phenomenon which can not be prevented by reliance on the dynamics of the marketplace.</p>
<p class="indent">Some courts have applied rationales developed in insurance contract cases to recognize a tort claim for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment cases. In <span class="italic">K Mart Corp. v. Ponsock</span>, 103 Nev. 39 (1987), the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a forklift driver. The defendant consistently characterized the plaintiff as an excellent employee. The plaintiff’s retirement benefits were due to vest after the plaintiff had been employed for ten years. A few months before the plaintiff’s retirement benefits were due to vest, the plaintiff was terminated by the defendant, allegedly for applying paint to the battery cover of the forklift which he operated. The plaintiff, without securing permission from his supervisor, had applied paint from a can he discovered earlier in the day to the battery cover in order to remedy the deteriorating condition of that cover. When asked by a maintenance worker to remove the paint, the plaintiff complied. The plaintiff was reprimanded by a supervisor for his conduct, and his “separation report” provided that he had been terminated for defacing company property with misappropriated merchandise (the paint) on company time. A jury determined that the defendant had in reality terminated the plaintiff in order to avoid paying the plaintiff’s retirement benefits. The court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to tort damages reasoning that the employee was highly economically dependent upon the employer and vulnerable to the employer’s abuse because of that dependency. The court determined that the particular employment relationship at issue was similar to the relationship between an insured and an insurer because the plaintiff specially relied on the defendant’s apparent commitment to retain the plaintiff until retirement.</p>
<p class="indent">The court limited its holding to the particular factual circumstances of the case as follows: “The special relationships of trust between this employer and this employee under this contract under this type of abusive and arbitrary dismissal cries out for relief and for a remedy beyond that traditionally flowing from breach of contract.” In <span class="italic">D’Angelo v. Gardner</span>, 107 Nev. 704 (1991), the Supreme Court of Nevada distinguished <span class="italic">Ponsock</span> in holding that a plaintiff employee was not entitled to an award of tort damages, comparing the facts of that case to the facts of <span class="italic">Ponsock</span> and describing <span class="italic">Ponsock</span> as “the exemplar for that narrow class of cases in which, because of the relationship of employer to employee, the offending conduct ‘goes well beyond the bounds of ordinary liability for breach of contract.’”</p>
<p class="indent">In view of these cases, it is not clear that the rationales supporting recognition of the tort of breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the context of insurance contracts require recognition of a tort claim for bad faith breach of an express covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the employment context.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page229" >229</div>
<p class="center_hd"><b>3</b></p>
<p class="indent">However, we conclude that a tort claim for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing need not be recognized in the employment context because we have previously recognized the existence a tort claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. That claim, as well as tort claims for bad faith breach of insurance contracts, are firmly grounded in legislative or other public policy declarations thus insuring that all interested parties are aware of the scope of the relevant duty….</p>
<p class="indent">It is thus apparent that the torts of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy and bad faith breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in insurance contracts are based on administrative or legislative declarations of public policy. As a result, employers and insurers have notice of the scope of their duties to their employees and insureds. No parallel declarations of public policy have been articulated by the General Assembly or other governmental institutions with respect to the employment context. In the absence of such declarations of public policy, there is no appropriate basis upon which to ground a tort of breach of an express covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment contracts. To the extent the contents of employment contracts and insurance contracts are similar, the tort of wrongful termination of an employment contract in violation of public policy represents an appropriate analog to the tort of bad faith breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing of an insurance contract.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>III</b></p>
<p class="indent">For the foregoing reasons, we decline to recognize the existence in this jurisdiction of a tort claim for breach of an express covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment contracts. However, we have concluded that the claims for breach of express covenant of good faith and fair dealing asserted by Decker and Castillo sound in contract, not in tort. We therefore address issues respecting the damage awards in these cases.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>A</b></p>
<p class="indent">Decker and Castillo assert that the court of appeals erred in reversing the judgments of punitive damages entered by the trial court. We reject this argument.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Mortgage Finance, Inc. v. Podleski</span> (Colo.1987), we emphasized that the law of torts and the law of contracts reflect different policies and, therefore, recognize different remedies. The law of contracts does not seek to compel performance of a contract by punishing a breach, but rather to compensate the promisee for losses sustained as a result of a breach. The law of torts is premised upon legal duties imposed by law. Breach of such legal duties can, in certain circumstances, justify the imposition of exemplary damages in order to punish the defendant and deter others from similar conduct in the future.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page230" >230</div>
<p class="indent">Here, as in <span class="italic">Podleski</span>, we are faced with conduct which amounts to a breach of contract, and “no tort claim was before the trial court at the conclusion of the trial.” Under such circumstances, the awards of punitive damages must be vacated, as the court of appeals determined.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>B</b></p>
<p class="indent">Decker and Castillo argue that the court of appeals erroneously reversed the juries’ verdicts awarding them economic damages. We agree.</p>
<p class="indent">… [A]lthough the special verdict forms require the juries to reach separate liability determinations with respect to the breach of progressive disciplinary policy and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims, such forms do not require the juries to distinguish between the two claims when determining whether damages for lost income, inconvenience and emotional stress should be awarded. In each case, the special verdict form provides that if the jury finds BFI liable on either claim, the jury should “state the amount of lost income, if any, suffered * * * .” In addition, the special verdict forms allowed the juries to award damages for “inconvenience and emotional stress” if they answered “yes” to liability on either the breach of disciplinary policy or breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.</p>
<p class="indent">The court of appeals concluded that it was “impossible” to discern whether the awards for economic damages were based on the proper breach of disciplinary policy claim or the improper breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim. However, as we have observed, in each case both the claim for breach of the progressive disciplinary policy and the claim for breach of express covenant of good faith and fair dealing were pled, tried, and found by the jury to be breaches of an express contractual obligation. The juries’ calculations of economic damages in these cases were limited by the instructions to “back pay, loss of future pay and loss of benefits,” which are appropriate economic damages designed to put the wrongfully discharged employee in the same position he or she would have been in had the employer not breach the employment contract. Under the circumstances of these cases, we conclude that the juries’ awards of economic damages to Decker and to Castillo should be affirmed.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>C</b></p>
<p class="indent">Decker argues that in the event that we should refuse to recognize a tort claim for breach of express covenant of good faith and fair dealing, we should treat the jury’s findings on that claim as a finding that BFI’s breach of contract was attended by willful and wanton conduct and thereby uphold the jury’s award of $80,000 in noneconomic damages. We agree.</p>
<p class="indent">The special verdict form submitted to the jury authorized an award of punitive damages if the jury found “with respect to Thomas Decker’s claim for breach of the <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page231" >231</span>covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that the injury, if any, was attended by circumstances of willful and wanton conduct by BFI.” The jury found that BFI’s conduct in firing Decker was willful and wanton.</p>
<p class="indent">Although we have concluded that the juries’ awards of punitive damages must be vacated, the jury’s special verdict with respect to Decker’s claims establishes that the jury found that BFI breached an express contractual obligation to Decker and that such breach was characterized by willful and wanton conduct. Damages for “mental suffering” are recoverable on a breach of contract claim when the breach is accompanied by willful and wanton conduct and when the damages are a natural and proximate consequence of such conduct. Here, the jury awarded noneconomic damages specifically for “inconvenience and emotional stress” caused in part by BFI’s breach of its promise of fair treatment. Thus, the award of $80,000 in noneconomic damages for BFI’s willful and wanton breach of its express covenant of good faith and fair dealing is proper under Colorado law, and must be upheld.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>D</b></p>
<p class="indent">Because the court of appeals reversed all of the damage awards against BFI, it did not address BFI’s claim that the jury’s award of $600,000 to Decker in lost wages was excessive. As noted in part I(A), at the time of his discharge Decker earned a wage of $11.50 per hour. Considering the testimony of Decker’s economic expert in the light most favorable to Decker as the verdict winner, it is clear that the jury’s award of $600,000 in economic damages includes a substantial amount for front pay, or lost future wages.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, while we affirm the jury’s finding that BFI is liable to Decker for economic damages, we remand Decker’s case to the court of appeals for consideration of BFI’s arguments challenging the amount of the jury’s award of economic damages in that case.</p>
<p id="sec115" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. In most jurisdictions, covenants of good faith and fair dealing are implied in all contracts, and, in general, this obligation cannot be waived or disclaimed. In this sense the “covenant” is an obligation imposed by law rather than one voluntarily assumed, and on this basis injured parties have argued that bad faith conduct in the course of contractual performance may give rise to tort remedies. In most contexts and most jurisdictions these attempts have been rebuffed. Ordinarily, bad faith breach of contract will give rise only to ordinary contract remedies. Do you agree with this position? Why not punish bad faith behavior in connection with contractual performance?</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page232" >232</div>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. Recall Justice O’Souter’s opinion in <span class="italic">Best v. Southland,</span> p. 20. O’Souter argues that courts should generally view failure to perform as promised as giving rise to tort remedies and notes that they indeed do so in certain contexts. His argument draws heavily on G<small>RANT</small> G<small>ILMORE</small>, T<small>HE</small> D<small>EATH OF</small> C<small>ONTRACT</small> (1974) a scholarly <span class="italic">tour d’force</span> which traced the history of contract law back to its roots in trespass and projected that contract and tort might be in incipiently recombining. And indeed in the 1970s and 1980s, California appeared to be leading the way towards generally assimilating contract and tort remedies by creating a tort action for negligent interference with prospective economic advantage (a tort that sounds very much like negligent breach of contract) in a widely-commented upon case, <span class="italic">J’Aire Corp. v. Gregory</span>, 24 Cal. 3d 799 (1979). <span class="italic">J’Aire</span> awarded the plaintiff, a commercial tenant, compensation for lost profits based on unreasonable construction delays on the landlord’s property. <span class="italic">See also People Express Airlines v. Consolidated Rail Corp.</span>, 100 N.J. 246 (1985) (imposing tort liability on railroad for economic losses arising out of plaintiff airline’s flight cancellations necessitated by gas leak from railway tank car). Moreover, the California Supreme Court of this era also had started down the road of generally authorizing punitive damages as a remedy for bad-faith breach of a commercial contract in another much-commented upon case, <span class="italic">Seaman’s Direct Buying Service v. Standard Oil Co. of California.</span>, 36 Cal. 3d 752 (1984).</p>
<p class="indent">But the predicted demise of contract law proved at best premature. These developments in the California case law were criticized, cut short, and sharply limited in the 1990s. In <span class="italic">Freeman &amp; Mills v. Belcher Oil Co.</span>, 11 Cal. 4th 85 (1995), the California Supreme Court overruled <span class="italic">Seaman’s</span>. The California Supreme Court also appears to have sharply limited <span class="italic">J’Aire</span>, in <span class="italic">Aas v. Superior Court of San Diego County (William Lyon Co., Real Party-In-Interest)</span>, 24 Cal. 4th 627 (2000). In <span class="italic">Aas</span>, the Court rejected a claim for recovery of economic losses in a negligence action in a home construction case in the absence of personal injury or physical property damage asserting:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Any construction defect can diminish the value of a house. But the difference between price paid and value received, and deviations from standards of quality that have not resulted in property damage or personal injury, are primarily the domain of contract and warranty law or the law of fraud, rather than of negligence. In actions for negligence, a manufacturer’s liability is limited to damages for physical injuries; no recovery is allowed for economic loss alone. This general principle, the so-called economic loss rule, is the primary obstacle to plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Id</span>. at 636. The bottom line appears to be that “prospective economic advantage” remains compensable in California only under the more restrictive traditional contract doctrines, and this includes the rule that punitive damages are not available in contract except in cases where an independent tort cause of action exists (generally <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page233" >233</span>based on property damage or personal injury or fraud) or where a unique special relationship exists, such as that between insurer and insured.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. Perhaps the most salient difference between contract and tort is the nature of the injuries usually sought to be redressed. Contract focuses on protecting economic expectancies. Tort focuses on compensating personal injuries. Does this difference support the remedial distinctions between tort and contract? Do these distinctions make sense when the nature of the injury is the loss of a job? Why does the <span class="italic">Decker</span> court award the plaintiff $80,000 in non-economic damages after rejecting his tort theory?</p>

<p id="sec116" class="sectiona"><b>Jarvis v. Swans Tours Ltd.</b></p>
<p class="sectionb">Court of Appeal, Civil Division, 1973.</p>
<p class="sectionb">[1973] 1 Q.B. 233.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ L<small>ORD</small> D<small>ENNING</small>. The plaintiff, Mr. Jarvis, is a solicitor employed by a local authority at Barking. In 1969 he was minded to go for Christmas to Switzerland. He was looking forward to a ski-ing holiday. It is his one fortnight’s holiday in the year. He prefers it in the winter rather than in the summer.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Jarvis read a brochure issued by Swans Tours, Ltd. He was much attracted by the description of Mörlialp, Giswil, Central Switzerland. I will not read the whole of it, but just pick out some of the principal attractions:</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">H<small>OUSE</small> P<small>ARTY</small> C<small>ENTRE</small> with special resident host * * * M<small>ÖRLIALP</small> is a most wonderful little resort on a sunny plateau * * * Up there you will find yourself in the midst of beautiful alpine scenery, which in winter becomes a wonderland of sun, snow and ice, with a wide variety of fine ski-runs, a skating-rink and an exhilarating toboggan run * * * Why did we choose the Hotel Krone … mainly and most of all, because of the G<small>EMUTLICHKEIT</small> and friendly welcome you will receive from Herr and Frau Weibel * * * The Hotel Krone has its own Alphütte Bar which will be open several evenings a week * * * No doubt you will be in for a great time, when you book this houseparty holiday * * * Mr. Weibel, the charming owner, speaks English.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the same page, in a special yellow box, it was said:</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">S<small>WANS</small> H<small>OUSEPARTY IN</small> M<small>ÖRLIALP</small>. <span class="italic">All these Houseparty arrangements are included in the price of your holiday.</span> Welcome party on arrival. Afternoon tea and cake for 7 days. Swiss Dinner by candlelight. Fondue-party. Yodler evening. Chali farewell party in the “Alphütte Bar.” Service of representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">Alongside on the same page there was a special note about ski-packs:</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt">“Hire of Skis, Sticks and Boots * * * 12 days £11·10.”</p>
<p class="indent">In August 1969, on the faith of that brochure, Mr. Jarvis booked a 15 day holiday, with ski-pack. The total charge was £63·45, including Christmas supplement. He <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page234" >234</span>was to fly from Gatwick to Zurich on 20th December 1969 and return on 3rd January 1970.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiff went on the holiday, but he was very disappointed. He was a man of about 35 and he expected to be one of a houseparty of some 30 or so people. Instead, he found there were only 13 during the first week. In the second week there was no houseparty at all. He was the only person there. Mr. Weibel could not speak English. So there was Mr. Jarvis, in the second week, in his hotel with no houseparty at all, and no one could speak English, except himself. He was very disappointed, too, with the ski-ing. It was some distance away at Giswil. There were no ordinary length skis. There were only miniskis, about 3 ft. long. So he did not get his ski-ing as he wanted to. In the second week he did get some longer skis for a couple of days, but then, because of the boots, his feet got rubbed and he could not continue even with the long skis. So his ski-ing holiday, from his point of view, was pretty well ruined.</p>
<p class="indent">There were many other matters, too. They appear trivial when they are set down in writing, but I have no doubt they loomed large in Mr. Jarvis’s mind, when coupled with the other disappointments. He did not have the nice Swiss cakes which he was hoping for. The only cakes for tea were potato crisps and little dry nutcakes. The yodler evening consisted of one man from the locality who came in his working clothes for a little while, and sang four or five songs very quickly. The “Alphütte Bar” was an unoccupied annexe which was only open one evening. There was a representative, Mrs. Storr, there during the first week, but she was not there during the second week. The matter was summed up by the learned judge:</p>
<p class="blockquote">* * * during the first week he got a holiday in Switzerland which was to some extent inferior * * * and, as to the second week he got a holiday which was very largely inferior [to what he was led to expect].</p>
<p class="indent">What is the legal position? I think that the statements in the brochure were representations or warranties. The breaches of them give Mr. Jarvis a right to damages. It is not necessary to decide whether they were representations or warranties; because, since the Misrepresentation Act of 1967, there is a remedy in damages for misrepresentation as well as for breach of warranty.</p>
<p class="indent">The one question in the case is: what is the amount of damages? The judge seems to have taken the difference in value between what he paid for and what he got. He said that he intended to give “the difference between the two values and no other damages” under any other head. He thought that Mr. Jarvis had got half of what he paid for. So the judge gave him half the amount which he had paid, namely, £31·72. Mr. Jarvis appeals to this court. He says that the damages ought to have been much more.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page235" >235</div>
<p class="indent">What is the right way of assessing damages? It has often been said that on a breach of contract damages cannot be given for mental distress. Thus in <span class="italic">Hamlin v. Great Northern Railway Co.</span>, Pollock, C.B., said that damages cannot be given “for the disappointment of mind occasioned by the breach of contract.” And in <span class="italic">Hobbs v. London &amp; South Western Railway Co.</span>, Mellor, J., said that–</p>
<p class="blockquote">* * * for the mere inconvenience, such as annoyance and loss of temper, or vexation, or for being disappointed in a particular thing which you have set your mind upon, without real physical inconvenience resulting, you cannot recover damages.</p>
<p class="indent">The courts in those days only allowed the plaintiff to recover damages if he suffered physical inconvenience, such as, having to walk five miles home, as in Hobbs’s case; or to live in an overcrowded house: see <span class="italic">Bailey v. Bullock</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">I think that those limitations are out of date. In a proper case damages for mental distress can be recovered in contract, just as damages for shock can be recovered in tort. One such case is a contract for a holiday, or any other contract to provide entertainment and enjoyment. If the contracting party breaks his contract, damages can be given for the disappointment, the distress, the upset and frustration caused by the breach. I know that it is difficult to assess in terms of money, but it is no more difficult than the assessment which the courts have to make every day in personal injury cases for loss of amenities. Take the present case. Mr. Jarvis has only a fortnight’s holiday in the year. He books it far ahead, and looks forward to it all that time. He ought to be compensated for the loss of it.</p>
<p class="indent">A good illustration was given by Edmund Davies L.J. in the course of the argument. He put the case of a man who has taken a ticket for Glyndbourne. It is the only night on which he can get there. He hires a car to take him. The car does not turn up. His damages are not limited to the mere cost of the ticket. He is entitled to general damages for the disappointment he has suffered and the loss of the entertainment which he should have had. Here, Mr. Jarvis’s fortnight’s winter holiday has been a grave disappointment. It is true that he was conveyed to Switzerland and back and had meals and bed in the hotel. But that is not what he went for. He went to enjoy himself with all the facilities which the defendants said he would have. He is entitled to damages for the lack of those facilities, and for his loss of enjoyment.</p>
<p class="indent">A similar case occurred in 1951. It was <span class="italic">Stedman v. Swan’s Tours</span>. A holiday-maker was awarded damages because he did not get the bedroom and the accommodation which he was promised. The county court judge awarded him £13·15s. This court increased it to £50.</p>
<p class="indent">I think the judge was in error in taking the sum paid for the holiday, £63·45, and halving it. The right measure of damages is to compensate him for the loss of entertainment and enjoyment which he was promised, and which he did not get. Looking <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page236" >236</span>at the matter quite broadly, I think the damages in this case should be the sum of £125. I would allow the appeal accordingly.</p>

<p id="sec117" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. It appears that Mr. Jarvis stayed at Mörlialp for the two weeks of his tour. Should he be able to recover for all his disappointments, or should his recovery be offset by the damages he could have avoided by telephoning for a taxi on the second day and moving to a better hotel?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. This was Mr. Jarvis’ only vacation for the year. Would the result have been the same if Jarvis’ employer gave him six weeks vacation per year? Does Swans Tours have to ask all potential tour participants how important their vacation is to them?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. Jarvis paid £63.45 for his holiday and was allowed £125 for his disappointment. In what sense is this the financial equivalent of performance? Is a £63 vacation that lives up to expectations worth £125? If Jarvis’ one fortnight of vacation per year is so valuable to him, why did he book such a cheap tour? Didn’t he assume the risk?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>4</b>. The <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span> reported on February 9, 1989 that thousands of German tourists sue tour operators each year for “defective travel” or “loss of pleasure on holiday” when their holiday is damaged by dirt, insects, seasickness, or inadequate hotel rooms. German judges use a schedule of fixed damages in such cases that provides, for instance, that if the brochure promises a heated swimming pool and the pool is cold the client may claim 5% of the tour price, a room without a bathroom is likely to be awarded 15% to 20% and food that tastes terrible 20% to 30%. Lack of promised facilities for nude sunbathing can be worth up to 20%.</p>
<p class="indent">On April 25, 1991, the Local Court (Amtsgericht) of Mönchengladbach, Germany, issued the following judgment (Az.: 5 ä C 106/91):</p>
<p class="left_hd"><b>Statement of Facts</b></p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Plaintiff booked a vacation on Menorca, Hotel La Calata, with the defendant tour operator for himself and his life companion (<span class="italic">Lebensgefährtin</span>) from August 15 to 29, 1990 for the price of DM 3,078.00. The accommodation was to be a double room with a double bed. Plaintiff alleges that after arrival at the hotel he discovered that instead of a double bed, the room contained two unattached twin beds. Plaintiff claims that his sleeping and cohabitation habits were severely impaired from the first night. He was unable to enjoy the peaceful and harmonious experience of falling asleep and cohabitating with his companion during the <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page237" >237</span>whole two-week vacation period, because the twin beds, which were standing on slippery tiles, separated at the slightest motion. Harmonious cohabitation was completely impossible.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Plaintiff demands recovery of damages for vacation time that was wasted, in the amount of 20% of the vacation expenses. The anticipated recreational value, the relaxation, and the hoped for harmony with his life companion was substantially impaired. This led to peevishness, dissatisfaction, and annoyance displayed by him and by his life companion. Thus the recreational value of their vacation suffered.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Plaintiff moves that defendant be ordered to pay him DM 615.50, plus interest from September 11, 1990.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Defendant asks for the dismissal of the action….</p>
<p class="left_hd"><b>Reasons for the decision</b></p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">In any case, upon the merits, this claim is without sufficient basis.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Plaintiff does not explain in detail why his specific cohabitation habits require a double bed fixed to each other. This point needs not be further developed, though, because the particular habits of the plaintiff are not important. What is important is whether the beds were unsuitable for the average traveler. But the beds were appropriate. The Court is aware of several generally known and usual variations for performing sexual intercourse, which can indeed be practiced on a single bed to the satisfaction of all participants. Thus, Plaintiff did not have to spend his vacation completely without the private life he so desired.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Even if one concedes that Plaintiff’s special cohabitation practices require a double bed, there is no breach in the performance of the vacation contract, because the fault could have been removed immediately. That is to say, when a fault can be remedied easily, the traveler is expected to do so on his own, so that the full vacation benefits can be realized and no claim for damages exists.</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">Plaintiff presented the court a photograph of the beds in question. In this photo one can see that the mattresses lie on a solid frame which obviously is made of metal. The two metal frames quickly could have been joined with a strong cord. It may be that the plaintiff did not have such a cord with him, but it could have been purchased inexpensively. Until a suitable cord was acquired, Plaintiff could have availed himself of his trouser belt for instance, because this was certainly not needed in its original function at that moment …</p>
<p class="noindent">Aha!</p>

<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">Remedies are as much a product of the agreement as other performance terms. Freedom of contract would suggest that the parties have the power to eliminate future confusion or difficulties over the damages to be awarded in the event of a breach by providing in the contract either an amount or a formula for calculating them. Nevertheless, for centuries the courts affixed the label of “penalty” to such contract provisions and often refused to enforce them. More recently the law has increasingly recognized the propriety of parties contracting their way out of remedies problems. If the contract provision is considered reasonable it will be described as “liquidated damages” and will be honored by a court. The consequences of attaching the labels are clear: reasonable liquidated damages will be enforced, and penalties will be disregarded. How does a lawyer determine which is which when drafting a contract? She does the best she can with the clues available, always uncomfortably aware of the fact that hindsight causes many a judge to view as a penalty that which the parties saw as a reasonable damage estimate at the time they made their contract.</p>

<p id="sec119" class="sectiona"><b>Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co.</b></p>
<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, 1985.</p>
<p class="sectionb">769 F.2d 1284.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>OSNER</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indentn">This diversity suit between Lake River Corporation and Carborundum Company requires us to consider questions of Illinois commercial law, and in particular to explore the fuzzy line between penalty clauses and liquidated-damages clauses.</p>
<p class="indent">Carborundum manufactures “Ferro Carbo,” an abrasive powder used in making steel. To serve its midwestern customers better, Carborundum made a contract with Lake River by which the latter agreed to provide distribution services in its warehouse in Illinois. Lake River would receive Ferro Carbo in bulk from Carborundum, “bag” it, and ship the bagged product to Carborundum’s customers. The Ferro Carbo would remain Carborundum’s property until delivered to the customers.</p>
<p class="indent">Carborundum insisted that Lake River install a new bagging system to handle the contract. In order to be sure of being able to recover the cost of the new system ($89,000) and make a profit of 20 percent of the contract price, Lake River insisted on the following minimum-quantity guarantee:</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt1">In consideration of the special equipment [i.e., the new bagging system] to be acquired and furnished by LAKE–RIVER for handling the product, CARBORUNDUM <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page239" >239</span>shall, during the initial three-year term of this Agreement, ship to LAKE–RIVER for bagging a minimum quantity of [22,500 tons]. If, at the end of the three-year term, this minimum quantity shall not have been shipped, LAKE–RIVER shall invoice CARBORUNDUM at the then prevailing rates for the difference between the quantity bagged and the minimum guaranteed.</p>
<p class="indent">If Carborundum had shipped the full minimum quantity that it guaranteed, it would have owed Lake River roughly $533,000 under the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">After the contract was signed in 1979, the demand for domestic steel, and with it the demand for Ferro Carbo, plummeted, and Carborundum failed to ship the guaranteed amount. When the contract expired late in 1982, Carborundum had shipped only 12,000 of the 22,500 tons it had guaranteed. Lake River had bagged the 12,000 tons and had billed Carborundum for this bagging, and Carborundum had paid, but by virtue of the formula in the minimum-guarantee clause Carborundum still owed Lake River $241,000—the contract price of $533,000 if the full amount of Ferro Carbo had been shipped, minus what Carborundum had paid for the bagging of the quantity it had shipped.</p>
<p class="indent">When Lake River demanded payment of this amount, Carborundum refused, on the ground that the formula imposed a penalty. At the time, Lake River had in its warehouse 500 tons of bagged Ferro Carbo, having a market value of $269,000, which it refused to release unless Carborundum paid the $241,000 due under the formula. Lake River did offer to sell the bagged product and place the proceeds in escrow until its dispute with Carborundum over the enforceability of the formula was resolved, but Carborundum rejected the offer and trucked in bagged Ferro Carbo from the East to serve its customers in Illinois, at an additional cost of $31,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Lake River brought this suit for $241,000, which it claims as liquidated damages. Carborundum counterclaimed for the value of the bagged Ferro Carbo when Lake River impounded it and the additional cost of serving the customers affected by the impounding. The theory of the counterclaim is that the impounding was a conversion, and not as Lake River contends the assertion of a lien. The district judge, after a bench trial, gave judgment for both parties. Carborundum ended up roughly $42,000 to the good: $269,000 + $31,000 – $241,000 – $17,000, the last figure representing prejudgment interest on Lake River’s damages. (We have rounded off all dollar figures to the nearest thousand.) Both parties have appealed.</p>
<p class="indent">The hardest issue in the case is whether the formula in the minimum-guarantee clause imposes a penalty for breach of contract or is merely an effort to liquidate damages. Deep as the hostility to penalty clauses runs in the common law, we still might be inclined to question, if we thought ourselves free to do so, whether a modern court should refuse to enforce a penalty clause where the signator is a substantial corporation, well able to avoid improvident commitments. Penalty clauses provide <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page240" >240</span>an earnest of performance. The clause here enhanced Carborundum’s credibility in promising to ship the minimum amount guaranteed by showing that it was willing to pay the full contract price even if it failed to ship anything. On the other side it can be pointed out that by raising the cost of a breach of contract to the contract breaker, a penalty clause increases the risk to his other creditors; increases (what is the same thing and more, because bankruptcy imposes “deadweight” social costs) the risk of bankruptcy; and could amplify the business cycle by increasing the number of bankruptcies in bad times, which is when contracts are most likely to be broken. But since little effort is made to prevent businessmen from assuming risks, these reasons are no better than makeweights.</p>
<p class="indent">A better argument is that a penalty clause may discourage efficient as well as inefficient breaches of contract. Suppose a breach would cost the promisee $12,000 in actual damages but would yield the promisor $20,000 in additional profits. Then there would be a net social gain from breach. After being fully compensated for his loss the promisee would be no worse off than if the contract had been performed, while the promisor would be better off by $8,000. But now suppose the contract contains a penalty clause under which the promisor if he breaks his promise must pay the promisee $25,000. The promisor will be discouraged from breaking the contract, since $25,000, the penalty, is greater than $20,000, the profits of the breach; and a transaction that would have increased value will be forgone.</p>
<p class="indent">On this view, since compensatory damages should be sufficient to deter inefficient breaches (that is, breaches that cost the victim more than the gain to the contract breaker), penal damages could have no effect other than to deter some efficient breaches. But this overlooks the earlier point that the willingness to agree to a penalty clause is a way of making the promisor and his promise credible and may therefore be essential to inducing some value-maximizing contracts to be made. It also overlooks the more important point that the parties (always assuming they are fully competent) will, in deciding whether to include a penalty clause in their contract, weigh the gains against the costs—costs that include the possibility of discouraging an efficient breach somewhere down the road—and will include the clause only if the benefits exceed those costs as well as all other costs.</p>
<p class="indent">On this view the refusal to enforce penalty clauses is (at best) paternalistic—and it seems odd that courts should display parental solicitude for large corporations. But however this may be, we must be on guard to avoid importing our own ideas of sound public policy into an area where our proper judicial role is more than usually deferential. The responsibility for making innovations in the common law of Illinois rests with the courts of Illinois, and not with the federal courts in Illinois. And like every other state, Illinois, untroubled by academic skepticism of the wisdom of refusing to enforce penalty clauses against sophisticated promisors, continues steadfastly to insist on the distinction between penalties and liquidated damages. To <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page241" >241</span>be valid under Illinois law a liquidation of damages must be a reasonable estimate at the time of contracting of the likely damages from breach, and the need for estimation at that time must be shown by reference to the likely difficulty of measuring the actual damages from a breach of contract after the breach occurs. If damages would be easy to determine then, or if the estimate greatly exceeds a reasonable upper estimate of what the damages are likely to be, it is a penalty.</p>
<p class="indent">Mindful that Illinois courts resolve doubtful cases in favor of classification as a penalty, we conclude that the damage formula in this case is a penalty and not a liquidation of damages, because it is designed always to assure Lake River more than its actual damages. The formula—full contract price minus the amount already invoiced to Carborundum—is invariant to the gravity of the breach. When a contract specifies a single sum in damages for any and all breaches even though it is apparent that all are not of the same gravity, the specification is not a reasonable effort to estimate damages; and when in addition the fixed sum greatly exceeds the actual damages likely to be inflicted by a minor breach, its character as a penalty becomes unmistakable. This case is within the gravitational field of these principles even though the minimum-guarantee clause does not fix a single sum as damages.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose to begin with that the breach occurs the day after Lake River buys its new bagging system for $89,000 and before Carborundum ships any Ferro Carbo. Carborundum would owe Lake River $533,000. Since Lake River would have incurred at that point a total cost of only $89,000, its net gain from the breach would be $444,000. This is more than four times the profit of $107,000 (20 percent of the contract price of $533,000) that Lake River expected to make from the contract if it had been performed: a huge windfall.</p>
<p class="indent">Next suppose (as actually happened here) that breach occurs when 55 percent of the Ferro Carbo has been shipped. Lake River would already have received $293,000 from Carborundum. To see what its costs then would have been (as estimated at the time of contracting), first subtract Lake River’s anticipated profit on the contract of $107,000 from the total contract price of $533,000. The difference—Lake River’s total cost of performance—is $426,000. Of this, $89,000 is the cost of the new bagging system, a fixed cost. The rest ($426,000 – $89,000 = $337,000) presumably consists of variable costs that are roughly proportional to the amount of Ferro Carbo bagged; there is no indication of any other fixed costs. Assume, therefore, that if Lake River bagged 55 percent of the contractually agreed quantity, it incurred in doing so 55 percent of its variable costs, or $185,000.</p>
<p class="indent">When this is added to the cost of the new bagging system, assumed for the moment to be worthless except in connection with the contract, the total cost of performance to Lake River is $274,000. Hence a breach that occurred after 55 percent of contractual performance was complete would be expected to yield Lake <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page242" >242</span>River a modest profit of $19,000 ($293,000 – $274,000). But now add the “liquidated damages” of $241,000 that Lake River claims, and the result is a total gain from the breach of $260,000, which is almost two and a half times the profit that Lake River expected to gain if there was no breach. And this ignores any use value or salvage value of the new bagging system, which is the property of Lake River—though admittedly it also ignores the time value of money; Lake River paid $89,000 for that system before receiving any revenue from the contract.</p>
<p class="indent">To complete the picture, assume that the breach had not occurred till performance was 90 percent complete. Then the “liquidated damages” clause would not be so one-sided, but it would be one-sided. Carborundum would have paid $480,000 for bagging. Against this, Lake River would have incurred its fixed cost of $89,000 plus 90 percent of its variable costs of $337,000, or $303,000. Its total costs would thus be $392,000, and its net profit $88,000. But on top of this it would be entitled to “liquidated damages” of $53,000, for a total profit of $141,000—more than 30 percent more than its expected profit of $107,000 if there was no breach.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason for these results is that most of the costs to Lake River of performing the contract are saved if the contract is broken, and this saving is not reflected in the damage formula. As a result, at whatever point in the life of the contract a breach occurs, the damage formula gives Lake River more than its lost profits from the breach—dramatically more if the breach occurs at the beginning of the contract; tapering off at the end, it is true. Still, over the interval between the beginning of Lake River’s performance and nearly the end, the clause could be expected to generate profits ranging from 400 percent of the expected contract profits to 130 percent of those profits. And this is on the assumption that the bagging system has no value apart from the contract. If it were worth only $20,000 to Lake River, the range would be 434 percent to 150 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">Lake River argues that it would never get as much as the formula suggests, because it would be required to mitigate its damages. This is a dubious argument on several grounds. First, mitigation of damages is a doctrine of the law of court-assessed damages, while the point of a liquidated-damages clause is to substitute party assessment; and that point is blunted, and the certainty that liquidated-damages clauses are designed to give the process of assessing damages impaired, if a defendant can force the plaintiff to take less than the damages specified in the clause, on the ground that the plaintiff could have avoided some of them. It would seem therefore that the clause in this case should be read to eliminate any duty of mitigation, that what Lake River is doing is attempting to rewrite the clause to make it more reasonable, and that since actually the clause is designed to give Lake River the full damages it would incur from breach (and more) even if it made no effort to find a substitute use for the equipment that it bought to perform the contract, this is just <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page243" >243</span>one more piece of evidence that it is a penalty clause rather than a liquidated-damages clause.</p>
<p class="indent">But in any event mitigation would not mitigate the penal character of this clause. If Carborundum did not ship the guaranteed minimum quantity, the reason was likely to be—the reason was—that the steel industry had fallen on hard times and the demand for Ferro Carbo was therefore down. In these circumstances Lake River would have little prospect of finding a substitute contract that would yield it significant profits to set off against the full contract price, which is the method by which it proposes to take account of mitigation. At argument Lake River suggested that it might at least have been able to sell the new bagging equipment to someone for something, and the figure $40,000 was proposed. If the breach occurred on the first day when performance under the contract was due and Lake River promptly sold the bagging equipment for $40,000, its liquidated damages would fall to $493,000. But by the same token its costs would fall to $49,000. Its profit would still be $444,000, which as we said was more than 400 percent of its expected profit on the contract. The penal component would be unaffected.</p>
<p class="indent">With the penalty clause in this case compare the liquidated-damages clause in <span class="italic">Arduini v. Board of Education,</span> which is representative of such clauses upheld in Illinois. The plaintiff was a public school teacher whose contract provided that if he resigned before the end of the school year he would be docked 4 percent of his salary. This was a modest fraction of the contract price. And the cost to the school of an untimely resignation would be difficult to measure. Since that cost would be greater the more senior and experienced the teacher was, the fact that the liquidated damages would be greater the higher the teacher’s salary did not make the clause arbitrary. Even the fact that the liquidated damages were the same whether the teacher resigned at the beginning, the middle, or the end of the school year was not arbitrary, for it was unclear how the amount of actual damages would vary with the time of resignation. Although one might think that the earlier the teacher resigned the greater the damage to the school would be, the school might find it easier to hire a replacement for the whole year or a great part of it than to bring in a replacement at the last minute to grade the exams left behind by the resigning teacher. Here, in contrast, it is apparent from the face of the contract that the damages provided for by the “liquidated damages” clause are grossly disproportionate to any probable loss and penalize some breaches much more heavily than others regardless of relative cost.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not mean by this discussion to cast a cloud of doubt over the “take or pay” clauses that are a common feature of contracts between natural gas pipeline companies and their customers. Such clauses require the customer, in consideration of the pipeline’s extending its line to his premises, to take a certain amount of gas at <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page244" >244</span>a specified price—and if he fails to take it to pay the full price anyway. The resemblance to the minimum-guarantee clause in the present case is obvious, but perhaps quite superficial. Neither party has mentioned take-or-pay clauses, and we can find no case where such a clause was even challenged as a penalty clause—though in one case it was argued that such a clause made the damages unreasonably low. If, as appears not to be the case here but would often be the case in supplying natural gas, a supplier’s fixed costs were a very large fraction of his total costs, a take-or-pay clause might well be a reasonable liquidation of damages. In the limit, if all the supplier’s costs were incurred before he began supplying the customer, the contract revenues would be an excellent measure of the damages from breach. But in this case, the supplier (Lake River, viewed as a supplier of bagging services to Carborundum) incurred only a fraction of its costs before performance began, and the interruption of performance generated a considerable cost saving that is not reflected in the damage formula.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that the damage formula is invalid does not deprive Lake River of a remedy. The parties did not contract explicitly with reference to the measure of damages if the agreed-on damage formula was invalidated, but all this means is that the victim of the breach is entitled to his common law damages. In this case that would be the unpaid contract price of $241,000 minus the costs that Lake River saved by not having to complete the contract (the variable costs on the other 45 percent of the Ferro Carbo that it never had to bag). The case must be remanded to the district judge to fix these damages.</p>
<p id="sec120" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. Judge Posner says that on remand Lake River will be permitted to prove damages based on the contract price less savings (variable costs saved). Should it alternatively be permitted to recover its outlays in reliance less the present market value of the machinery it purchased? Recall <span class="italic">Anglia Television v. Reed</span>, p. 134. Which measure will yield a larger damages award?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. The doctrinal and policy concerns in <span class="italic">Lake River,</span> and in most reported liquidated damage cases, are whether the liquidated damages are set too high, overcompensate the injured party, encourage inefficient over-performance, and therefore run afoul of the penalty doctrine. Historically there has been scant concern in the courts about liquidated damages that are set so low that they operate as a limitation on liability. As a general doctrinal matter limitations on liability are enforceable in accordance with their terms, unless they are so extreme as to systematically deny an injured party any practical remedy or otherwise operate in an unconscionable manner. UCC-2-719. But as a matter of contract design (as opposed <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page245" >245</span>to doctrine) unreasonably low liquidated damages can raise the concern of encouraging inefficient breach. In one well known experiment, Uri Gneezy &amp; Aldo Rustichini, <span class="italic">A Fine is a Price</span>, 29 J. L<small>EG</small>. S<small>TUD</small>. 1 (2000), the researchers found that the number of late pick-ups from child care centers <b><span class="italic">doubled</span></b> after a small monetary penalty for each instance of late pick-up was introduced. Viewing payment of a small fine as an option, parents had less compunction about violating their contractual commitment to timely pick up their children. So, ironically, they breached more often after the introduction of the small monetary penalty than they did when there was no penalty at all. Going further, in three interesting studies conducted over the internet by Tess Wilkinson-Ryan, <span class="italic">Do Liquidated Damages Encourage Breach?: A Psychological Experiment</span>, 108 M<small>ICH</small>. L. R<small>EV</small>. 633 (2010), the research showed that liquidated damages (even those set at a slightly punitive level) had the effect of encouraging efficient breach as compared to a control condition where no liquidated amount was fixed in the parties’ agreement.</p>

<p class="sectionb">United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, 1987.</p>
<p class="sectionb">794 F.2d 1433, as modified, 811 F.2d 1264.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ N<small>OONAN</small>, J.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">C and H is an agricultural cooperative owned by fourteen sugar plantations in Hawaii. Its business consists in transporting raw sugar—the crushed cane in the form of coarse brown crystal—to its refinery in Crockett, California. Roughly one million tons a year of sugar are harvested in Hawaii. A small portion is refined there; the bulk goes to Crockett. The refined sugar—the white stuff—is sold by C and H to groceries for home consumption and to the soft drink and cereal companies that are its industrial customers.</p>
<p class="indent">To conduct its business, C and H has an imperative need for assured carriage for the raw sugar from the islands. Sugar is a seasonal crop, with 70 percent of the harvest occurring between April and October, while almost nothing is harvestable during December and January. Consequently, transportation must not only be available, but seasonably available. Storage capacity in Hawaii accommodates not more than a quarter of the crop. Left stored on the ground or left unharvested, sugar suffers the loss of sucrose and goes to waste. Shipping ready and able to carry the raw sugar is a priority for C and H.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page246" >246</div>
<p class="indent">In 1979 C and H was notified that Matson Navigation Company, which had been supplying the bulk of the necessary shipping, was withdrawing its services as of January 1981. While C and H had some ships at its disposal, it found a pressing need for a large new vessel, to be in service at the height of the sugar season in 1981. It decided to commission the building of a kind of hybrid—a tug of catamaran design with two hulls and, joined to the tug, a barge with a wedge which would lock between the two pontoons of the tug, producing an “integrated tug barge.” In Hawaiian, the barge and the entire vessel were each described as a Mocababoo or push boat.</p>
<p class="indent">C and H relied on the architectural advice of the New York firm, J.J. Henry. It solicited bids from shipyards, indicating as an essential term a “preferred delivery date” of June 1981. It decided to accept Sun’s offer to build the barge and Halter’s offer to build the tug.</p>
<p class="indent">In the fall of 1979 C and H entered into negotiations with Sun on the precise terms of the contract. Each company was represented by a vice-president with managerial responsibility in the area of negotiation; each company had a team of negotiators; each company had the advice of counsel in drafting the agreement that was signed on November 14, 1979. This agreement was entitled “Contract for the Construction of One Oceangoing Barge for California and Hawaiian Sugar Company By Sun Ship, Inc.” The “Whereas” clause of the contract identified C and H as the Purchaser, and Sun as the Contractor; it identified “one non-self-propelled oceangoing barge” as the Vessel that Purchaser was buying from Contractor. Article I provided that Contractor would deliver the Vessel on June 30, 1981. The contract price was $25,405,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Under Article I of the agreement, Sun was entitled to an extension of the delivery date for the usual types of force majeure and for “unavailability of the Tug to Contractor for joining to the Vessel, where it is determined that Contractor has complied with all obligations under the Interface Agreement.” (The Interface Agreement, executed the same day between C and H, Sun, and Halter provided that Sun would connect the barge with the tug.) Article 17 “Delivery” provided that “the Vessel shall be offered for delivery fully and completely connected with the Tug.” Article 8, “Liquidated Damages for Delay in Delivery” provided that if “Delivery of the Vessel” was not made on “the Delivery Date” of June 30, 1981, Sun would pay C and H “as per-day liquidated damages, and not as a penalty” a sum described as “a reasonable measure of the damages”—$17,000 per day.</p>
<p class="indent">On the same date C and H entered into an agreement with Halter to purchase “one oceangoing catamaran tug boat” for $20,350,000. The tug (the “Vessel” of that contract) was to be delivered on April 30, 1981 at Sun’s shipyard. Liquidated damages of $10,000 per day were provided for Halter’s failure to deliver.</p>
<p class="indent">Halter did not complete the tug until July 15, 1982. Sun did not complete the barge until March 16, 1982. Tug and barge were finally connected under C and H’s <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page247" >247</span>direction in mid-July 1982 and christened the <span class="italic">Moku Pahu</span>. C and H settled its claim against Halter. Although Sun paid C and H $17,000 per day from June 30, 1981 until January 10, 1982, it ultimately denied liability for any damages, and this lawsuit resulted.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>A<small>NALYSIS</small></b></p>
<p class="indent">Sun contends that its obligation was to deliver the barge connected to the tug on the delivery date of June 30, 1981 and that only the failure to deliver the integrated hybrid would have triggered the liquidated damage clause. It is true that Article 17 creates some ambiguity by specifying that the Vessel is to be “offered for delivery completely connected with the Tug.” The case of the barge being ready while the tug was not, is not explicitly considered. Nonetheless, the meaning of “Vessel” is completely unambiguous. From the “Whereas” clause to the articles of the agreement dealing with insurance, liens, and title, “the Vessel” is the barge. It would require the court to rewrite the contract to find that “the Vessel” in Article 8 on liquidated damages does not mean the barge. The article takes effect on failure to deliver “the Vessel”—that is, the barge.</p>
<p class="indent">Sun contends, however, that on such a reading of the contract, the $17,000 per day is a penalty, not to be enforced by the court. The barge, Sun points out, was useless to C and H without the tug. Unconnected, the barge was worse than useless—it was an expensive liability. C and H did not want the barge by itself. To get $17,000 per day as “damages” for failure to provide an unwanted and unusable craft is, Sun says, to exact a penalty. C and H seeks to be “paid according to the tenour of the bond”; it “craves the law.” And if C and H sticks to the letter of the bond, it must like Shylock end by losing; a court of justice will not be so vindictive. Breach of contract entitles the wronged party only to fair compensation.</p>
<p class="indent">Seductive as Sun’s argument is, it does not carry the day. Represented by sophisticated representatives, C and H and Sun reached the agreement that $17,000 a day was the reasonable measure of the loss C and H would suffer if the barge was not ready. Of course they assumed that the tug would be ready. But in reasonable anticipation of the damages that would occur if the tug was ready and the barge was not, Article 8 was adopted. As the parties foresaw the situation, C and H would have a tug waiting connection but no barge and so no shipping. The anticipated damages were what might be expected if C and H could not transport the Hawaiian sugar crop at the height of the season. Those damages were clearly before both parties. As Joe Kleschick, Sun’s chief negotiator, testified, he had “a vision” of a “mountain of sugar piling up in Hawaii”—a vision that C and H conjured up in negotiating the damage clause. Given the anticipated impact on C and H’s raw sugar and on C and H’s ability to meet the demands of its grocery and industrial customers if the sugar could not be transported, liquidated damages of $17,000 a day were completely reasonable.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page248" >248</div>
<p class="indent">The situation as it developed was different from the anticipation. The barge was not ready but neither was the tug. C and H was in fact able to find other shipping. The crop did not rot. The customers were not left sugarless. Sun argues that, measured by the actual damages suffered, the liquidated damages were penal.</p>
<p class="indent">We look to Pennsylvania law for guidance. Although no Pennsylvania case is squarely on point, it is probable that Pennsylvania would interpret the contract as a sale of goods governed by the Uniform Commercial Code. The governing statute provides that liquidated damages are considered reasonable “in the light of anticipated or actual harm.” 12A Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. 2–718(1) (Purdon 1970) (Pennsylvania’s adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code).</p>
<p class="indent">The choice of the disjunctive appears to be deliberate. The language chosen is in harmony with the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 (1979), which permits liquidated damages in the light of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the difficulties of proof of loss. Section 356, Comment b declares explicitly: “Furthermore, the amount fixed is reasonable to the extent that it approximates the loss anticipated at the time of the making of the contract, even though it may not approximate the actual loss.”</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the statutory disjunctive and the Restatement’s apparent blessing of it, the question is not settled by these authorities which must be read in the light of common law principles already established and accepted in Pennsylvania. Prior to the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, Pennsylvania enforced liquidated damage clauses that its courts labeled as nonpenal, but equitable considerations relating to the actual harm incurred were taken into account along with the difficulty of proving damages if a liquidated damage clause was rejected. We do not believe that the U.C.C. overrode this line of reasoning. Indeed, in a lower court case, decided after the U.C.C.’s enactment, it was stated that if liquidated damages appear unreasonable in light of the harm suffered, “the contractual provision will be voided as a penalty.” <span class="italic">Unit Vending Corp. v. Tobin Enterprises</span>, 194 Pa.Super. 470, 473 (1961). That case, however, is not on all fours with our case: Unit Vending involved an adhesion contract between parties of unequal bargaining power; the unfair contract was characterized by the court as “a clever attempt to secure both the penny and the cake” by the party with superior strength. Mechanically to read it as Pennsylvania law governing this case would be a mistake. The case, however, does show that Pennsylvania courts, like courts elsewhere, attempt to interpret the governing statute humanely and equitably.</p>
<p class="indent">The Restatement § 356 Comment b, after accepting anticipated damages as a measure, goes on to say that if the difficulty of proof of loss is slight, then actual damage may be the measure of reasonableness: “If, to take an extreme case, it is clear that no loss at all has occurred, a provision fixing a substantial sum as damages <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page249" >249</span>is unenforceable. See Illustration 4.” Illustration 4 is a case of a contractor, A, agreeing to build B’s race track by a specific date and to pay B $1,000 a day for every day’s delay. A delays a month, but B does not get permission to operate the track for that month, so B suffers no loss. In that event, the Restatement characterizes the $1,000 per day as an unenforceable penalty. Sun contends that it is in the position of A: no actual loss was suffered by C and H because C and H had no tug to mate with the barge.</p>
<p class="indent">This argument restates in a new form Sun’s basic contention that the liquidated damage clause was meant to operate only if the integrated tug barge was not delivered. The argument has been rejected by us as a misinterpretation of the contract. But in its new guise it gains appeal. If Illustration 4 is the present case, Sun is home scot-free. The Restatement, however, deals with a case where the defaulting contractor was alone in his default. We deal with a case of concurrent defaults. If we were to be so literal-minded as to follow the Restatement here, we would have to conclude that because both parties were in default, C and H suffered no damage until one party performed. Not until the barge was ready in March 1982 could C and H hold Halter for damages, and then only for the period after that date. The continued default of both parties would operate to take each of them off the hook. That cannot be the law.</p>
<p class="indent">Sun objects that Halter had a more absolute obligation to deliver than Sun did. Halter did not have to deliver the integrated tug, only the tug itself; it was not excused by Sun’s default. Hence the spectacle of two defaulting contractors causing no damages would not be presented here. But Sun’s objection does not meet the point that Halter’s unexcused delivery would, on Sun’s theory, have generated no damages. The tug by itself would have been no use to C and H.</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude, therefore, that in this case of concurrent causation each defaulting contractor is liable for the breach and for the substantial damages which the joint breach occasions. Sun is a substantial cause of the damages flowing from the lack of the integrated tug; Sun cannot be absolved by the absence of the tug.</p>
<p class="indent">Sun has a final argument. Even on the assumption that it is liable as a substantial cause of the breach of contract, Sun contends that the actual damages suffered by C and H for lack of the integrated tug boat were slight. Actual damages were found by the district court to consist of “interest on progress payments, unfavorable terms of conversion to long-term financing, and additional labor expense.” No dollar amount was determined by the district court in finding that these damages “bore a reasonable relationship to the amount liquidated in the Barge Contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">The dollar value of the damages found by the district judge is, to judge from C and H’s own computation, as follows:</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page250" >250</div>
<p class="image"><img src="./pg250.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="indent">But “actual damages” have no meaning if the actual savings of C and H due to the nondelivery of the integrated tug barge are not subtracted. It was clearly erroneous for the district judge to exclude these savings from his finding. These savings, again according to C and H’s own computation, were:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="./pg250a.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p class="indent">The net actual damages suffered by C and H were $368,000. As a matter of law, Sun contends that the liquidated damages are unreasonably disproportionate to the net actual damages.</p>
<p class="indent">C and H urges on us the precedent of <span class="italic">Bellefonte Borough Authority v. Gateway Equipment &amp; Supply Co.</span>, 442 Pa. 492 (1971), forfeiting a bid bond of $45,000 on the failure of a contractor to perform a municipal contract, even though the loss to the municipality was $1,000; the disproportion was 45 to 1. But that decision is not decisive here. It did not purport to apply the Uniform Commercial Code. Rules appropriate for bids to the government are sufficiently different from those applicable between private parties to prevent instant adoption of this precedent. A fuller look at relevant contract law is appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">Litigation has blurred the line between a proper and a penal clause, and the distinction is “not an easy one to draw in practice.” <span class="italic">Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co</span>., 769 F.2d 1284, 1290 (7th Cir.1985) (per Posner, J.). But the desire of courts to avoid the enforcement of penalties should not obscure common law principles followed in Pennsylvania. Contracts are contracts because they contain enforceable promises, and absent some overriding public policy, those promises are to be enforced. “Where each of the parties is content to take the risk of its turning out in a particular way” why should one “be released from the contract, if there were no misrepresentation or other want of fair dealing?” <span class="italic">Ashcom v. Smith</span>, 2 Pen. &amp; W. 211, 218–219 (Pa.1830) (per Gibson, C.J.). Promising to pay damages of a fixed amount, the parties normally have a much better sense of what damages can occur. Courts must be reluctant to override their judgment. Where damages are real but difficult to prove, injustice will be done the injured party if the court substitutes the requirements of judicial proof for the parties’ own informed agreement as to what is a <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page251" >251</span>reasonable measure of damages. Pennsylvania acknowledges that a seller is bound to pay consequential damages if the seller had reason to know of the buyer’s special circumstances. The liquidated damage clause here functions in lieu of a court’s determination of the consequential damages suffered by C and H.</p>
<p class="indent">These principles inform a leading common law case in the field, <span class="italic">Clydebank Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Yzquierdo y Castaneda</span>, 1905 A.C. 6. The defendant shipyard had agreed to pay 500 pounds per week per vessel for delay in the delivery of four torpedo boat destroyers to the Spanish Navy in 1897. The shipyard pointed out that had the destroyers been delivered on schedule they would have been sunk with the rest of the Spanish Navy by the Americans in 1898. The House of Lords found the defense unpersuasive. To prove damages the whole administration of the Spanish Navy would have had to have been investigated. The House of Lords refused to undertake such a difficult investigation when the parties had made an honest effort in advance to set in monetary terms what the lack of the destroyers would mean to Spain.</p>
<p class="indent">C and H is not the Spanish Navy, but the exact damages caused its manifold operations by lack of the integrated tug boat are equally difficult of ascertainment. Proof of its loss is difficult—as difficult, perhaps, as proof of loss would have been if the sugar crop had been delivered late because shipping was missing. Whatever the loss, the parties had promised each other that $17,000 per day was a reasonable measure. The court must decline to substitute the requirements of judicial proof for the parties’ own conclusion. The <span class="italic">Moku Pahu</span>, available on June 30, 1981, was a great prize, capable of multiple employments and enlarging the uses of the entire C and H fleet. When sophisticated parties with bargaining parity have agreed what lack of this prize would mean, and it is now difficult to measure what the lack did mean, the court will uphold the parties’ bargain. C and H is entitled to keep the liquidated damages of $3,298,000 it has already received and to receive additional liquidated damages of $1,105,000 with interest thereon, less setoffs determined by the district court.</p>

<p class="indent">AFFIRMED.</p>
<p id="sec122" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. In this case C &amp; H’s damages for late delivery of the barge are easy to compute in precisely the way the court did compute them. If the barge is delivered late, the loss will be however much it costs to “cover” by hiring other transportation for the sugar, less the savings from not having to operate the barge. Only if one assumes that there is no alternative transport available between Hawaii and California, a highly unlikely supposition, would there be any difficulty in calculating damages. <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page252" >252</span>Assuming that this is so, should the law allow the parties to fix damages by whatever measure they choose? That is, if C &amp; H, for its own reasons, wants to motivate Sun Ship to perform on time so it sets liquidated damages at $17,000 per day and Sun Ship freely agrees to this arrangement, why should the rest of us care? Putting the matter in slightly different form, should the law insist that contract damages be displaced by liquidated damages clauses only when it is difficult to compute actual damages or the rule in <span class="italic">Hadley v. Baxendale</span> is likely to foreclose the injured party from recovering losses actually suffered?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. Is it efficient to hold Sun Ship liable for damages under circumstances where prompt performance would be costly to it and yet result in no economic benefit to C &amp; H in light of Halter’s continuing delay?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. Given that neither the barge nor the tug were ready on time, if there were no liquidated damages clause, could Sun Ship, the barge builder, and Halter, the tug manufacturer, each point at the other and claim that its breach did not cause the damages, but that it was the other party’s fault? What does the court mean when it holds “each defaulting contractor … liable … for the substantial damages which the joint breach occasions”? Aren’t there actually separate breaches of independent contracts here rather than a joint breach? For a thorough analysis of the problem of allocating damages between Halter and Sun Ship, see Daniel J. Bussel, <span class="italic">Liability for Concurrent Breach of Contract</span>, 73 W<small>ASH</small>. U. L.Q. 97 (1995).</p>
<p class="indent"><b>4</b>. The Court of Appeals affirmed the award of $4,403,000 in liquidated damages to C &amp; H when the actual damages suffered were less than a tenth that amount, a mere $368,000. How disproportionate must the loss be from the actual damages before a court will attach the label “penalty” and invalidate the contract clause?</p>
<p class="indent">Compare the following statement by Judge Van Oosterhout in a similar situation in <span class="italic">Southwest Engineering Co. v. United States</span>, 341 F.2d 998, 1003 (8th Cir. 1965):</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">When parties have by their contract agreed upon a liquidated damages provision as a reasonable forecast of just compensation for breach of contract and damages are difficult to estimate accurately, such provision should be enforced. If in the course of subsequent developments, damages prove to be greater than those stipulated, the party entitled to damages is bound by the liquidated damages agreement. It is not unfair to hold the contractor performing the work to such agreement if by reason of later developments damages prove to be less or nonexistent. Each party by entering into such contractual provision took a calculated risk and is bound by reasonable contractual provisions pertaining to liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Doesn’t this approach eliminate the actual harm prong of the penalty doctrine? Consider, on the other hand, the dissenting judge’s view on a liquidated damages clause <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page253" >253</span>when there is no actual harm in <span class="italic">Barrie School v. Patch</span>, 933 A.2d 382, 396, 404 (Md. 2007) (dissenting):</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">It does not follow that merely because a contract contains a liquidated damages clause, which facially is not punitive, upon breach, damages in the amount stipulated automatically will be awarded to the non-breaching party….[W]here the non-breaching party has suffered no damages, or relatively insignificant damages in comparison to the stipulated sum, due to the breach…that fact must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority in <span class="italic">Barrie</span> this case, nevertheless, ruled that the validity of a liquidated damages clause is to be determined by “looking to the stipulated loss at the time of the contract’s formation, and not the actual losses resulting from breach.” It found the fact that the plaintiff suffered no actual damages irrelevant to the validity of the clause. Should actual damages be relevant to whether the liquidated damage clause operates as a penalty?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>5</b>. Even assuming that non-delivery of the barge could reasonably be anticipated to result in spoilage of the sugar crop, how could $17,000 per day have been a reasonable estimate of this future harm from Sun Ship’s breach? Consider whether it was likely that damages would run at the same rate whether it was sugar season or not. Consider how the estimated harm from non-delivery of the tug could be only $10,000 per day if $17,000 per day was the reasonable estimate of harm from nondelivery of the barge.</p>

<h3 id="sec124" class="section"><b>IV.    A<small>RBITRATION</small></b></h3>
<p class="bordercah" />
<p class="indent">We have seen that the law recognizes that parties possess at least limited power to define the remedies available for breach of their agreement. To the extent liquidated damages provisions are enforced, parties can tailor the remedial aspects of their relationship when the rules of law fail to meet their special needs. Another common device that can be used to the same end is the arbitration clause, which substitutes a decision by an arbitrator selected by the parties for the judgment of a court. The spotty history of arbitration clauses at common law is traced by Judge Jerome Frank in the excerpt that follows.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ F<small>RANK</small>, J. in <span id="sec125" class="italic">Kulukundis Shipping Co. v. Amtorg Trading Corp.</span>, 126 F.2d 978, 982–85 (2d Cir. 1942):</p>
<p class="indent">In considering these contentions in the light of the precedents, it is necessary to take into account the history of the judicial attitude towards arbitration: The English courts, while giving full effect to agreements to submit controversies to arbitration after they had ripened into arbitrators’ awards, would—over a long period beginning at the end of the 17th century—do little or nothing to prevent or make irksome the breach of such agreements when they were still executory.<sup><b><a id="fn_35" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-35" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></b></sup> Prior to 1687, such a breach could be made costly: a penal bond given to abide the result of an arbitration <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page255" >255</span>had a real bite, since a breach of the bond’s condition led to a judgment for the amount of the penalty. It was so held in 1609 in <span class="italic">Vynior’s Case</span>, 8 Coke Rep. 81b. To be sure, Coke there, in a dictum, citing precedents, dilated on the inherent revocability of the authority given to an arbitrator; such a revocation was not too important, however, if it resulted in a stiff judgment on a penal bond. But the Statute of Fines and Penalties (8 &amp; 9 Wm. III c. 11, § 8), enacted in 1687, provided that in an action on any bond given for performance of agreements, while judgment would be entered for the penalty, execution should issue only for the damages actually sustained. Coke’s dictum as to revocability, uttered seventy-eight years earlier, now took on a new significance, as it was now held that for breach of an undertaking to arbitrate the damages were only nominal. Recognizing the effect of the impact of this statute on executory arbitration agreements, Parliament, eleven years later, enacted a statute, 9 Wm. III c. 15 (1698), designed to remedy the situation by providing that, if an agreement to arbitrate so provided, it could be made a “rule of court” (i.e., a court order), in which event it became irrevocable, and one who revoked it would be subject to punishment for contempt of court; but the submission was revocable until such a rule of court had been obtained. This statute, limited in scope, was narrowly construed and was of little help. The ordinary executory arbitration agreement thus lost all real efficacy since it was not specifically enforceable in equity, and was held not to constitute the basis of a plea in bar in, or a stay of, a suit on the original cause of action. In admiralty, the rulings were much the same.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been well said that “the legal mind must assign some reason in order to decide anything with spiritual quiet.” And so, by way of rationalization, it became fashionable in the middle of the 18th century to say that such agreements were against public policy because they “oust the jurisdiction” of the courts. But that was a quaint explanation, inasmuch as an award, under an arbitration agreement, enforced both at law and in equity, was no less an ouster; and the same was true of releases and covenants not to sue, which were given full effect. Moreover, the agreement to arbitrate was not illegal, since suit could be maintained for its breach. Here was a clear instance of what Holmes called a “right” to break a contract and to substitute payment of damages for non-performance; as, in this type of case, the damages were only nominal, that “right” was indeed meaningful.</p>
<p class="indent">An effort has been made to justify this judicial hostility to the executory arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitrations, if unsupervised by the courts, are undesirable, and that legislation was needed to make possible such supervision. But if that was the reason for unfriendliness to such executory agreements, then the courts should also have refused to aid arbitrations when they ripened into awards. And what the English courts, especially the equity courts, did in other contexts, shows that, if they had had the will, they could have devised means of protecting <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page256" >256</span>parties to arbitrations. Instead, they restrictively interpreted successive statutes intended to give effect to executory arbitrations. No similar hostility was displayed by the Scotch courts. Lord Campbell explained the English attitude as due to the desire of the judges, at a time when their salaries came largely from fees, to avoid loss of income. Indignation has been voiced at this suggestion; perhaps it is unjustified. Perhaps the true explanation is the hypnotic power of the phrase, “oust the jurisdiction.” Give a bad dogma a good name and its bite may become as bad as its bark.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1855, in <span class="italic">Scott v. Avery</span>, 5 H.C.L. 811, the tide seemed to have turned. There it was held that if a policy made an award of damages by arbitrators a condition precedent to a suit on the policy, a failure to submit to arbitration would preclude such a suit, even if the policy left to the arbitrators the consideration of all the elements of liability. But, despite later legislation, the hostility of the English courts to executory arbitrations resumed somewhat after <span class="italic">Scott v. Avery</span>, and seems never to have been entirely dissipated.</p>
<p class="indent">That English attitude was largely taken over in the 19th century by most courts in this country. Indeed, in general, they would not go as far as <span class="italic">Scott v. Avery</span>, and continued to use the “ouster of jurisdiction” concept: An executory agreement to arbitrate would not be given specific performance or furnish the basis of a stay of proceedings on the original cause of action. Nor would it be given effect as a plea in bar, except in limited instances, i.e., in the case of an agreement expressly or impliedly making it a condition precedent to litigation that there be an award determining some preliminary question of subsidiary fact upon which any liability was to be contingent. In the case of broader executory agreements, no more than nominal damages would be given for a breach.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally speaking, then, the courts of this country were unfriendly to executory arbitration agreements. The lower federal courts, feeling bound to comply with the precedents, nevertheless became critical of this judicial hostility. There were intimations in the Supreme Court that perhaps the old view might be abandoned, but in the cases hinting at that newer attitude the issue was not raised. Effective state arbitration statutes were enacted beginning with the New York Statute of 1920.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted arbitration statutes modeled on either the 1955 Uniform Arbitration Act promulgated by the National Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, or its successor, the 2000 Revised Uniform Arbitration Act. 7 U.L.A. § 1 <span class="italic">et seq.</span> In addition, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 <span class="italic">et seq.</span>, embodying a federal policy favoring arbitration in matters touching on interstate commerce, broadly preempts state laws denying or limiting enforcement of contractual arbitration provisions.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page257" >257</div>
<p class="indent">Arbitration has long been the dominant means of enforcing collective bargaining agreements, including resolving labor contract grievances and disputes. In addition, a large and steadily increasing portion of commercial agreements contain arbitration clauses that remove dispute resolution from the courts. Many major institutions (and some entire industries) insist on arbitration clauses in all their agreements. Industries with strong trade associations often provide arbitration procedures for the resolution of disputes involving members and their customers, including, notably, the securities industry. Many construction contracts are based on the standard forms of the American Institute of Architects, which provide for arbitration of all disputes. Increasingly, standard form sales documents will include an arbitration provision among the “boiler plate” printed clauses. In international transactions, arbitration clauses provide a convenient way to avoid foreign and potentially hostile court systems. The United States and 155 other nations (including all our major trading partners) have acceded to the UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, popularly known as the New York Convention. The New York Convention greatly simplifies, and therefore promotes, the use of arbitration in international transactions by making the enforcement of an arbitration award simpler and often more certain than the enforcement of a foreign court judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">Arbitration is primarily a mechanism for the resolution of disputes that may arise in the future. It can also, however, substitute for contract preplanning if the parties cannot agree in advance on how to deal with a known contract issue. Instead of specifying the rights and liabilities of the parties in a given situation, the parties may authorize an arbitrator to declare their rights should the situation require. Used in this way, the arbitration clause may tend to swallow up the substantive provisions of the contract.</p>

<p class="indent">Where the parties are negotiating a long-term relationship, an impasse or delay caused by excessively detailed provision drafting can destroy the aura of good feeling previously carefully constructed and nurtured. Joint ventures, and many license and acquisition agreement negotiations, find the parties like prospective marriage partners. They are skittish enough without having to consider what they will do when they argue or want a divorce at some future date. Counsel often risks losing a favorable opportunity for his client if he insists on negotiating detailed contract provisions <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page258" >258</span>to cover contingencies beyond both parties’ control which may or may not occur in the future. An arbitration clause properly drafted can provide a vehicle for resolution of such matters if they arise and avoid bogging down negotiations. For example, a new process being licensed may have one or two known uses which can adequately be dealt with in the agreement. But both parties may sincerely believe that other uses will develop during the course of the agreement. The licensee naturally wishes complete assurance that he will be free to use the process in this projected new manner paying a just royalty. The licensor often wishes to encourage search for new applications for its process but fears inadequate compensation. There are a number of ways to resolve such impasses. But one which you should consider is an arbitration provision which provides for third party resolution of disputes as to royalty rate for new applications should the parties be unable to resolve the matter between themselves. Similarly, arbitration clauses can be used as safety valves where fears develop that a royalty rate, presently satisfactory, will prove destructive after future market price erosion, or process or product obsolescence.</p>
<p class="indent">Arbitration clauses can also be used in those situations where the prospective partners <span class="italic">know</span> they are going to clash and wish outside expert assistance. For example, in one recent acquisition negotiation involving a United States company as purchaser and an Italian seller, the purchaser was willing to pay a specified price per share only if earnings proved to be as represented. As many of you may know, one cannot determine what many Italian or other companies are earning by looking at their balance sheets or tax returns. Often several sets of books are kept. And so the parties agreed that each would retain a U.S. based accounting firm to audit and recast the Italian company’s books. If both accounting firms could agree on the treatment of a particular item under U.S. accounting principles, there would be no problem. But if they could not, they were authorized to choose a third firm from an agreed list whose determination would be final.</p>
<p class="indent">If the parties had attempted to draft provisions to determine which of the many conflicting U.S. accounting principles would apply in several dozen different situations, they would have never been able to leave the negotiating table. This unusual arbitration clause avoided this problem. It also served the very important purpose of avoiding a situation where the principals would be calling into question each other’s principles. The agreement provided for insulation of the clients from these often arcane disputes.</p>
<p class="indent">Arbitration clauses can also be useful in assisting parties to resolve disputes which arise in the course of a projected long-term collaboration without souring that relationship. Anyone who has ever engaged in international negotiations knows that “face” is important … to nearly all nationalities. (Indeed, I would venture to guess that more prospective mergers between two U.S. companies founder because of problems of “face” and “status” among the executives of the prospective partners <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page259" >259</span>than one might suspect from press reports.) We can learn from the Japanese and Chinese in this respect.</p>
<p class="blockquote">In a recent article in <span class="italic">The Business Lawyer</span>, the author noted that</p>
<p class="blockquote">In Japan a person who asserts rigid legal rights is thought to be “inflexible” and selfish. The businessman never introduces a lawyer into a domestic business conference. Introduction of a lawyer into a business conference is thought to be an unfriendly act, an act equal to an explicit threat of litigation.</p>
<p class="indent">The author concludes that the Japanese feel that every practical problem should be solved by mutual compromise and accommodation, “regardless of formal rights and obligations.”</p>
<p class="indent">Those who have engaged in negotiating sessions with the mainland Chinese have found that “* * * the Chinese will go to great lengths to avoid any kind of formal arbitration over the disagreements, problems and tensions which eventually arise in international business. All Chinese contracts have a clause requiring disagreements be settled through ‘friendly negotiations’ first, before arbitration.”</p>
<p class="indent">All this is contrary to the instinct of many U.S. counsel not engaged in international practice. Many U.S. counsel insist upon an arbitration provision providing that arbitration can be speedily invoked with a prompt judicially enforceable decision to follow. But in long-term relationships such as joint ventures, where many future dispute areas can be identified which may be important yet not go to the heart of the relationship, a simple arbitration proceeding, resulting in a clear victory or defeat, may prove too destructive. Any victory will be pyrrhic if it makes future cooperation problematical.</p>
<p class="indent">In such circumstances, whether international or domestic relationships are involved, counsel should seriously consider contractual vehicles that allow parties to reason together. For example, there are joint venture agreements which provide that where there are disputes which the operational representatives of each party cannot resolve, they are to call in senior management members of the parent companies to arbitrate or mediate the dispute informally. Some agreements have provided for several layers of this type of informal arbitration—internal appeals courts which may dissipate the heat of the moment. I should emphasize that these are circumstances where preservation of the relationship between the parties is of profound importance. Thus, efforts at inter-party resolution are institutionalized by the agreement which requires that the party resort to this before turning to more traditional and formal arbitration proceedings. Those of you familiar with labor-management disputes will note the similarity of the foregoing contract provisions with grievance mechanisms. The analogy is well taken. The important characteristic here is the provision of a system to which the parties may resort without loss of “face.” In effect, these agreements provide that joint venture managers <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page260" >260</span>must turn to avuncular senior management for help in resolving disputes before proceeding further. Although one might think that this is what they would do in any event, providing for this procedure in the agreement has been found most constructive where the heat of the moment obscures reason.</p>
<p class="indent">It is interesting to note that the laws of several countries permit parties to statutory arbitrations to request the legally appointed arbitrator or mediator to conciliate before arriving at a decision. These proceedings, as well as the informal internal arbitrations I have just described, are much more subtle than the head-chopping, calendar-busting settlement sessions some counsel have suffered through in crowded courts. However, they share this in common: a strong incentive to the parties to settle the dispute is the recognition that failure will result in a formal win-lose decision. In long-term relationships, as in marriage, it is often wise to forego clear-cut victories or defeats.</p>

<p class="sectionb">Supreme Court of the United States, 2006.</p>
<p class="sectionb">126 S.Ct. 1204.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ S<small>CALIA</small>, J., delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">We decide whether a court or an arbitrator should consider the claim that a contract containing an arbitration provision is void for illegality.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>I</b></p>
<p class="indent">Respondents John Cardegna and Donna Reuter entered into various deferredpayment transactions with petitioner Buckeye Check Cashing (Buckeye), in which they received cash in exchange for a personal check in the amount of the cash plus a finance charge. For each separate transaction they signed a “Deferred Deposit and Disclosure Agreement” (Agreement), which included the following arbitration provisions:</p>
<p class="blockquotes">“1. <span class="italic">Arbitration Disclosure</span> By signing this Agreement, you agree that i[f] a dispute of any kind arises out of this Agreement or your application therefore or any instrument relating thereto, th[e]n either you or we or third-parties involved can choose to have that dispute resolved by binding arbitration as set forth in Paragraph 2 below ….</p>
<p class="blockquotes">2. <span class="italic">Arbitration Provisions</span> Any claim, dispute, or controversy … arising from or relating to this Agreement … or the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the entire Agreement (collectively ‘Claim’), shall be resolved, upon the election of you or us or said third-parties, by binding arbitration …. This arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page261" >261</span>by the Federal Arbitration Act (‘FAA’). The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law constraint <span class="italic">[sic]</span> with the FAA and applicable statu[t]es of limitations and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law … .”</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents brought this putative class action in Florida state court, alleging that Buckeye charged usurious interest rates and that the Agreement violated various Florida lending and consumer-protection laws, rendering it criminal on its face. Buckeye moved to compel arbitration. The trial court denied the motion, holding that a court rather than an arbitrator should resolve a claim that a contract is illegal and void <span class="italic">ab initio</span>. The District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Fourth District reversed, holding that because respondents did not challenge the arbitration provision itself, but instead claimed that the entire contract was void, the agreement to arbitrate was enforceable, and the question of the contract’s legality should go to the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents appealed, and the Florida Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that to enforce an agreement to arbitrate in a contract challenged as unlawful “‘could breathe life into a contract that not only violates state law, but also is criminal in nature….’”</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>II</b></p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>A</b></p>
<p class="indent">To overcome judicial resistance to arbitration, Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Section 2 embodies the national policy favoring arbitration and places arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts:</p>
<p class="blockquote">“A written provision in … a contract … to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract … or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract … shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.”</p>
<p class="indent">Challenges to the validity of arbitration agreements “upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract” can be divided into two types. One type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate. The other challenges the contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement (<span class="italic">e.g.,</span> the agreement was fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contract’s provisions renders the whole contract invalid.<sup><b><a id="fn_37" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-37" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></b></sup> Respondents’ claim is of this second type. The crux of the complaint is that the <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page262" >262</span>contract as a whole (including its arbitration provision) is rendered invalid by the usurious finance charge.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</span> we addressed the question of who—court or arbitrator—decides these two types of challenges. The issue in the case was “whether a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is to be resolved by the federal court, or whether the matter is to be referred to the arbitrators.” <span class="italic">Id</span>., at 402. Guided by § 4 of the FAA,<sup><b><a id="fn_38" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-38" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></b></sup> we held that “if the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself—an issue which goes to the making of the agreement to arbitrate—the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it. But the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.” <span class="italic">Id.,</span> at 403-404. We rejected the view that the question of “severability” was one of state law, so that if state law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge to the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.</p>
<p class="indent">Subsequently, in <span class="italic">Southland Corp.,</span> we held that the FAA “create[d] a body of federal substantive law,” which was “applicable in state and federal court.” 465 U.S., at 12. We rejected the view that state law could bar enforcement of § 2, even in the context of state-law claims brought in state court.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>B</b></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Prima Paint</span> and <span class="italic">Southland</span> answer the question presented here by establishing three propositions. First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract. Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract’s validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance. Third, this arbitration law applies in state as well as federal courts. The parties have not requested, and we do not undertake, reconsideration of those holdings. Applying them to this case, we conclude that because respondents challenge the Agreement, but not specifically its arbitration provisions, those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract. The challenge should therefore be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page263" >263</div>
<p class="indent">In declining to apply <span class="italic">Prima Paint’s</span> rule of severability, the Florida Supreme Court relied on the distinction between void and voidable contracts. “Florida public policy and contract law,” it concluded, permit “no severable, or salvageable, parts of a contract found illegal and void under Florida law. <span class="italic">Prima Paint</span> makes this conclusion irrelevant. That case rejected application of state severability rules to the arbitration agreement <span class="italic">without discussing</span> whether the challenge at issue would have rendered the contract void or voidable. Indeed, the opinion expressly disclaimed any need to decide what state-law remedy was available (though Justice Black’s dissent <span class="italic">asserted</span> that state law rendered the contract void). Likewise in <span class="italic">Southland,</span> which arose in state court, we did not ask whether the several challenges made there—fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the California Franchise Investment Law—would render the contract void or voidable. We simply rejected the proposition that the enforceability of the arbitration agreement turned on the state legislature’s judgment concerning the forum for enforcement of the state-law cause of action. So also here, we cannot accept the Florida Supreme Court’s conclusion that enforceability of the arbitration agreement should turn on “Florida public policy and contract law.”</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents point to the language of § 2, which renders “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable” “a written provision in” or “an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of” a “contract.” Since, respondents argue, the only arbitration agreements to which § 2 applies are those involving a “contract,” and since an agreement void <span class="italic">ab initio</span> under state law is not a “contract,” there is no “written provision” in or “controversy arising out of” a “contract,” to which § 2 can apply. This argument echoes Justice Black’s dissent in <span class="italic">Prima Paint:</span> “Sections 2 and 3 of the Act assume the existence of a valid contract. They merely provide for enforcement where such a valid contract exists.” 388 U.S., at 412-413. We do not read “contract” so narrowly. The word appears four times in § 2. Its last appearance is in the final clause, which allows a challenge to an arbitration provision “upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any <span class="italic">contract</span>.” (Emphasis added.) There can be no doubt that “contract” as used this last time must include contracts that later prove to be void. Otherwise, the grounds for revocation would be limited to those that rendered a contract voidable—which would mean (implausibly) that an arbitration agreement could be challenged as voidable but not as void. Because the sentence’s final use of “contract” so obviously includes putative contracts, we will not read the same word earlier in the same sentence to have a more narrow meaning.<sup><b><a id="fn_39" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-39" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></b></sup> We note that neither <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page264" >264</span><span class="italic">Prima Paint</span> nor <span class="italic">Southland</span> lends support to respondents’ reading; as we have discussed, neither case turned on whether the challenge at issue would render the contract voidable or void.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">It is true, as respondents assert, that the <span class="italic">Prima Paint</span> rule permits a court to enforce an arbitration agreement in a contract that the arbitrator later finds to be void. But it is equally true that respondents’ approach permits a court to deny effect to an arbitration provision in a contract that the court later finds to be perfectly enforceable. <span class="italic">Prima Paint</span> resolved this conundrum—and resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions. We reaffirm today that, regardless of whether the challenge is brought in federal or state court, a challenge to the validity of the contract as a whole, and not specifically to the arbitration clause, must go to the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="indent">The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. In spite of, or perhaps because of, the strong pro-arbitration stance adopted by the Supreme Court, the impartiality of arbitrators designated in consumer contracts has come under attack. Notoriously, arbitrators employed in consumer debtcollection cases, especially credit card cases, are overwhelmingly likely to find in favor of the creditor (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> card issuer) and against the consumer in processing disputes. In 2009, the Minnesota Attorney General sued the National Arbitration Forum (NAF), the nation’s largest arbitration firm, alleging that the NAF was concealing its financial ties to collection agencies and credit card companies. The NAF is controlled by Accretive LLC, a private “hedge fund” that also controls major debt collection firms. The NAF was designated as the arbitrator in numerous credit card agreements in which Accretive’s affiliates served as the debt collectors. The NAF’s affiliation with Accretive, coupled with Accretive’s control of large debt collectors, raised concerns about the NAF’s impartiality in arbitrating credit card disputes in <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page265" >265</span>which its affiliates were interested. <span class="italic">See</span> Complaint, <span class="italic">Swanson v. National Arbitration Forum</span>, Case No. 27CV0918550 (D. Minn. July 14, 2009). After the filing of this Complaint, the NAF entered into a settlement with the Minnesota authorities under which it agreed it would no longer arbitrate consumer credit card disputes. <span class="italic">Firm Agrees to End Role in Arbitrating Card Debt</span>, N.Y. T<small>IMES</small>, July 20, 2009, at B8. At about the same time, the American Arbitration Association (AAA) also agreed to cease arbitrating disputes between customers and credit card companies. Robin Sidel &amp; Amol Sharma, <span class="italic">Credit Card Disputes Tossed Into Disarray</span>, W<small>ALL</small> S<small>T</small>. J., July 22, 2009, at A1.

<p class="blockquote">This is a classic case of the little guy getting stepped on by fine print contracts. The company tells consumers, the public, courts, and the government that it is independent and operates like an impartial court system.

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">National Arbitration Forum Barred from Credit Card and Consumer Arbitrations Under Agreement with Attorney General Swanson</span> (July 20, 2009) (available at http://www.ag.state.mn.us/). The concerns were in part addressed by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010). After a long period of study the CFPB has recently promulgated new proposed rules regulating the scope, use and enforcement of mandatory pre-dispute arbitration clauses in consumer financial agreements under its regulatory purview. 12 CFR § 1040 (May 5, 2016). This rule is highly controversial and is likely to be tested in the courts should it become final in the summer of 2017 as is presently anticipated.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. Most of the world sharply distinguishes between the arbitration of commercial disputes between businesses (which is strongly favored) and the arbitration of disputes involving private individuals in the role of employee or consumer. Mandatory pre-dispute arbitration clauses in consumer and employment agreements are either prohibited or regulated in these non-U.S. jurisdictions. Thomas J. Stipanowich, <span class="italic">The Third Arbitration Trilogy</span>, A<small>M</small>. R<small>EV</small>. I<small>NT</small>’<small>L</small> A<small>RB</small>. 323, 407-421 (2011) (discussing EU, UK, Canada, Japan, Brazil and New Zealand law). Set in this global context the federal prohibition of such regulation under the Supreme Court’s expansive reading of the hundred-year-old Federal Arbitration Act can be fairly characterized as anomalous. But the United States default mechanism for <b><span class="italic">adjudication</span></b> of such individual disputes is also highly anomalous. No other nation employs jury trials, contingent fee arrangements and liberal class action procedures in the way they are available in most American jurisdictions.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. <span class="italic">Buckeye Check Cashing</span> effectively permits a check cashing firm allegedly extracting criminally usurious interest and violating various consumer protection statutes as a matter of routine business practice to insulate itself not only from courts and juries, but also from a statewide class action procedure. That procedure permits small claimants to aggregate their claims and obtain class-wide relief in circumstances where it is uneconomic for individuals to assert individual claims because the amounts at stake are too small on an individual basis to justify the costs of litigation. The use of arbitration clauses to effectively preclude consumer class action litigation has been a matter of continuing controversy. The California Supreme Court took the position that enforcement of arbitration clauses expressly precluding class action type relief in such circumstances is unconscionable as a matter of California law. The Supreme Court of the United States, however, construed the Federal Arbitration Act to require a different result in the following case.</p>

<p class="indent">Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) makes agreements to arbitrate “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.

<p class="center_hd"><b>I</b></p>
<p class="indent">In February 2002, Vincent and Liza Concepcion entered into an agreement for the sale and servicing of cellular telephones with AT &amp; T Mobility. The contract provided for arbitration of all disputes between the parties, but required that claims be brought in the parties’ “individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.”<sup><b><a id="fn_40" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-40" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></b></sup> The agreement authorized AT&amp;T to make unilateral amendments, which it did to the arbitration provision on several occasions. The version at issue in this case reflects revisions made in December 2006, which the parties agree are controlling.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page267" >267</div>
<p class="indent">The revised agreement provides that customers may initiate dispute proceedings by completing a one-page Notice of Dispute form available on AT&amp;T’s Web site. AT&amp;T may then offer to settle the claim; if it does not, or if the dispute is not resolved within 30 days, the customer may invoke arbitration by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, also available on AT&amp;T’s Web site. In the event the parties proceed to arbitration, the agreement specifies that AT&amp;T must pay all costs for nonfrivolous claims; that arbitration must take place in the county in which the customer is billed; that, for claims of $10,000 or less, the customer may choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submissions; that either party may bring a claim in small claims court in lieu of arbitration; and that the arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and presumably punitive damages. The agreement, moreover, denies AT&amp;T any ability to seek reimbursement of its attorney’s fees, and, in the event that a customer receives an arbitration award greater than AT&amp;T’s last written settlement offer, requires AT&amp;T to pay a $7,500 minimum recovery and twice the amount of the claimant’s attorney’s fees.<sup><b><a id="fn_41" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-41" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></b></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Concepcions purchased AT&amp;T service, which was advertised as including the provision of free phones; they were not charged for the phones, but they were charged $30.22 in sales tax based on the phones’ retail value. In March 2006, the Concepcions filed a complaint against AT&amp;T in the Southern District of California. The complaint was later consolidated with a putative class action alleging, among other things, that AT&amp;T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.</p>
<p class="indent">In March 2008, AT&amp;T moved to compel arbitration under the terms of its contract with the Concepcions. The Concepcions opposed the motion, contending that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully exculpatory under California law because it disallowed classwide procedures. The District Court denied AT&amp;T’s motion. It described AT&amp;T’s arbitration agreement favorably, noting, for example, that the informal dispute-resolution process was “quick, easy to use” and likely to “promp[t] full or … even excess payment to the customer <span class="italic">without</span> the need to arbitrate or litigate”; that the $7,500 premium functioned as “a substantial inducement for the consumer to pursue the claim in arbitration” if a dispute was not resolved informally; and that consumers who were members of a class would likely be worse off. Nevertheless, relying on the California Supreme Court’s decision in <span class="italic">Discover Bank v. Superior Court</span> (Cal. 2005), the court found that the arbitration provision was unconscionable because AT&amp;T had not shown that bilateral arbitration adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class actions.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page268" >268</div>
<p class="indent">The Ninth Circuit affirmed, also finding the provision unconscionable under California law as announced in <span class="italic">Discover Bank.</span> It also held that the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule was not preempted by the FAA because that rule was simply “a refinement of the unconscionability analysis applicable to contracts generally in California.” In response to AT&amp;T’s argument that the Concepcions’ interpretation of California law discriminated against arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected the contention that “‘class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and expeditiousness of arbitration’” and noted that “‘<span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> placed arbitration agreements with class action waivers on the <span class="italic">exact same footing</span> as contracts that bar class action litigation outside the context of arbitration.’”</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>II</b></p>
<p class="indent">The FAA was enacted in 1925 in response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration agreements. See <span class="italic">Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.</span> (U.S. 2008). Section 2, the “primary substantive provision of the Act,” <span class="italic">Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital</span> (U.S. 1983), provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction … shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.</p>
<p class="indent">We have described this provision as reflecting both a “liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,” <span class="italic">Moses H. Cone</span> and the “fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract,” <span class="italic">Rent–A–Center</span> (U.S. 2010). In line with these principles, courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, <span class="italic">Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna</span> (U.S. 2006), and enforce them according to their terms, <span class="italic">Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</span> (U.S.1989).</p>
<p class="indent">The final phrase of § 2, however, permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable “upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” This saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by “generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability,” but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue. The question in this case is whether § 2 preempts California’s rule classifying most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer contracts as unconscionable. We refer to this rule as the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule.</p>
<p class="indent">Under California law, courts may refuse to enforce any contract found “to have been unconscionable at the time it was made,” or may “limit the application of any unconscionable clause.” Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1670.5(a). A finding of unconscionability requires “a ‘procedural’ and a ‘substantive’ element, the former focusing on <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page269" >269</span>‘oppression’ or ‘surprise’ due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on ‘overly harsh’ or ‘one-sided’ results.” <span class="italic">Armendariz v. Foundation Health Pyschcare Servs., Inc.</span> (Cal. 2000); accord, <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">Discover Bank,</span> the California Supreme Court applied this framework to classaction waivers in arbitration agreements and held as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“[W]hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages, and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, then … the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party ‘from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another.’ Under these circumstances, such waivers are unconscionable under California law and should not be enforced.”</p>
<p class="indent">California courts have frequently applied this rule to find arbitration agreements unconscionable.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>III</b></p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>A</b></p>
<p class="indent">The Concepcions argue that the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule, given its origins in California’s unconscionability doctrine and California’s policy against exculpation, is a ground that “exist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract” under FAA § 2. Moreover, they argue that even if we construe the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule as a prohibition on collective-action waivers rather than simply an application of unconscionability, the rule would still be applicable to all dispute-resolution contracts, since California prohibits waivers of class litigation as well.</p>
<p class="indent">When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA. But the inquiry becomes more complex when a doctrine normally thought to be generally applicable, such as duress or, as relevant here, unconscionability, is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration. In <span class="italic">Perry v. Thomas</span> (U.S.1987), for example, we noted that the FAA’s preemptive effect might extend even to grounds traditionally thought to exist “‘at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.’” We said that a court may not “rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would enable the court to effect what … the state legislature cannot.”</p>
<p class="indent">An obvious illustration of this point would be a case finding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public policy consumer arbitration agreements that fail to provide for judicially monitored discovery. The rationalizations for such a holding <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page270" >270</span>are neither difficult to imagine nor different in kind from those articulated in <span class="italic">Discover Bank.</span> A court might reason that no consumer would knowingly waive his right to full discovery, as this would enable companies to hide their wrongdoing. Or the court might simply say that such agreements are exculpatory—restricting discovery would be of greater benefit to the company than the consumer, since the former is more likely to be sued than to sue. See <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> (arguing that class waivers are similarly one-sided). And, the reasoning would continue, because such a rule applies the general principle of unconscionability or public-policy disapproval of exculpatory agreements, it is applicable to “any” contract and thus preserved by § 2 of the FAA. In practice, of course, the rule would have a disproportionate impact on arbitration agreements; but it would presumably apply to contracts purporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Other examples are easy to imagine. The same argument might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable arbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition by a jury (perhaps termed “a panel of twelve lay arbitrators” to help avoid preemption). Such examples are not fanciful, since the judicial hostility towards arbitration that prompted the FAA had manifested itself in “a great variety” of “devices and formulas” declaring arbitration against public policy. And although these statistics are not definitive, it is worth noting that California’s courts have been more likely to hold contracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts. Broome, <span class="italic">An Unconscionable Applicable of the Unconscionability Doctrine: How the California Courts are Circumventing the Federal Arbitration Act</span>, 3 H<small>ASTINGS</small> B<small>US</small>. L.J. 39, 54, 66 (2006); Randall, <span class="italic">Judicial Attitudes Toward Arbitration and the Resurgence of Unconscionability</span>, 52 B<small>UFFALO</small> L.R<small>EV</small>. 185, 186–187 (2004).</p>
<p class="indent">The Concepcions suggest that all this is just a parade of horribles, and no genuine worry. “Rules aimed at destroying arbitration” or “demanding procedures incompatible with arbitration,” they concede, “would be preempted by the FAA because they cannot sensibly be reconciled with Section 2.” The “grounds” available under § 2’s saving clause, they admit, “should not be construed to include a State’s mere preference for procedures that are incompatible with arbitration and ‘would wholly eviscerate arbitration agreements.’”</p>
<p class="indent">We largely agree. Although § 2’s saving clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses, nothing in it suggests an intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA’s objectives. As we have said, a federal statute’s saving clause “ ‘cannot in reason be construed as [allowing] a common law right, the continued existence of which would be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions of the act. In other words, the act cannot be held to destroy itself.’ ” <span class="italic">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</span> (U.S.1998).</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page271" >271</div>
<p class="indent">We differ with the Concepcions only in the application of this analysis to the matter before us. We do not agree that rules requiring judicially monitored discovery or adherence to the Federal Rules of Evidence are “a far cry from this case.” The overarching purpose of the FAA, evident in the text of §§ 2, 3, and 4, is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings. Requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>B</b></p>
<p class="indent">The “principal purpose” of the FAA is to “ensur[e] that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.” <span class="italic">Volt</span>; see also <span class="italic">Stolt–Nielsen S.A.</span> (U.S. 2010). This purpose is readily apparent from the FAA’s text. Section 2 makes arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable” as written (subject, of course, to the saving clause); § 3 requires courts to stay litigation of arbitral claims pending arbitration of those claims “in accordance with the terms of the agreement”; and § 4 requires courts to compel arbitration “in accordance with the terms of the agreement” upon the motion of either party to the agreement (assuming that the “making of the arbitration agreement or the failure … to perform the same” is not at issue). In light of these provisions, we have held that parties may agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration, <span class="italic">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</span> (U.S.1985), to arbitrate according to specific rules, <span class="italic">Volt</span>, and to limit <span class="italic">with whom</span> a party will arbitrate its disputes, <span class="italic">Stolt–Nielsen</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The point of affording parties discretion in designing arbitration processes is to allow for efficient, streamlined procedures tailored to the type of dispute. It can be specified, for example, that the decisionmaker be a specialist in the relevant field, or that proceedings be kept confidential to protect trade secrets. And the informality of arbitral proceedings is itself desirable, reducing the cost and increasing the speed of dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="indent">The dissent quotes <span class="italic">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd</span> (U.S.1985), as “‘reject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding goal of the Arbitration Act was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims.’” That is greatly misleading. After saying (accurately enough) that “the overriding goal of the Arbitration Act was [not] to promote the expeditious resolution of claims,” but to “ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate,” <span class="italic">Dean Witter</span> went on to explain: “This is not to say that Congress was blind to the potential benefit of the legislation for expedited resolution of disputes. Far from it ….” It then quotes a House Report saying that “the costliness and delays of litigation … can be largely eliminated by agreements for arbitration.” The concluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote_ind">“We therefore are not persuaded by the argument that the conflict between two goals of the Arbitration Act—enforcement of private agreements and encouragement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution—must be resolved in favor of the latter in order to realize the intent of the drafters.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case, of course, those “two goals” do not conflict—and it is the dissent’s view that would frustrate <span class="italic">both</span> of them.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to the dissent’s view, our cases place it beyond dispute that the FAA was designed to promote arbitration. They have repeatedly described the Act as “embod[ying] [a] national policy favoring arbitration,” <span class="italic">Buckeye Check Cashing</span>, and “a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary,” <span class="italic">Moses H. Cone</span>; see also <span class="italic">Hall Street Assocs.</span> Thus, in <span class="italic">Preston v. Ferrer,</span> holding preempted a state-law rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before arbitration, we said: “A prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve ‘streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,’ ” which objective would be “frustrated” by requiring a dispute to be heard by an agency first. That rule, we said, would “at the least, hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.”<sup><b><a id="fn_42" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-42" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></b></sup></p>
<p class="indent">California’s <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule similarly interferes with arbitration. Although the rule does not <span class="italic">require</span> classwide arbitration, it allows any party to a consumer contract to demand it <span class="italic">ex post.</span> The rule is limited to adhesion contracts, <span class="italic">Discover Bank,</span> but the times in which consumer contracts were anything other than adhesive are long past.<sup><b><a id="fn_43" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-43" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></b></sup> The rule also requires that damages be predictably small, and that the consumer allege a scheme to cheat consumers. <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span>. The former requirement, however, is toothless and malleable (the Ninth Circuit has held that damages of $4,000 are sufficiently small, and the latter has no limiting effect, as all that is <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page273" >273</span>required is an allegation. Consumers remain free to bring and resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis under <span class="italic">Discover Bank,</span> and some may well do so; but there is little incentive for lawyers to arbitrate on behalf of individuals when they may do so for a class and reap far higher fees in the process. And faced with inevitable class arbitration, companies would have less incentive to continue resolving potentially duplicative claims on an individual basis.</p>
<p class="indent">Although we have had little occasion to examine classwide arbitration, our decision in <span class="italic">Stolt–Nielsen</span> is instructive. In that case we held that an arbitration panel exceeded its power under § 10(a)(4) of the FAA by imposing class procedures based on policy judgments rather than the arbitration agreement itself or some background principle of contract law that would affect its interpretation. We then held that the agreement at issue, which was silent on the question of class procedures, could not be interpreted to allow them because the “changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration” are “fundamental.” This is obvious as a structural matter: Classwide arbitration includes absent parties, necessitating additional and different procedures and involving higher stakes. Confidentiality becomes more difficult. And while it is theoretically possible to select an arbitrator with some expertise relevant to the class-certification question, arbitrators are not generally knowledgeable in the often-dominant procedural aspects of certification, such as the protection of absent parties. The conclusion follows that class arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rather than consensual, is inconsistent with the FAA.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration—its informality—and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment. “In bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.” But before an arbitrator may decide the merits of a claim in classwide procedures, he must first decide, for example, whether the class itself may be certified, whether the named parties are sufficiently representative and typical, and how discovery for the class should be conducted. A cursory comparison of bilateral and class arbitration illustrates the difference. According to the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the average consumer arbitration between January and August 2007 resulted in a disposition on the merits in six months, four months if the arbitration was conducted by documents only. AAA, Analysis of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Caseload. As of September 2009, the AAA had opened 283 class arbitrations. Of those, 121 remained active, and 162 had been settled, withdrawn, or dismissed. Not a single one, however, had resulted in a final award on the merits. Brief for AAA as <span class="italic">Amicus Curiae</span> in <span class="italic">Stolt–Nielsen</span>. For those cases that were no longer <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page274" >274</span>active, the median time from filing to settlement, withdrawal, or dismissal—not judgment on the merits—was 583 days, and the mean was 630 days.<sup><b><a id="fn_44" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-44" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></b></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Second, class arbitration <span class="italic">requires</span> procedural formality. The AAA’s rules governing class arbitrations mimic the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for class litigation. Compare AAA, Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (2003) with Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23. And while parties can alter those procedures by contract, an alternative is not obvious. If procedures are too informal, absent class members would not be bound by the arbitration. For a class-action money judgment to bind absentees in litigation, class representatives must at all times adequately represent absent class members, and absent members must be afforded notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a right to opt out of the class. At least this amount of process would presumably be required for absent parties to be bound by the results of arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">We find it unlikely that in passing the FAA Congress meant to leave the disposition of these procedural requirements to an arbitrator. Indeed, class arbitration was not even envisioned by Congress when it passed the FAA in 1925; as the California Supreme Court admitted in <span class="italic">Discover Bank,</span> class arbitration is a “relatively recent development.” And it is at the very least odd to think that an arbitrator would be entrusted with ensuring that third parties’ due process rights are satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants. Informal procedures do of course have a cost: The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected. Defendants are willing to accept the costs of these errors in arbitration, since their impact is limited to the size of individual disputes, and presumably outweighed by savings from avoiding the courts. But when damages allegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential claimants are aggregated and decided at once, the risk of an error will often become unacceptable. Faced with even a small chance of a devastating loss, defendants will be pressured into settling questionable claims. Other courts have noted the risk of “in terrorem” settlements that class actions entail, and class arbitration would be no different.</p>
<p class="indent">Arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class litigation. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification decision on an interlocutory basis and, if unsuccessful, may appeal from a final judgment as well. Questions of law are reviewed <span class="italic">de novo</span> and questions of fact for clear error. In contrast, 9 U.S.C. § 10 allows a court to vacate an arbitral award <span class="italic">only</span> where the award “was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means”; “there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators”; “the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page275" >275</span>… or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy[,] or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced”; or if the “arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award … was not made.” The AAA rules do authorize judicial review of certification decisions, but this review is unlikely to have much effect given these limitations; review under § 10 focuses on misconduct rather than mistake. And parties may not contractually expand the grounds or nature of judicial review. <span class="italic">Hall Street Assocs.</span> We find it hard to believe that defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review, and even harder to believe that Congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision.<sup><b><a id="fn_45" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-45" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></b></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Concepcions contend that because parties may and sometimes do agree to aggregation, class procedures are not necessarily incompatible with arbitration. But the same could be said about procedures that the Concepcions admit States may not superimpose on arbitration: Parties <span class="italic">could</span> agree to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or pursuant to a discovery process rivaling that in litigation. Arbitration is a matter of contract, and the FAA requires courts to honor parties’ expectations. <span class="italic">Rent–A–Center</span>. But what the parties in the aforementioned examples would have agreed to is not arbitration as envisioned by the FAA, lacks its benefits, and therefore may not be required by state law.</p>
<p class="indent">The dissent claims that class proceedings are necessary to prosecute small-dollar claims that might otherwise slip through the legal system. But States cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons. Moreover, the claim here was most unlikely to go unresolved. As noted earlier, the arbitration agreement provides that AT &amp; T will pay claimants a minimum of $7,500 and twice their attorney’s fees if they obtain an arbitration award greater than AT &amp; T’s last settlement offer. The District Court found this scheme sufficient to provide incentive for the individual prosecution of meritorious claims that are not immediately settled, and the Ninth Circuit admitted that aggrieved customers who filed claims would be “essentially guarantee[d]” to be made whole. Indeed, the District Court concluded that the Concepcions were <span class="italic">better off</span> under their arbitration agreement with AT &amp; T than they would have been as participants in a class action, which “could take months, if not years, and which may <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page276" >276</span>merely yield an opportunity to submit a claim for recovery of a small percentage of a few dollars.”</p>
<p class="noindent">* * *</p>
<p class="indent">Because it “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,” California’s <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule is preempted by the FAA. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">It is so ordered.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ T<small>HOMAS</small>, J., concurring opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">I write separately to explain how I would find that limit in the FAA’s text. As I would read it, the FAA requires that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party successfully challenges the formation of the arbitration agreement, such as by proving fraud or duress. 9 U.S.C. §§ 2, 4. Under this reading, I would reverse the Court of Appeals because a district court cannot follow both the FAA and the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule, which does not relate to defects in the making of an agreement.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>* * *</b></p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ B<small>REYER</small>, J., dissenting opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">* * *</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>I</b></p>
<p class="indent">The California law in question consists of an authoritative state-court interpretation of two provisions of the California Civil Code. The first provision makes unlawful all contracts “which have for their object, directly or in-directly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own … violation of law.” § 1668. The second provision authorizes courts to “limit the application of any unconscionable clause” in a contract so “as to avoid any unconscionable result.” § 1670.5(a).</p>
<p class="indent">The specific rule of state law in question consists of the California Supreme Court’s application of these principles to hold that “some” (but not “all”) “class action waivers” in consumer contracts are exculpatory and unconscionable under California “law.” In particular, in <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> the California Supreme Court stated that, when a class-action waiver</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages, and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, then … the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party ‘from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another.’”</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page277" >277</div>
<p class="indent">In such a circumstance, the “waivers are unconscionable under California law and should not be enforced.”</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule does not create a “blanket policy in California against class action waivers in the consumer context.” Instead, it represents the “application of a more general [unconscionability] principle.” Courts applying California law have enforced class-action waivers where they satisfy general unconscionability standards. And even when they fail, the parties remain free to devise other dispute mechanisms, including informal mechanisms, that, in context, will not prove unconscionable. See <span class="italic">Volt Information Sciences</span> (U.S.1989).</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>II</b></p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>A</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule is consistent with the federal Act’s language. It “applies equally to class action litigation waivers in contracts without arbitration agreements as it does to class arbitration waivers in contracts with such agreements.” Linguistically speaking, it falls directly within the scope of the Act’s exception permitting courts to refuse to enforce arbitration agreements on grounds that exist “for the revocation of <span class="italic">any</span> contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2 (emphasis added). The majority agrees.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>B</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule is also consistent with the basic “purpose behind” the Act. We have described that purpose as one of “ensur[ing] judicial enforcement” of arbitration agreements. <span class="italic">Marine Transit Corp.</span> (U.S.1932) (“‘The purpose of this bill is to make <span class="italic">valid and enforceable</span> agreements for arbitration’” (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1924); emphasis added)); 65 Cong. Rec.1931 (1924) (“It creates no new legislation, grants no new rights, except a remedy to enforce an agreement in commercial contracts and in admiralty contracts”). As is well known, prior to the federal Act, many courts expressed hostility to arbitration, for example by refusing to order specific performance of agreements to arbitrate. The Act sought to eliminate that hostility by placing agreements to arbitrate “‘<span class="italic">upon the same footing as other contracts</span>.’” <span class="italic">Scherk v. Alberto–Culver Co.</span> (U.S.1974) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="indent">Congress was fully aware that arbitration could provide procedural and cost advantages. The House Report emphasized the “appropriate[ness]” of making arbitration agreements enforceable “at this time when there is so much agitation against the costliness and delays of litigation.” <span class="italic">Id.,</span> at 2. And this Court has acknowledged that parties may enter into arbitration agreements in order to expedite the resolution of disputes.</p>
<p class="indent">But we have also cautioned against thinking that Congress’ primary objective was to guarantee these particular procedural advantages. Rather, that primary objective was to secure the “enforcement” of agreements to arbitrate. <span class="italic">Dean Witter</span> <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page278" >278</span>(we “reject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the Arbitration Act was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims”); <span class="italic">id.</span> (“[T]he intent of Congress” requires us to apply the terms of the Act without regard to whether the result would be “possibly inefficient”); cf. <span class="italic">id.</span> (acknowledging that “expedited resolution of disputes” might lead parties to prefer arbitration). The relevant Senate Report points to the Act’s basic purpose when it says that “[t]he purpose of the [Act] is <span class="italic">clearly set forth in section 2,</span>” S.Rep. No. 536, at 2 (emphasis added), namely, the section that says that an arbitration agreement “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,” 9 U.S.C. § 2.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, insofar as we seek to implement Congress’ intent, we should think more than twice before invalidating a state law that does just what § 2 requires, namely, puts agreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate “upon the same footing.”</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>III</b></p>
<p class="indent">The majority’s contrary view (that <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> stands as an “obstacle” to the accomplishment of the federal law’s objective) rests primarily upon its claims that the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule increases the complexity of arbitration procedures, thereby discouraging parties from entering into arbitration agreements, and to that extent discriminating in practice against arbitration. These claims are not well founded.</p>
<p class="indent">For one thing, a state rule of law that would sometimes set aside as unconscionable a contract term that forbids class arbitration is not (as the majority claims) like a rule that would require “ultimate disposition by a jury” or “judicially monitored discovery” or use of “the Federal Rules of Evidence.” Unlike the majority’s examples, class arbitration is consistent with the use of arbitration. It is a form of arbitration that is well known in California and followed elsewhere. American Arbitration Association (AAA), Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (2003); JAMS, The Resolution Experts, Class Action Procedures (2009). Indeed, the AAA has told us that it has found class arbitration to be “a fair, balanced, and efficient means of resolving class disputes.” Brief for AAA as <span class="italic">Amicus Curiae</span> in <span class="italic">Stolt–Nielsen S.A.</span> (hereinafter AAA <span class="italic">Amicus</span> Brief). And unlike the majority’s examples, the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule imposes equivalent limitations on litigation; hence it cannot fairly be characterized as a targeted attack on arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">Where does the majority get its contrary idea—that individual, rather than class, arbitration is a “fundamental attribut[e]” of arbitration? The majority does not explain. And it is unlikely to be able to trace its present view to the history of the arbitration statute itself.</p>
<p class="indent">When Congress enacted the Act, arbitration procedures had not yet been fully developed. Insofar as Congress considered detailed forms of arbitration at all, it may well have thought that arbitration would be used primarily where merchants sought <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page279" >279</span>to resolve disputes of fact, not law, under the customs of their industries, where the parties possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power. This last mentioned feature of the history—roughly equivalent bargaining power—suggests, if anything, that California’s statute is consistent with, and indeed may help to further, the objectives that Congress had in mind.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless, if neither the history nor present practice suggests that class arbitration is fundamentally incompatible with arbitration itself, then on what basis can the majority hold California’s law pre-empted?</p>
<p class="indent">For another thing, the majority’s argument that the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule will discourage arbitration rests critically upon the wrong comparison. The majority compares the complexity of class arbitration with that of bilateral arbitration. And it finds the former more complex. See <span class="italic">ibid</span>. But, if incentives are at issue, the <span class="italic">relevant</span> comparison is not “arbitration with arbitration” but a comparison between class arbitration and judicial class actions. After all, in respect to the relevant set of contracts, the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule similarly and equally sets aside clauses that forbid class procedures—whether arbitration procedures or ordinary judicial procedures are at issue.</p>
<p class="indent">Why would a typical defendant (say, a business) prefer a judicial class action to class arbitration? AAA statistics “suggest that class arbitration proceedings take more time than the average commercial arbitration, but may take <span class="italic">less time</span> than the average class action in court.” AAA <span class="italic">Amicus</span> Brief (emphasis added). Data from California courts confirm that class arbitrations can take considerably less time than incourt proceedings in which class certification is sought. And a single class proceeding is surely more efficient than thousands of separate proceedings for identical claims. Thus, if speedy resolution of disputes were all that mattered, then the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule would reinforce, not obstruct, that objective of the Act.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority’s related claim that the <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule will discourage the use of arbitration because “[a]rbitration is poorly suited to … higher stakes” lacks empirical support. <span class="italic">Ante,</span> at 16. Indeed, the majority provides no convincing reason to believe that parties are unwilling to submit High-Stake disputes to Arbitration. and There are numerous counterexamples. Loftus, <span class="italic">Rivals Resolve Dispute Over Drug</span>, WSJ, Apr. 16, 2011 (discussing $500 million settlement in dispute submitted to arbitration); Ziobro, <span class="italic">Kraft Seeks Arbitration In Fight With Starbucks Over Distribution</span>, WSJ, Nov. 30, 2010 (describing initiation of an arbitration in which the payout “could be higher” than $1.5 billion); Markoff, <span class="italic">Software Arbitration Ruling Gives I.B.M. $833 Million From Fujitsu</span>, N.Y. Times, Nov. 30, 1988 (describing both companies as “pleased with the ruling” resolving a licensing dispute).</p>
<p class="indent">Further, even though contract defenses, <span class="italic">e.g.,</span> duress and unconscionability, slow down the dispute resolution process, federal arbitration law normally leaves such <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page280" >280</span>matters to the States. <span class="italic">Rent–A–Center</span> (2010) (arbitration agreements “may be invalidated by ‘generally applicable contract defenses’”). A provision in a contract of adhesion (for example, requiring a consumer to decide very quickly whether to pursue a claim) might increase the speed and efficiency of arbitrating a dispute, but the State can forbid it. See, <span class="italic">e.g., Hayes v. Oakridge Home</span> (Ohio 2009) (“Unconscionability is a ground for revocation of an arbitration agreement”); <span class="italic">In re Poly–America</span> (Tex.2008) (“Unconscionable contracts, however—whether relating to arbitration or not—are unenforceable under Texas law”). The <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> rule amounts to a variation on this theme. California is free to define unconscionability as it sees fit, and its common law is of no federal concern so long as the State does not adopt a special rule that disfavors arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">Because California applies the same legal principles to address the unconscionability of class arbitration waivers as it does to address the unconscionability of any other contractual provision, the merits of class proceedings should not factor into our decision. If California had applied its law of duress to void an arbitration agreement, would it matter if the procedures in the coerced agreement were efficient?</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless, the majority highlights the disadvantages of class arbitrations, as it sees them. But class proceedings have countervailing advantages. In general agreements that forbid the consolidation of claims can lead small-dollar claimants to abandon their claims rather than to litigate. I suspect that it is true even here, for as the Court of Appeals recognized, AT &amp; T can avoid the $7,500 payout (the payout that supposedly makes the Concepcions’ arbitration worthwhile) simply by paying the claim’s face value, such that “the maximum gain to a customer for the hassle of arbitrating a $30.22 dispute is still just $30.22.”</p>
<p class="indent">What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim? See, <span class="italic">e.g., Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc.</span> (C.A.7 2004) (“The <span class="italic">realistic</span> alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30”). In California’s perfectly rational view, nonclass arbitration over such sums will also sometimes have the effect of depriving claimants of their claims (say, for example, where claiming the $30.22 were to involve filling out many forms that require technical legal knowledge or waiting at great length while a call is placed on hold). <span class="italic">Discover Bank</span> sets forth circumstances in which the California courts believe that the terms of consumer contracts can be manipulated to insulate an agreement’s author from liability for its own frauds by “deliberately cheat[ing] large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.” Why is this kind of decision—weighing the pros and cons of all class proceedings alike—not California’s to make?</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the majority can find no meaningful support for its views in this Court’s precedent. The federal Act has been in force for nearly a century. We have decided <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page281" >281</span>dozens of cases about its requirements. We have reached results that authorize complex arbitration procedures. We have upheld nondiscriminatory state laws that slow down arbitration proceedings. But we have not, to my knowledge, applied the Act to strike down a state statute that treats arbitrations on par with judicial and administrative proceedings.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, we have repeatedly referred to the Act’s basic objective as assuring that courts treat arbitration agreements “like all other contracts.” <span class="italic">Buckeye Check Cashing</span> (U.S. 2006). And we have recognized that “[t]o immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial challenge” on grounds applicable to all other contracts “would be to elevate it over other forms of contract.” <span class="italic">Prima Paint Corp.</span> (U.S. 1967); see also <span class="italic">Marchant v. Mead–Morrison Mfg. Co.</span> (NY 1929) (Cardozo, C.J.) (“Courts are not at liberty to shirk the process of [contractual] construction under the empire of a belief that arbitration is beneficent any more than they may shirk it if their belief happens to be the contrary”); Cohen &amp; Dayton, 12 V<small>A</small>. L.R<small>EV</small>., at 276 (the Act “is no infringement upon the right of each State to decide for itself what contracts shall or shall not exist under its laws”).</p>
<p class="indent">These cases do not concern the merits and demerits of class actions; they concern equal treatment of arbitration contracts and other contracts. Since it is the latter question that is at issue here, I am not surprised that the majority can find no meaningful precedent supporting its decision.</p>
<p id="sec130" class="notes"><b>NOTE</b></p>
<p class="indent">Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has formally proposed a rule regulating mandatory pre-dispute arbitration clauses, 12 CFR § 1040 (May 5, 2016) that, if it becomes final, will effectively reverse the Concepcion result in credit card agreements and other consumer financial contracts (but not cell-phone agreements or other non-financial consumer contracts) within its jurisdiction that are entered into more than 180 days after the effective date of the final regulation. The rule as proposed would require those subject to CFPB regulation to afford class action remedies to consumers as a matter of federal law.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Arbitration can be seen as providing primarily a special forum for the resolution of disputes. As such, it may be useful to avoid the delay, expense, publicity, and complexity of court litigation. But its implications may be much broader. Under an arbitration clause, not only is the arbitrator substituted for the judge, but a different and simpler set of procedural and evidence rules may be substituted for those provided by the statutory law. In its broadest forms, arbitrators are not only freed from <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page282" >282</span>the constraints of the procedural codes, but are also free to decide disputes on the basis of their own sense of justice without constraint by the substantive rules established by the law. Under American arbitration law the courts generally give great deference to arbitrators and decline to review the legal merits of their decisions. A classic statement of this approach, now over a century old, indicates the breadth of this view:</p>
<p class="noindent">A<small>NDREWS</small>, J. in <span id="sec131" class="italic">Fudickar v. Guardian Mutual Life Ins. Co.</span>, 62 N.Y. 392, 399–400 (1875):</p>
<p class="indent">The arbitrator is a judge appointed by the parties; he is by their consent invested with judicial functions in the particular case; he is to determine the right as between the parties in respect to the matter submitted, and all questions of fact or law upon which the right depends are, under a general submission, deemed to be referred to him for decision. The court possesses no general supervisory power over awards, and if arbitrators keep within their jurisdiction their award will not be set aside because they have erred in judgment either upon the facts or the law. If courts should assume to rejudge the decision of arbitrators upon the merits, the value of this method of settling controversies would be destroyed, and an award instead of being a final determination of a controversy would become but one of the steps in its progress. The courts in this State have adhered with great steadiness to the general rule that awards will not be opened for errors of law or fact on the part of the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="lined" />
<p class="indent">Arbitration gives the parties power to opt out of the substantive and procedural rules established by the law and to bind themselves by their agreement to a different set of rules. However, the courts may insist that this “opting out of the law” is effective only if it is the result of a clear and unambiguous exercise of the power to make agreements. In some modern settings, even this agreement process becomes attenuated. For example, when a worker takes a job in a factory covered by a collective bargaining agreement, he takes with the job the remedial and substantive law structure created by the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the employer, and, particularly, the arbitration clause included in that agreement. It is doubtful, however, whether the individual worker has any opportunity to read, negotiate, or consent to that agreement. He takes it as he finds it. So does the fast food franchisee presented with a package agreement by the franchisor. Their position is quite similar to that of most Americans who are covered by medical insurance plans that provide for arbitration of disputes. The employee, the franchisee, the insured, and others subject to such “contractual” relationships find themselves bound into a private system of law that may be very different from that created by legislatures and the courts.</p>

<p class="sectionb">New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1998.</p>
<p class="sectionb">246 A.D.2d 374, 668 N.Y.S.2d 20.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ P<small>ER</small> C<small>URIAM</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County, entered June 26, 1995, which, to the extent appealed from, granted the petition to the extent of vacating an award made by an arbitration panel of respondent-intervenor-appellant Diamond Dealers Club (“DDC”) in favor of respondent Krischer and against petitioner in the amount of $37,371.00 and permanently enjoining DDC from enforcing that award, and denied Krischer’s cross motion to dismiss the petition and confirm said award, unanimously reversed, on the law, with costs, the petition denied and the cross motion to confirm the award granted, together with a 15% surcharge and interest. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner Sims and respondent Krischer are both members of respondent DDC, an organization whose members are in the business of buying and selling precious gems. Pursuant to the DDC bylaws and the individual membership agreements, each member agrees to be bound by the bylaws and to arbitrate all disputes with other members arising out of the diamond business before a DDC arbitration panel. The bylaws also provide that each member is personally responsible for transactions with other members whether he conducts business personally, as a member of a partnership or through a corporation, and further require that members withdrawing from a partnership or corporation must immediately notify the DDC executive offices.</p>
<p class="indent">The underlying dispute arose as a result of an August 1994 sale of diamonds from Krischer to David Sims, petitioner’s son, who had previously been employed by petitioner’s corporation, S &amp; H Diamond Corp. David Sims purchased the diamonds on behalf of his new corporation, Diamond Way Corp. (“Diamond Way”). According to Krischer however, at the time of the purchase on consignment, David Sims represented that he was still associated with his father’s diamond business.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly thereafter, Diamond Way’s diamond inventory was allegedly stolen, resulting in its filing for bankruptcy. Since Diamond Way owed substantial amounts to various creditors who were members of DDC, an arbitration hearing before a DDC arbitration panel was scheduled for October 25, 1994. Petitioner was notified by letter that claims filed by Krischer and three other members would be heard before an arbitration panel on that date. Petitioner appeared at the hearing and testified in opposition to the claims, as did David Sims. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Krischer and the three other claimants, stating in pertinent part: “After much consideration, the Arbitrators have come to the conclusion that the onus and <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page284" >284</span>responsibility falls upon Edward Sims to make good for his son, David Sims to … Sam Krischer—$37,371.00.”</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner commenced the instant proceeding to vacate the arbitration award primarily on the ground that the arbitration clause signed by all DDC members did not obligate him to arbitrate disputes between himself and his son’s bankrupt corporation, Diamond Way, with which he denied any connection. The IAS court<sup><b><a id="fn_46" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a></b></sup> agreed, finding no business connection between petitioner and Diamond Way, and that a 1987 guaranty petitioner had executed for his son’s debts had expired before the transaction at issue occurred. The court rejected the notion that “one generation is liable for the debts of another.”</p>
<p class="indent">We reverse and grant respondents’ motion to confirm the DDC’s arbitration award. CPLR 7501 instructs that courts should not “pass upon the merits of the dispute” raised in an arbitration proceeding. Indeed, judicial review is so circumspect that an arbitrator’s award will not be set aside even though the arbitrator misconstrues or disregards the agreement, or misapplies substantive rules of law, unless it violates strong public policy or is totally irrational. Rather, a party who has been served with a notice to arbitrate, or who has participated in the arbitration, may seek vacatur only on the grounds that the “the rights of that party were prejudiced by corruption, fraud or misconduct in procuring the award, partiality of an arbitrator, that the arbitrator exceeded his power or failed to make a final and definite award, or a procedural failure that was not waived (CPLR 7511, subd [b], par 1).”</p>
<p class="indent">The IAS court failed to identify any statutory ground supporting vacatur, and we conclude that none exists. Petitioner’s allegations of misconduct and partiality by DDC are baseless and require no discussion. The IAS court’s determination was apparently based on the rationale that holding petitioner liable for his son’s debt was an act in excess of the arbitrators’ powers or was simply irrational. However, considerable evidence existed to support the award. Petitioner and his son were, at one time, selling diamonds for the same corporation, rendering each of them personally liable for its obligations pursuant to DDC rules. Petitioner never notified DDC of his withdrawal from that enterprise, which is also required by DDC rules. Moreover, petitioner had executed a guaranty for his son’s debts as a condition for his son’s admission to DDC, and according to Krischer, David Sims represented that he was still affiliated with his father’s business. Although respondents apparently concede that a DDC resolution (not bylaw) limits the duration of such guarantees to five years, ample evidence existed for the arbitrators to rationally conclude that a continuing business relationship existed between petitioner and David Sims.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page285" >285</div>
<p class="indent">In any event, respondents are correct in arguing that any inquiry into these factual and legal determinations of the arbitrators is prohibited. Thus, even if we disagreed with the conclusion of the arbitrator, as did the IAS court, vacatur would be improper. An arbitrator “may do justice as he sees it, applying his own sense of law and equity to the facts as he finds them to be and making an award reflecting the spirit rather than the letter of the agreement.”</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner’s claims that the award should be vacated due to DDC’s non-compliance with the procedures of Article 75 was waived by his participation in the arbitration proceeding without objection (CPLR 7511[b][1][iv]). Similarly waived by his participation is petitioner’s claim that there was no agreement to arbitrate this dispute (CPLR 7511[b][2][ii]). Petitioner’s assertions that he was duped into attending the arbitration hearing, and thereafter refused to participate in it, are belied by the contents of the notice of arbitration letter sent to him, and his signature on the hearing attendance sheet, respectively. Nor has petitioner demonstrated he was prejudiced by the alleged procedural irregularities.</p>
<p class="indent">Since no basis exists to vacate the award, Krischer’s cross motion to confirm the arbitration award is granted, including his request for an additional 15% surcharge, which he properly calculates as $5,605. DDC’s rules permit recovery of a 15% surcharge when a party is forced to seek judicial confirmation of an arbitration award in their favor. Accordingly, Krischer is entitled to judgment in the amount of $42,976, plus interest.</p>
<p id="sec133" class="notes"><b>QUESTIONS AND NOTES</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. Does <span class="italic">Sims</span> mean that arbitrators can make up their own rules in deciding contract issues? Could an arbitrator, for example, decide to award damages in <span class="italic">Freund v. Washington Square Press</span>, p. 124, where there was insufficient evidence for the damages to be calculated with certainty?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. The principal justification for the delegation of such power to arbitrators is that the parties chose arbitration to resolve their disputes. But do you really choose to submit an unknown future dispute to arbitration by signing a form contract? Anyone who has worked as a member of a labor union or bought insurance is likely bound to arbitrate any disputes arising from the contract, whether they were aware of this fact or not. Does this sort of consent justify exercise of almost unappealable decision-making power over health care or employment issues to an arbitrator?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. What does the New York statute mean when it authorizes a court to vacate an arbitral decision if the arbitrator “exceeded his powers”? How does the court determine if this were the case? What if the arbitrator gave no explanation for his decision?</p>

<p id="sec134" class="sectiona"><b>Hall Street Associates v. Mattel</b></p>
<p class="sectionb">Supreme Court of the United States, 2008.</p>
<p class="sectionb">552 U.S. 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-squ1">■ J<small>USTICE</small> S<small>OUTER</small> delivered the Opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), provides for expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards. The question here is whether statutory grounds for prompt vacatur and modification may be supplemented by contract. We hold that the statutory grounds are exclusive.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>I</b></p>
<p class="indent">This case began as a lease dispute between landlord, petitioner Hall Street Associates, LLC, and tenant, respondent Mattel, Inc. The property was used for many years as a manufacturing site, and the leases provided that the tenant would indemnify the landlord for any costs resulting from the failure of the tenant or its predecessor lessees to follow environmental laws while using the premises.</p>
<p class="indent">Tests of the property’s well water in 1998 showed high levels of trichloroethylene (TCE), the apparent residue of manufacturing discharges by Mattel’s predecessors between 1951 and 1980. After the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) discovered even more pollutants, Mattel stopped drawing from the well and, along with one of its predecessors, signed a consent order with the DEQ providing for cleanup of the site.</p>
<p class="indent">After Mattel gave notice of intent to terminate the lease in 2001, Hall Street filed this suit, contesting Mattel’s right to vacate on the date it gave, and claiming that the lease obliged Mattel to indemnify Hall Street for costs of cleaning up the TCE, among other things. Following a bench trial, Mattel won on the termination issue, and after an unsuccessful try at mediating the indemnification claim, the parties proposed to submit to arbitration. The District Court was amenable, and the parties drew up an arbitration agreement, which the court approved and entered as an order. One paragraph of the agreement provided that</p>
<p class="blockquote-nt1">“[t]he United States District Court for the District of Oregon may enter judgment upon any award, either by confirming the award or by vacating, modifying or correcting the award. The Court shall vacate, modify or correct any award: (i) where the arbitrator’s findings of facts are not supported by substantial evidence, or (ii) where the arbitrator’s conclusions of law are erroneous.”</p>
<p class="indent">Arbitration took place, and the arbitrator decided for Mattel. In particular, he held that no indemnification was due, because the lease obligation to follow all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws did not require compliance with the testing requirements of the Oregon Drinking Water Quality Act (Oregon Act); that Act the arbitrator characterized as dealing with human health as distinct from environmental contamination.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page287" >287</div>
<p class="indent">Hall Street then filed a District Court Motion for Order Vacating, Modifying And/Or Correcting the arbitration decision on the ground that failing to treat the Oregon Act as an applicable environmental law under the terms of the lease was legal error. The District Court agreed, vacated the award, and remanded for further consideration by the arbitrator. The court expressly invoked the standard of review chosen by the parties in the arbitration agreement, which included review for legal error, and cited <span class="italic">LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp.</span>, for the proposition that the FAA leaves the parties “free … to draft a contract that sets rules for arbitration and dictates an alternative standard of review.”</p>
<p class="indent">On remand, the arbitrator followed the District Court’s ruling that the Oregon Act was an applicable environmental law and amended the decision to favor Hall Street. This time, each party sought modification, and again the District Court applied the parties’ stipulated standard of review for legal error, correcting the arbitrator’s calculation of interest but otherwise upholding the award. Each party then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where Mattel switched horses and contended that the Ninth Circuit’s recent en banc action overruling <span class="italic">LaPine</span> in <span class="italic">Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc.</span>, left the arbitration agreement’s provision for judicial review of legal error unenforceable. Hall Street countered that <span class="italic">Kyocera</span> (the later one) was distinguishable, and that the agreement’s judicial review provision was not severable from the submission to arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">The Ninth Circuit reversed in favor of Mattel in holding that, “[u]nder <span class="italic">Kyocera</span> the terms of the arbitration agreement controlling the mode of judicial review are unenforceable and severable.” The Circuit instructed the District Court on remand to</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“return to the application to confirm the original arbitration award (not the subsequent award revised after reversal), and … confirm that award, unless … the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 11.”</p>
<p class="indent">After the District Court again held for Hall Street and the Ninth Circuit again reversed<sup><b><a id="fn_47" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-47" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></b></sup> we granted certiorari to decide whether the grounds for vacatur and modification provided by §§ 10 and 11 of the FAA are exclusive.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>II</b></p>
<p class="indent">Congress enacted the FAA to replace judicial indisposition to arbitration with a “national policy favoring [it] and plac[ing] arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts.” <span class="italic">Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna</span>. As for jurisdiction <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page288" >288</span>over controversies touching arbitration, the Act does nothing, being “something of an anomaly in the field of federal-court jurisdiction” in bestowing no federal jurisdiction but rather requiring an independent jurisdictional basis.<sup><b><a id="fn_48" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-48" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></b></sup> But in cases falling within a court’s jurisdiction, the Act makes contracts to arbitrate “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,” so long as their subject involves “commerce.” And this is so whether an agreement has a broad reach or goes just to one dispute, and whether enforcement be sought in state court or federal.</p>
<p class="indent">The Act also supplies mechanisms for enforcing arbitration awards: a judicial decree confirming an award, an order vacating it, or an order modifying or correcting it. §§ 9-11. An application for any of these orders will get streamlined treatment as a motion, obviating the separate contract action that would usually be necessary to enforce or tinker with an arbitral award in court. § 6. Under the terms of § 9, a court “must” confirm an arbitration award “unless” it is vacated, modified, or corrected “as prescribed” in §§ 10 and 11. Section 10 lists grounds for vacating an award, while § 11 names those for modifying or correcting one.<sup><b><a id="fn_49" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-49" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></b></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The Courts of Appeals have split over the exclusiveness of these statutory grounds when parties take the FAA shortcut to confirm, vacate, or modify an award, with some saying the recitations are exclusive, and others regarding them as mere threshold provisions open to expansion by agreement. As mentioned already, when this litigation started, the Ninth Circuit was on the threshold side of the split from which it later departed <span class="italic">en banc</span> in favor of the exclusivity view, <span class="italic">see Kyocera</span>, which it <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page289" >289</span>followed in this case. We now hold that §§ 10 and 11 respectively provide the FAA’s exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification.</p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>III</b></p>
<p class="indent">Hall Street makes two main efforts to show that the grounds set out for vacating or modifying an award are not exclusive, taking the position, first, that expandable judicial review authority has been accepted as the law since <span class="italic">Wilko v. Swan</span> (1953). This, however, was not what <span class="italic">Wilko</span> decided, which was that § 14 of the Securities Act of 1933 voided any agreement to arbitrate claims of violations of that Act, a holding since overruled by <span class="italic">Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.</span> (1989). Although it is true that the Court’s discussion includes some language arguably favoring Hall Street’s position, arguable is as far as it goes.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">Wilko</span> Court was explaining that arbitration would undercut the Securities Act’s buyer protections when it remarked (citing FAA § 10) that “[p]ower to vacate an [arbitration] award is limited,” and went on to say that “the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard [of the law] are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation.” Hall Street reads this statement as recognizing “manifest disregard of the law” as a further ground for <span class="italic">vacatur</span> on top of those listed in § 10, and some Circuits have read it the same way. Hall Street sees this supposed addition to § 10 as the camel’s nose: if judges can add grounds to vacate (or modify), so can contracting parties.</p>
<p class="indent">But this is too much for <span class="italic">Wilko</span> to bear. Quite apart from its leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street overlooks the fact that the statement it relies on expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator’s legal errors. Then there is the vagueness of <span class="italic">Wilko</span>’s phrasing. Maybe the term “manifest disregard” was meant to name a new ground for review, but maybe it merely referred to the § 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</span> (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (“Arbitration awards are only reviewable for manifest disregard of the law”). Or, as some courts have thought, “manifest disregard” may have been shorthand for § 10(a)(3) or § 10(a)(4), the subsections authorizing <span class="italic">vacatur</span> when the arbitrators were “guilty of misconduct” or “exceeded their powers.” We, when speaking as a Court, have merely taken the <span class="italic">Wilko</span> language as we found it, with out embellishment, <span class="italic">see First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan</span> (1995), and now that its meaning is implicated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is “motivated, first and foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties ha[ve] entered.” <span class="italic">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd</span> (1985). But, again, we <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page290" >290</span>think the argument comes up short. Hall Street is certainly right that the FAA lets parties tailor some, even many features of arbitration by contract, including the way arbitrators are chosen, what their qualifications should be, which issues are arbitrable, along with procedure and choice of substantive law. But to rest this case on the general policy of treating arbitration agreements as enforceable as such would be to beg the question, which is whether the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review following the arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">To that particular question we think the answer is yes, that the text compels a reading of the §§ 10 and 11 categories as exclusive. To begin with, even if we assumed §§ 10 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand the stated grounds to the point of evidentiary and legal review generally. Sections 10 and 11, after all, address egregious departures from the parties’ agreed-upon arbitration: “corruption,” “fraud,” “evident partiality,” “misconduct,” “misbehavior,” “exceed[ing]… powers,” “evident material miscalculation,” “evident material mistake,” “award[s] upon a matter not submitted;” the only ground with any softer focus is “imperfect[ions],” and a court may correct those only if they go to “[a] matter of form not affecting the merits.” Given this emphasis on extreme arbitral conduct, the old rule of ejusdem generis has an implicit lesson to teach here. Under that rule, when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a general term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows. Since a general term included in the text is normally so limited, then surely a statute with no textual hook for expansion cannot authorize contracting parties to supplement review for specific instances of outrageous conduct with review for just any legal error. “Fraud” and a mistake of law are not cut from the same cloth.</p>
<p class="indent">That aside, expanding the detailed categories would rub too much against the grain of the § 9 language, where provision for judicial confirmation carries no hint of flexibility. On application for an order confirming the arbitration award, the court “must grant” the order “unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.” There is nothing malleable about “must grant,” which unequivocally tells courts to grant confirmation in all cases, except when one of the “prescribed” exceptions applies. This does not sound remotely like a provision meant to tell a court what to do just in case the parties say nothing else.<sup><b><a id="fn_50" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-50" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></b></sup></p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page291" >291</div>
<p class="indent">In fact, anyone who thinks Congress might have understood § 9 as a default provision should turn back to § 5 for an example of what Congress thought a default provision would look like:</p>
<p class="blockquote_ind">“[i]f in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator… such method shall be followed; but if no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, … then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator… .”</p>
<p class="blockquote">“[I]f no method be provided” is a far cry from “must grant … unless” in § 9.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see the three provisions, §§ 9-11, as substantiating a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration’s essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway. Any other reading opens the door to the full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals that can “rende[r] informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process,” <span class="italic">Kyocera</span>; and bring arbitration theory to grief in post-arbitration process.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor is <span class="italic">Dean Witter</span> to the contrary, as Hall Street claims it to be. <span class="italic">Dean Witter</span> held that state-law claims subject to an agreement to arbitrate could not be remitted to a district court considering a related, nonarbitrable federal claim; the state-law claims were to go to arbitration immediately. Despite the opinion’s language “reject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding goal of the [FAA] was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims,” the holding mandated immediate enforcement of an arbitration agreement; the Court was merely trying to explain that the inefficiency and difficulty of conducting simultaneous arbitration and federal-court litigation was not a good enough reason to defer the arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">When all these arguments based on prior legal authority are done with, Hall Street and Mattel remain at odds over what happens next. Hall Street and its <span class="italic">amici</span> say parties will flee from arbitration if expanded review is not open to them. One of Mattel’s amici foresees flight from the courts if it is. We do not know who, if anyone, is right, and so cannot say whether the exclusivity reading of the statute is more of a <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page292" >292</span>threat to the popularity of arbitrators or to that of courts. But whatever the consequences of our holding, the statutory text gives us no business to expand the statutory grounds.<sup><b><a id="fn_51" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-51" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></b></sup></p>
<p class="center_hd"><b>IV</b></p>
<p class="indent">In holding that §§ 10 and 11 provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute, we do not purport to say that they exclude more searching review based on authority outside the statute as well. The FAA is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards: they may contemplate enforcement under state statutory or common law, for example, where judicial review of different scope is arguable. But here we speak only to the scope of the expeditious judicial review under §§ 9, 10, and 11, deciding nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of arbitration awards.</p>
<p class="indent">Although one such avenue is now claimed to be revealed in the procedural history of this case, no claim to it was presented when the case arrived on our doorstep, and no reason then appeared to us for treating this as anything but an FAA case. There was never any question about meeting the FAA § 2 requirement that the leases from which the dispute arose be contracts “involving commerce.” 9 U.S.C. § 2; <span class="italic">Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson</span> (1995) (§ 2 “exercise[s] Congress’ commerce power to the full”). Nor is there any doubt now that the parties at least had the FAA in mind at the outset; the arbitration agreement even incorporates FAA § 7, empowering arbitrators to compel attendance of witnesses.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page293" >293</div>
<p class="indent">While it is true that the agreement does not expressly invoke FAA § 9, § 10, or § 11, and none of the various motions to vacate or modify the award expressly said that the parties were relying on the FAA, the District Court apparently thought it was applying the FAA when it alluded to the Act in quoting <span class="italic">LaPine</span>, for the thenunexceptional proposition that “‘[f]ederal courts can expand their review of an arbitration award beyond the FAA’s grounds, when … the parties have so agreed.’” And the Ninth Circuit, for its part, seemed to take it as a given that the District Court’s direct and prompt examination of the award depended on the FAA; it found the expanded-review provision unenforceable under <span class="italic">Kyocera</span> and remanded for confirmation of the original award “unless the district court determines that the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U.S.C. § 11.” In the petition for certiorari and the principal briefing before us, the parties acted on the same premise. <span class="italic">See, e.g.</span>, Pet. for Cert. 27 (“This Court should accept review to resolve this important issue of statutory construction under the FAA” ); Brief for Petitioner 16 (“Because arbitration provisions providing for judicial review of arbitration awards for legal error are consistent with the goals and policies of the FAA and employ a standard of review which district courts regularly apply in a variety of contexts, those provisions are entitled to enforcement under the FAA”).</p>
<p class="indent">One unusual feature, however, prompted some of us to question whether the case should be approached another way. The arbitration agreement was entered into in the course of district court litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of trial procedure, and was adopted by the District Court as an order. Hence a question raised by this Court at oral argument: should the agreement be treated as an exercise of the District Court’s authority to manage its cases under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 16? <span class="italic">See, e.g.</span>, Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. Supplemental briefing at the Court’s behest joined issue on the question, and it appears that Hall Street suggested something along these lines in the Court of Appeals, which did not address the suggestion.</p>
<p class="indent">We are, however, in no position to address the question now, beyond noting the claim of relevant case management authority independent of the FAA. The parties’ supplemental arguments on the subject in this Court implicate issues of waiver and the relation of the FAA both to Rule 16 and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, none of which has been considered previously in this litigation, or could be well addressed for the first time here. We express no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand. If the Court of Appeals finds they are open, the court may consider whether the District Court’s authority to manage litigation independently warranted that court’s order on the mode of resolving the indemnification issues remaining in this case.</p>

<p class="indent">May parties to an ongoing lawsuit agree to submit their dispute to arbitration subject to the caveat that the trial judge should refuse to enforce an award that rests on an erroneous conclusion of law? Prior to Congress’ enactment of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) in 1925, the answer to that question would surely have been “Yes.”<sup><b><a id="fn_52" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-52" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></b></sup> Today, however, the Court holds that the FAA does not merely authorize the vacation or enforcement of awards on specified grounds, but also forbids enforcement of perfectly reasonable judicial review provisions in arbitration agreements fairly negotiated by the parties and approved by the district court. Because this result conflicts with the primary purpose of the FAA and ignores the historical context in which the Act was passed, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to the passage of the FAA, American courts were generally hostile to arbitration. They refused, with rare exceptions, to order specific enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate. Section 2 of the FAA responded to this hostility by making written arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.” This section, which is the centerpiece of the FAA, reflects Congress’ main goal in passing the legislation: “to abrogate the general common-law rule against specific enforcement of arb itration agreements,” <span class="italic">Southland Corp. v. Keating</span> (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and to “ensur[e] that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms,” <span class="italic">Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</span> (1989). Given this settled understanding of the core purpose of the FAA, the interests favoring enforceability of parties’ arbitration agreements are stronger today than before the FAA was enacted. As such, there is more—and certainly not less—reason to give effect to parties’ fairly negotiated decisions to provide for judicial review of arbitration awards for errors of law.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner filed this rather complex action in an Oregon state court. Based on the diverse citizenship of the parties, respondent removed the case to federal court. More than three years later, and after some issues had been resolved, the parties sought and obtained the District Court’s approval of their agreement to arbitrate <span class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page295" >295</span> the remaining issues subject to de novo judicial review. They neither requested, nor suggested that the FAA authorized, any “expedited” disposition of their case. Because the arbitrator made a rather glaring error of law, the judge refused to affirm his award until after that error was corrected. The Ninth Circuit reversed.</p>
<p class="indent">This Court now agrees with the Ninth Circuit’s (most recent) interpretation of the FAA as setting forth the exclusive grounds for modification or vacation of an arbitration award under the statute. As I read the Court’s opinion, it identifies two possible reasons for reaching this result: (1) a supposed <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span> bargain between Congress and litigants that conditions expedited federal enforcement of arbitration awards on acceptance of a statutory limit on the scope of judicial review of such awards; and (2) an assumption that Congress intended to include the words “and no other” in the grounds specified in §§ 10 and 11 for the vacatur and modification of awards. Neither reason is persuasive.</p>
<p class="indent">While § 9 of the FAA imposes a 1-year limit on the time in which any party to an arbitration may apply for confirmation of an award, the statute does not require that the application be given expedited treatment. Of course, the premise of the entire statute is an assumption that the arbitration process may be more expeditious and less costly than ordinary litigation, but that is a reason for interpreting the statute liberally to favor the parties’ use of arbitration. An unnecessary refusal to enforce a perfectly reasonable category of arbitration agreements defeats the primary purpose of the statute.</p>
<p class="indent">That purpose also provides a sufficient response to the Court’s reliance on statutory text. It is true that a wooden application of “the old rule of ejusdem generis,” might support an inference that the categories listed in §§ 10 and 11 are exclusive, but the literal text does not compel that reading—a reading that is flatly inconsistent with the overriding interest in effectuating the clearly expressed intent of the contracting parties. A listing of grounds that must always be available to contracting parties simply does not speak to the question whether they may agree to additional grounds for judicial review.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, in light of the historical context and the broader purpose of the FAA, §§ 10 and 11 are best understood as a shield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties’ “valid, irrevocable and enforceable” agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law.<sup><b><a id="fn_53" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn-53" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></b></sup> § 2.</p>
<div class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page296" >296</div>
<p class="indent">Even if I thought the narrow issue presented in this case were as debatable as the conflict among the courts of appeals suggests, I would rely on a presumption of overriding importance to resolve the debate and rule in favor of petitioner’s position that the FAA permits the statutory grounds for vacatur and modification of an award to be supplemented by contract. A decision “not to regulate” the terms of an agreement that does not even arguably offend any public policy whatsoever, “is adequately justified by a presumption in favor of freedom.” <span class="italic">FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.</span> (1993) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, while I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be set aside, and that there may be additional avenues available for judicial enforcement of parties’ fairly negotiated review provisions, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s interpretation of the FAA, and would direct the Court of Appeals to affirm the judgment of the District Court enforcing the arbitrator’s final award.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. While the speed and efficiency of arbitration are often touted by its proponents, large and complex arbitrations frequently take years to resolve, and, particularly in high stakes cases, arbitration can often be more expensive than traditional litigation, primarily because judges tend to limit the length of hearings to a greater degree than do arbitrators. <span class="italic">See</span> Thomas Stipanowich, <span class="italic">Rethinking American Arbitration</span>, 63 I<small>ND</small>. L.J. at 484 (1988). For many years now, arbitration has been the preferred form of dispute resolution in international transactions. But as international arbitration has come to increasingly resemble American-style litigation, but without appellate review, that may be changing. The ABA J<small>OURNAL</small> recently reported that: “A growing number of businesses appear to be turning away from arbitration and resolving their international commercial disputes the old-fashioned way—in the courts. In a targeted survey of corporate counsel published in 2006 by the School of International Arbitration at Queen Mary, University of London, only 11 percent of in-house counsel said they preferred litigation to settle international disputes. In a follow-up survey conducted two years later, that figure rose to 41 percent—only slightly less than the number who prefer international arbitration.” Steven Seidenberg, <span class="italic">International Arbitration Loses Its Grip</span>, ABA J<small>OURNAL</small> (Apr. 2010). One important persistent advantage to arbitration over adjudication in the international arena is that arbitral awards are more easily enforced in many parts of the world under the New York Convention, <span class="italic">see</span> Note, p. 257, than are foreign court judgments.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>2</b>. How can Hall Street’s consent to arbitrate subject to appellate review be deemed consent to arbitrate without appellate review? Would Hall Street have had any better luck challenging the contractual arbitration clause prior to the completion of the arbitration?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>3</b>. Do repeat players have a greater or lesser structural advantage in arbitration than in traditional litigation? In thinking about this question, consider that arbitrators are compensated by the parties, are generally free from appellate review, and are not bound to follow precedent or give reasons for their decisions. Under what circumstances would you prefer to litigate before an arbitrator rather than a judge or jury?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>4</b>. While <span class="italic">Hall Street</span> does not on its face disavow <span class="italic">Wilko</span>’s <span class="italic">dicta</span> permitting a court to vacate an award that issues in “manifest disregard of the law,” following <span class="italic">Hall Street</span> some courts have found that even “manifest disregard of the law” is no longer a basis to vacate because of the Court’s holding in <span class="italic">Hall Street</span> that the statutory grounds for review are exclusive. Those grounds do not expressly include “manifest disregard of the law.” <span class="italic">See, e.g., Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp.</span>, 604 F.3d 1313 (11th Cir. 2010); <span class="italic">Citigroup Global Markets v. Bacon</span>, 562 F.3d 349 (5th Cir. 2009). The Ninth Circuit, however, has found, notwithstanding <span class="italic">Hall Street,</span> that arbitral awards may still be vacated if “completely irrational” or “the arbitrators recognized the applicable law and then ignored it.” <span class="italic">Lagstein v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, London</span>, 607 F.3d 634 (9th Cir. 2010).</p>

<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-31" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_31" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>.  Of course, if CSE had not previously paid out $114,758.98 to Palmer, there could have been some amount due to Palmer. That is the situation that has usually been illustrated by the commentators. But payment had been made. Far from being entitled to recover more, Palmer should have been ordered to disgorge part of what it already had received.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-32" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_32" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a>.  The court specifically announced it was “not following some mechanical or mathematical formula, but attempting to determine what dollar figure constitutes the reasonable value of the services plaintiff performed.” Although the testimony of the WDI principals was in conflict, the anticipated future needs of Fisher were communicated to WDI far in advance of receipt of Fisher’s actual purchase orders. As a consequence, there was a “lag time” of many months between Fisher’s notice to prepare for an upcoming order and WDI’s invoicing and shipment. While not an element of the referee’s report, the court considered this factor as well in determining the reasonable compensation due Watson.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-33" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_33" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a>.  Watson relies upon the following statement by the court at the hearing on WDI’s motion for new trial, a year after trial.</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">Certainly it’s not a traditional case in any respect. But probably because of the numbers involved and that you have plaintiff who was retained or at least in some way hired to bring a certain customer to your company. He performed.</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">And in fact the accounting showed that because of that, during the accounting period some $9–million of gross business was brought to the company. In any situation where you have that volume you’re going to have substantial commissions involved. And your people want to pay something like 24 or $25,000. “In weighing all those factors [in the statement of decisions] the court was simply trying to some to the reasonable value of the services rendered. I may be off the mark on the reasonable value, but in my view, I’m probably low.”</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">I think that you look at that line of cases, although not in California, that talk about commissions going on for the life of the contract or the life of the involvement between Fisher—Fisher and Wood Dimensions—I think that the Appellate Court might adopt that line of cases for California. I couldn’t find any California case that goes that far. Obviously counsel couldn’t either. But certainly the individual is entitled to compensation for the amount of gross business he brought the company.</p>
<p class="fn_txti1">So I decided it on the reasonable value of the services rendered, weighing all the factors I thought were brought in. * * * The testimony was very clear that his primary function was to bring back the Fisher contract, and that the company was in dire straits without it.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-34" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a>.  Of course, a wrongfully discharged employee may suffer injuries not compensable by contract damages, such as foreclosure of a mortgage on a home because of the owner employee’s inability to make required payments.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-35" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_35" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  The early English history of enforcement of executory arbitration agreements is not too clear. Arbitration was used by the medieval guilds and in early maritime transactions. Some persons trace an influence back to Roman law, doubtless itself affected by Greek law; others discern the influence of ecclesiastical law.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-36" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a>  Copyright, 1973, American Bar Association.</p>

Our opinion today addresses only the former, and does not speak to the issue decided in the cases cited by respondents (and by the Florida Supreme Court), which hold that it is for courts to decide whether the alleged obligor ever signed the contract, whether the signor lacked authority to commit the alleged principal, and whether the signor lacked the mental capacity to assent.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-38" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_38" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>.  In pertinent part, § 4 reads:</p>
<p class="fn_txt2">“A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any United States district court [with jurisdiction] … for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in a manner provided for in such agreement … .[U]pon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement … .”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-39" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_39" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>.  Our more natural reading is confirmed by the use of the word “contract” elsewhere in the United States Code to refer to putative agreements, regardless of whether they are legal. For instance, the Sherman Act, as amended, states that “[e]very contract, combination …, or conspiracy in restraint of trade … is hereby declared to be illegal.” Under respondents’ reading of “contract,” a bewildering circularity would result: A contract illegal because it was in restraint of trade would not be a “contract” at all, and thus the statutory prohibition would not apply.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-40" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_40" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>.  That provision further states that “the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.”</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-41" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_41" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>.  The guaranteed minimum recovery was increased in 2009 to $10,000.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-42" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_42" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>.  Relying upon nothing more indicative of congressional understanding than statements of witnesses in committee hearings and a press release of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the dissent suggests that Congress “thought that arbitration would be used primarily where merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact … [and] possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power.” <span class="italic">Post,</span> at 6. Such a limitation appears nowhere in the text of the FAA and has been explicitly rejected by our cases. “Relationships between securities dealers and investors, for example, may involve unequal bargaining power, but we [have] nevertheless held … that agreements to arbitrate in that context are enforceable.” <span class="italic">Gilmer</span> (U.S. 1991) (allowing arbitration of claims arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 despite allegations of unequal bargaining power between employers and employees). Of course the dissent’s disquisition on legislative history fails to note that it contains nothing—not even the testimony of a stray witness in committee hearings—that contemplates the existence of class arbitration.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-43" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_43" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a>.  Of course States remain free to take steps addressing the concerns that attend contracts of adhesion—for example, requiring class-action-waiver provisions in adhesive arbitration agreements to be highlighted. Such steps cannot, however, conflict with the FAA or frustrate its purpose to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-44" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_44" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a>.  The dissent claims that class arbitration should be compared to class litigation, not bilateral arbitration. Whether arbitrating a class is more desirable than litigating one, however, is not relevant. A State cannot defend a rule requiring arbitration-by-jury by saying that parties will still prefer it to trial-by-jury.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-45" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_45" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>.  The dissent cites three large arbitration awards (none of which stems from classwide arbitration) as evidence that parties are willing to submit large claims before an arbitrator. Those examples might be in point if it could be established that the size of the arbitral dispute was predictable when the arbitration agreement was entered. Otherwise, all the cases prove is that arbitrators can give huge awards—which we have never doubted. The point is that in class-action arbitration huge awards (with limited judicial review) will be entirely predictable, thus rendering arbitration unattractive. It is not reasonably deniable that requiring consumer disputes to be arbitrated on a classwide basis will have a substantial deterrent effect on incentives to arbitrate.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-46" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">*</a>  E<small>DITOR</small>’<small>S</small> N<small>OTE</small>: “IAS Court” refers to a New York procedure pursuant to which civil matters are assigned to a single Supreme Court Justice for all purposes at the trial level. “IAS” is an acronym for “Individual Assignment System.”</p>

Mattel appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that implausibility is not a valid ground for vacating or correcting an award under § 10 or § 11.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-48" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_48" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>.  Because the FAA is not jurisdictional, there is no merit in the argument that enforcing the arbitration agreement’s judicial review provision would create federal jurisdiction by private contract. The issue is entirely about the scope of judicial review permissible under the FAA.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-49" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_49" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>.  Title 9 U.S.C. § 10(a) provides: “(a) In any of the following cases the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration—“(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; “(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them; “(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or “(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” Title 9 U.S.C. § 11 (2000 ed.) provides: “In either of the following cases the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order modifying or correcting the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration—“(a) Where there was an evident material miscalculation of figures or an evident material mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award. “(b) Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted. “(c) Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy. “The order may modify and correct the award, so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.”</p>

It is a peculiar argument, converting agreement as a necessary condition for judicial enforcement into a sufficient condition for a court to bar enforcement. And the text is otherwise problematical for Hall Street: § 9 says that if the parties have agreed to judicial enforcement, the court “must grant” confirmation unless grounds for vacatur or modification exist under § 10 or § 11. The sentence nowhere predicates the court’s judicial action on the parties’ having agreed to specific standards; if anything, it suggests that, so long as the parties contemplated judicial enforcement, the court must undertake such enforcement under the statutory criteria. In any case, the arbitration agreement here did not specifically predicate entry of judgment on adherence to its judicialreview standard. To the extent Hall Street argues otherwise, it contests not the meaning of the FAA but the Ninth Circuit’s severability analysis, upon which it did not seek certiorari.</p>
<p class="fn_txt"><a id="fn-51" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781683284246/epub/OEBPS/14_chapter03.xhtml?favre=brett#fn_51" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a>.  The history of the FAA is consistent with our conclusion. The text of the FAA was based upon that of New York’s arbitration statute. <span class="italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924) (“The bill … follows the lines of the New York arbitration law enacted in 1920 …”). The New York Arbitration Law incorporated pre-existing provisions of the New York Code of Civil Procedure. Section 2373 of the code said that, upon application by a party for a confirmation order, “the court must grant such an order, unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed by the next two sections.” 2 N. Y. Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (Stover 6th ed. 1902) (herein after Stover). The subsequent sections gave grounds for vacatur and modification or correction virtually identical to the 9 U.S.C. §§ 10 and 11 grounds. <span class="italic">See</span> 2 Stover §§§§ 2374, 2375. In a brief submitted to the House and Senate Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, Julius Henry Cohen, one of the primary drafters of both the 1920 New York Act and the proposed FAA, said, “The grounds for vacating, modifying, or correcting an award are limited. If the award [meets a condition of § 10], then and then only the award may be vacated… . If there was [an error under § 11], then and then only it may be modified or corrected … .” The House Report similarly recognized that an “award may … be entered as a judgment, subject to attack by the other party for fraud and corruption and similar undue influence, or for palpable error in form.” In a contemporaneous campaign for the promulgation of a uniform state arbitration law, Cohen contrasted the New York Act with the Illinois Arbitration and Awards Act of 1917, which required an arbitrator, at the request of either party, to submit any question of law arising during arbitration to judicial determination.</p>
